      "✓ Recall: 0.800 (moderate false negative rate)\n",
      "\n",
      "6.2 Information Expressiveness\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "• LLM successfully extracts multiple insomnia-related features\n",
      "• Feature extraction coverage: 1.63% of sentences\n",
      "• Co-occurrence patterns align with clinical phenotypes\n",
      "\n",
      "6.3 Completeness\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "• Patient coverage: 50/60 patients\n",
      "• Main limitation: 6 false negatives due to:\n",

      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "• Rule A (Symptoms): Most challenging - requires both features\n",
      "• Rule B (Primary Meds): Best performance - clear vocabulary\n",
      "• Rule C (Secondary Meds): Moderate - medication detection strong\n",
      "\n",
      "6.5 Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "1. Expand keyword vocabulary for sentence extraction\n",
