Brief Hospital Course:
___ y.o female with h.o paranoid schizophrenia, HTN, HL, DM who 
presents with incontinence and abdominal pain and UTI and 
several abscesses s/p large MRSA perirectal abscess drainage in 
the OR. 
.
# R buttock abscess and several other sm buttock and thigh 
abscesses: Surgery consulted and drained large perirectal 
abscess in OR ___ and again ___. Cultures grew MRSA 
sensitive to doxycycline, bactrim, and vancomycin (as well as sm 
amt of corynebacterium). Pt initially started on doxycycline but 
this was transitioned to vancomycin after infectious disease 
consultation. She was transitioned to bactim and will complete a 
full course of this. Pt had several additional abscesses, 
including one on R thigh that was I+Ded at bedside (by surgery). 
Pt had careful wound care to buttock wound to avoid stool 
contamination and foley to avoid keeping the wound wet (pt 
frequently incontinent and retained urine often). However, 
patient did not need a foley near the end of her discharge. 
Prior to discharge patient did not have a foley and her urine 
volume was less than 200 cc. Discharged without a foley. Pt's 
pain was controlled c oxycodone plus dilaudid for dressing 
changes. However, near the end of her discharge, patient 
required minimal pain medication. 
.
# UTI: Pt found to have pan-sensitive pseudomonas. She was 
treated with ciprofloxacin for 5 doses (combination of IV and PO 
as pt sometimes refused PO meds and sometimes pulled out her 
IVs). Her last dose was IM cefepime (as pt refusing POs and had 
no IV access at the time. Repeat UA and Ucx without growth.
.
# abd pain on admission: ? ___ UTI. Pt had ab/pelvis CT on 
admission which was reassuring and abd pain improved c treatment 
of UTI. She continued to have intermittent lower abdominal pain 
when foley was out. Patient intermittently retained urine and 
foley improved her pain. Patient's foley was removed for >48 
hours prior to discharge and she was not retaining, however 
incontinent. She did not have pain. Bladder scan prior to 
discharge was less than 200 cc.
.
# Elevated INR: Pt noted to have elevated INR and low albumin 
and mildly enlarged liver on CT abd/pelvis. Hepatitis serologies 
were negative and INR improved c 3d of vitamin K. 
.
# Constipation: Pt started on miralax, colace, senna, bisacodyl. 

.
# Hypotension on admission: pt's blood pressure meds were held 
and her BP trended up. Enalapril was planned for continuation, 
however she developed a slight increase in her Cr to 1.3 (from 
1.0). She was given fluids prior to discharge as her labs 
appeared hemo-concentrated. Cr should be re-checked two days 
post-discharge in rehab and this medication should be 
re-evaluated.  HCTZ was discontinued.
.
# urinary retention: has been an occasional issue over the past 
___ months per her daughter. The etiology is unclear but 
initially felt to be ___ benztropine which was discontinued 
prior to admission. Haldol and klonopin can both cause urinary 
retention, however, neither of these meds are new to her, make 
this etiology less likely. Pt had foley placed after an episode 
of 900cc of urinary retention. It was initially planned that the 
foley would quickly be discontinued, however, it was ultimately 
continued through most of her admission ___ concern about her 
wound site getting wet as pt is incontinent. However was 
discontinued two days prior to discharge as patient consistently 
pulled it out. She did not retain urine and her dressing changes 
were more frequent (up to ___ times per day) to ensure a clean 
abscess site. Patient tolerated this well. 
  
# psychogenic polydipsia: free water restricted to 2L. Pt did 
not seem interested in drinking excessively during this 
admission.
.
# petichiae: Pt noted to have diffuse petichiae on lower 
extremities and chest. her CBC was checked and was within normal 
limits. Petichiae resolved. 
.  
# Paranoid schizophrenia: Pt was followed by our psychiatry 
department. She was continued on her meds from psych facility 
(haldol, klonopin, celexa, tegretol, zyprexa). Zyprexa and 
haldol were given IM when pt refused PO. Pt has ___ 
guardianship.  EKG showed stable QTc interval.
.  
# DM type 2, uncontrolled: On admission, pt was on sliding 
scale, she had also been discharged on 70/30 though it was 
unclear whether she had been getting 70/30 at her psych 
facility. Pt was started on lantus and humalog sliding scale 
which were titrated up aggressively given her elevated blood 
sugars. She maintainted appropriate blood sugars on regimen of 
44 units of Lantus with HISS.

# Anemia: continued iron supplementation. b12 and folate wnl. 
-Recommend outpt colonoscopy when psychosis improved (this was 
discussed with pt's daughter)

# CKD: at recent baseline, however had small increase in Cr to 
1.3. Likely pre-renal as further labs appeared hemoconcentrated. 
Gave IVFs prior to discharge. Should be rechecked in 2 days for 
further management.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to ___ for a urinary tract infection. We 
treated this with an antiobiotic called ciprofloxacin. You were 
also found to have several abscesses including one large 
___ abscess which was drained in the operating room 
under anesthesia twice. You recieved antibiotics for these 
abscesses and will need to continue while you are in rehab. Your 
sugars were very high, which probably made you more likely to 
get abscesses. We increased your insulin regimen. Good control 
of sugars is very important for fighting infection, for your 
heart and nerves and almost all of the rest of your body. 
Lastly, you seemed to be having incontinence with a full bladder 
(called overflow incontinence). You had a bladder catheter 
placed which help your incontinence and also helped keep your 
wound clean, however, you continued to pull it out. We kept it 
out and you appeared to be urinating without diffuclty. Prior to 
discharge we checked the amount of urine in your bladder and it 
appeared you were not retaining very much urine (< 200 cc) You 
may need to have one in intermittently if you continue to hold 
your urine. 

You should take your medications as prescribed with the 
following important changes.
1. CONTINUE: Bactrim DS 1 tablet every 12 hours every day and 
stop on ___
2. INCREASE Lantus to 44 units at bedtime. Please use sliding 
scale for further insulin coverage
3. HOLD Enalapril as you have some mild kidney dysfunction. You 
will have your kidney function monitored and this should be 
re-started once this normalizes.
4. STOP: HCTZ
5. Continue wound care as directed
6. START: Oxycodone as needed for pain
7. Continue Olanzapine and Haldol as directed.

It is important that you keep all of your doctor's appointments

Pertinent Results:
Troponin T <0.01, <0.___rief Hospital Course by Problem: 

#) Status post fall: on presentation to ___ patient was 
initially evaluated in the ER, and given that she had 
experienced an unwitnessed fall, she had multiple radiographic 
studies for furhter evaluation, CT of head showed no 
intracranial bleeding, CT of her cervical spine showed no 
fractures or dislocations, x-rays of her shoulders did not show 
any evidence of fracture.  Additionally in the ER, since her 
cervical spine had been cleared radiographically, they tried to 
clear her c-spine and take the cervical collar off but she 
complained of continued neck pain.  After speaking with 
neurosurgery, they recommended leaving the collar on for 2 weeks 
and then reassessing to see if her pain had resolved to take the 
collar off.  Patient can be seen by orthopedic surgery in two 
weeks for re-evaluation of the cervical collar.  Since the fall 
was unwitnessed and the patient was unable to give a good 
history, there was concern for the cause of this fall, patient 
was monitored on telemetry and also had an echocardiogram.  The 
echocardiogram was unchanged from prior studies, and while she 
was monitored on telemetry, it was noted that with reinitiation 
of her atenolol the patient's HR dropped to 35 while she was 
sleeping and then increased to the 40's when the nurses had 
woken her up.  Per nursing it was difficult to tell whether she 
was symptomatic since she seemed slightly confused at baseline.  
Given her decreased heart rate her atenolol was stopped and to 
control the patient's blood pressure, she was started on an ACE 
Inhibitor, lisinopril 10mg daily, that can be further titrated 
as an outpatient.  

#) Hypertension: Patient had previously been treated with 
atenolol 25mg daily, however given her very decreased HR, the 
medication was discontinued.  In the short term in the hospital 
she was controlled with 20mg po hydralazine, however for long 
term control she will be started on lisinopril 10mg daily, which 
can be titrated up as an outpatient.  Since she was just started 
on lisinopril, she will need to have her electrolytes checked in 
one week.

#) Dementia: remained stable in the hospital, continued her 
outpatient dose of aricept

#) Hypothyroid: currently being managed by her PCP, continued on 
her home synthroid dose

#) Osteoporosis: patient was continued on her calcium and 
vitamin D supplementation, however we would hold her 
bisphosphonate until the cervical collar is removed so that the 
patient can sit upright and take the medication safely. 

#) CAD: repeat echocardiogram showed no decline in LV systolic 
function, will continue aspirin but atenolol has been 
discontinued as patient's heart rate cannot tolerate beta 
blockade

Facility:
___
 
Discharge Diagnosis:
1. Status Post Mechanical Fall

 
Discharge Condition:
At the time of discharge, patient was able to ambulate with a 
walker, tolerate oral intake without difficulty, her heart had 
increased off atenolol, other vital signs were stable and she 
was medically clear for discharge. 

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to ___ after falling at the nursing home, 
when you arrived in the emergency room, multiple radiology 
studies were done, which showed that you did have any bleeding 
your head or any other broken bones.  However, since you were 
still complaining of neck pain, even though the CT scan of the 
bones in your neck was normal, they were unable to remove the 
cervical collar.  Since no one had seen you fall, we were 
concerned about caused the fall, as a result we also did an 
echocardiogram to look at the function of your heart and 
monitored the rhythm of your heart while you were in the 
hospital.  The only concerning finding during your 
hospitalization was that when we restarted your atenolol, your 
heart rate decreased into the 30's while you were sleeping, and 
only increased into the 40's when you were awake, as a result we 
stopped this medication since we were concerned that this could 
have contributed to your fall.   

Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you have 
any other falls, experience a change in your vision, headaches, 
chest pain, palpitations or any other concerning symptoms.

History of Present Illness:
___ year old female past medical history of dementia, 
hypothyroid, hip replacement presenting from outside hospital 
with concern for new T9/T10 fracture status post mechanical 
fall.  
.  
Patient is a poor historian at baseline and unable to provide 
additional history. Based on review of medical record, she had a 
witnessed fall that was mechanical in nature immediately prior 
to presentation at outside hospital. No head strike, no loss of 
consciousness, no seizure activity. At the outside hospital, she 
had a CT of her head, neck, torso that reveals a T9/T10 
fracture. No other acute findings were appreciated. She was 
transferred for spinal surgery evaluation.  
.  
In the ED, initial vitals 97.9 66 188/72 18 97%. Imaging from 
___ were reviewed including CT Head, neck, torso which 
revealed t9/10 fx. ___ was consulted who recommeneded TLSO. 
While in the emergency department patient spiked a fever to 102. 
Fever work up was negative for evidence of meningitis, no 
pneumonia on CT torso. UA was performed which revealed 24 WBC, 6 
RBC, NO Bacteria. Blood and urine cultures were sent and are 
pending. Blood counts and renal function at baseline. Patient 
was given acetaminophen 650mg suppository. CT of the abdomen was 
performed which revealed pneumobilia and dilated common bile 
duct. Surgery was consulted and felt that this was similar to 
prior CT examination and recommended no intervention. Patient 
did recieve flagyl, however no other antibiotics were given as 
they were felt to not be indicated. Vitals on transfer to the 
floor 98.2, 114/78, 82, 16, 97%RA.

Studies:
.
CT Abd - IMPRESSION: 1. Unchanged moderate intra- and 
extrahepatic biliary dilation with smooth tapering of the 
hepatic duct below the insertion of the cystic duct. Gallbladder 
distension is likely related to the ductal process rather than 
acute cholecystitis given the lack of wall thickening or 
pericholecystic fluid but clinical correlation is advised. 2. 
Possible 12-mm hypodensity in the head of the pancreas which is 
most likely focal fat deposition and is unchanged from the prior 
study. A mass cannot be entirely excluded and MRCP could be 
obtained if clinically relevant. 3. No findings to explain a 
sterile pyuria. 4. Colonic diverticulosis without evidence of 
acute diverticulitis. 5. Marked degenerative changes of the 
thoracolumbar ___ with further cortical destruction of the T9 
vertebral body. 
.
MR ___ - 1. Findings involving the T9 vertebral body, as on 
the prompting CT, likely represent a relatively acute 
osteoporotic compression fracture with very prominent fracture 
cleft. 2. While there is no significant loss of height, there is 
some retropulsion of its dorsal cortex with possible impingement 
upon the exiting right T9 nerve root. 3. Associated abnormality 
of, particularly, the right anterolateral paraspinal soft 
tissues at this level, with an overall appearance most 
suggestive of associated hemorrhage/granulation tissue, with no 
finding to specifically suggest a neoplastic process. 4. Bone 
marrow signal abnormalities involving the contiguous T10 
vertebral body, supporting underlying osteoporotic nature of 
this process, related to axial- loading injury. 5. Several 
chronic thoracolumbar vertebral wedge deformities with 
retropulsion, as detailed; in particular, there is significant 
spinal canal narrowing at the T12-L1 level, with deformity of 
the distal spinal cord but no discrete signal abnormality. 6. No 
other pathologic focus of enhancement seen to specifically 
suggest neoplastic disease. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female past medical history of dementia, 
hypothyroid, hip replacement presenting from outside hospital 
with concern for new T9/T10 fracture status post fall who 
developed fevers in the ED.  
.  
#. Mechanical Fall: Initially there was concern for T9/T10 
Fracture at ___. The pt was transfered to ___ for 
orthopedics ___ eval who determined that the fracture was not 
acute. They recommended a TLSO for comfort only. Due to concern 
for possible malignancy, the patient underwent MRI scan of the 
___ on ___ which showed a relatively acute osteoporotic 
compression fracture with very 
prominent fracture cleft but no evidence of neoplastic disease. 
The patient was in a significant amount of back pain initially 
and received a combination of opiates, toradol, standing tylenol 
and lidocaine patch. In discussion with the patient's nursing 
facility it was determined that this pain was not much changed 
from the patient's baseline and that at the nursing facility the 
patient receives oxycontin 30mg BID. The patient was placed on 
this regimen with good improvement in pain although continues to 
have difficulty with turns/sitting/deep breahing. The TLSO brace 
was not yet ready at time of discharge. Discharged with plan for 
further pain management per provider at ___. Of 
note, a vertebroplasty was discussed to help palliate the 
patient's pain however it was decided that the risks outwighed 
benefits in this ___ year-old woman.
.  
#. Fever: The patient develoepd a fever to 102.0 in the ED. No 
clear source was identified initially. A UA showed pyuria 
however no bacteria and was nitrite negative. A CT torso at 
___ without evidence of pulmonary infiltrate.  Pt 
arrived to floor with foley in place, per records it was placed 
at ___ prior to transfer. This foley was removed on 
admission to the floor. Blood and Urine cultures remained 
negative and a respiratory viral screen including influenza was 
negative. The patient was afebrile throughout the remainder of 
her hospital course. 
.  
#Dementia- Pt severely demented at baseline per family. In the 
hosiptial she was oriented to eprson and place. At times able to 
answer questions appropriately. Continued on home donepezil.
.  
#Hypothyroidism- Continued home levothyroxine.
.
#. Transitional Issues:

transferred to ___ for management of possible wrist 
compartment syndrome.
.
# Alcoholic Pancreatitis: The patient presented with severe 
epigastric pain, an inability to tolerate PO, and abnormal LFTs. 
She was found to have hyperbilirubinemia, transaminitis, 
hyponatremia and an anion gap metabolic acidosis. She was given 
IV fluids and IV morphine for pain control. Over the course of 
her stay, the patient started to tolerate a regular diet without 
nausea and vomiting. Her pain was better controlled and her LFTs 
trended to normal ranges. The patient was discharged with 16 
pills of Percocet and told to followup at her scheduled 
appointment or sooner with her primary care doctor if she 
requires more pain control. 

# ETOH Dependence/Withdrawl: The patient reportedly had been 
drinking heavily over the past year. During her stay, she 
developed increased anxiety, tremulousness, fever, and 
tachycardia. She was started on a CIWA scale and required PO 
Valium to help her. She also reports vivid nightmares. Social

intervention and suggested keeping the arm elevated and 
controlling her pain. With elevation, the pain subsided. The 
hand always remained neurovascularly intact and had normal 
pulses/strength/sensation on discharge. Ortho hand said to 
followup PRN in their clinic.

Normocytic anemia: The patient continued to have a normocytic 
anemia. It was stable throughout her stay. If it persists, it 
will likely need to be assessed as an outpatient. On discharge

#). Anxiety: Pt reports long history of severe anxiety with 
chest pressure, racing thoughts, diaphoresis, inner feeling of 
restlessness previously treated with numerous high-dose 
medication (thorazine, seroquel, neurontin). 
- Although akathesia was certainly on the differential, pt 
described feelings of restlessness prior to initiation of 
antipsychotics. In addition, stated anxiety sxs were best 
controlled on neurontin, thorazine, seroquel.  
- Due to concerns of polypharmacy in the setting of two prior 
overdoses, we initially held the patient's Depakote, Neurontin, 
Thorazine, and continued Seroquel 150 mg bid. 
- Started mirtazapine 30 mg qhs for anxiety and depression, 
however, pt continued to c/o severe anxiety symptoms. Eventually 
added Luvox that was tapered up to 150 mg qhs as well as 
thorazine 75 mg tid and 175 mg qhs, Neurontin 600 mg tid, and 
atenolol that was tapered to 50 mg po qd with careful monitoring 
of BP and HR. 
- Pt expressed concern that she would not be able to receive 
thorazine as an outpatient, so d/c'ed thorazine and started 
perphenazine 8mg tid, 16 qhs with significant improvement in 
anxiety symptoms.

of sobriety was during her pregnancies. However, no evidence of 
mania on this admission and no clear history of mania in the 
past. 
- The patient met diagnostic criteria for MDD, but has been 
abusing alcohol to control her anxiety symptoms. To target 
depressive and anxiety symptoms, we started mirtazapine and 
Luvox. 
- Held lithium and depakote therapy, particularly considering 
the hx of recent SA per overdosing.

.
ACTIVE ISSUES
.
# Fevers, bacteremia: Pt presented with fevers and rigors, N/V/D 
x 2 weeks. He was initially treated with gentamicin and then 
vanc and then zosyn at ___ over this time on multiple 
admissions, as described in the HPI. Blood cultures grew gram 
negative bacilli, later speciated as E coli.  His tunneled 
catheter was thought to be the most likely source and it was 
removed on ___ at ___. He was then transferred to ___ for 
further work-up and new line placement. He was started 
empirically on zosyn and switched to ceftriaxone when speciation 
from ___ returned as E. coli sensitive to ceftriaxone and 
ceftazidime. He does have a significant history of bacteremic 
infections, including lumbar osteomyelitis and bacterial 
endocarditis (unclear which valve, ?aortic) in ___ thought to 
be related to the peritoneal dialysis he was receiving at the 
time. Recurrence of these infections was considered as a 
possibility, especially given the fact that he endorsed lower 
back pain and had a III/VI systolic murmur. But he endorsed that 
his back pain is chronic, his murmur was noted in a transplant 
note from ___, and he had no other endocarditis stigmata, so 
these were thought to be less likely. It also was considered 
whether his painful joints could be infectious, but they were 
not warm, had minimal if any effusions, and he said that these 
joints are this painful at baseline. He was afebrile throughout 
his admission and blood cultures were consistently negative. He 
was switched on the day of discharge to ceftazidime 1g IV to be 
given at dialysis for 2 weeks. He will need follow-up at the 
___ clinic to monitor for signs of recurrent infection.  No 
TTE was obtained, given extremely low suspicion for 
endocarditis, however can consider doing this in the future to 
assess the cause of his prominent systolic murmur.
.
# ESRD: Pt was dialyzed on the day of admission, ___. His 
tunneled catheter was then removed at ___ on ___ and he was 
transferred to ___. Renal was consulted and they recommended 
that ___ place a new tunneled catheter for HD access. This was 
placed on ___ and he dialyzed immediately following placement. 
He is slated to have an eventual brachiobasilic fistula created 
with Dr. ___ the transplant service, who are following him 
longitudinally. He has a follow-up appointment with them 
scheduled for ___. His dialysis is coordinated by the prison on 
a MWF schedule and he will followup with the clinic there for 
his next dialysis session on ___.  Sevelamer was continued but 
at an increased dose.
.
# Joint pains:  Patient presented with L knee, ankle, big toe, 
and low back which have been worse over the past ___ months, but 
he apparently has had them for years. He has been treated for 
gout for years (though rheum at the prison has seen him and 
doubts gout). He attributes these current pains to gout. We were 
unable to attain original documentation of how the gout was 
diagnosed from the prison but he was treated for a flare as 
recently ___ with prednisone, ___, and allopurinol. There 
also was a question for septic arthritis or lumbar osteomyelitis 
given his bacteremia and fevers and PMHx of lumbar 
osteomyelitis, however his exam was not particularly impressive 
and this chronic time course would be unusual. He was maintaned 
on renally-dosed allopurinol (w HD) and his pain was controlled 
with oxycodone 5 mg q4 prn in house (for more reliable nonrenal 
clearance). He will followup with the prison clinic regarding 
the management of chronic joint pain. He was discharged on 
MScontin.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
.
# Hepatitis C: He has a history of chronic hep C with prior 
interferon treatment.He is not currently being treated. He 
presented to ___ with a mild transaminitis. It was unclear if 
this was acute from sepsis or evidence of evolving cirrhosis. He 
will follow up with the prison clinic regarding his chronic hep 
C. 
.
# Hypertension: Pt has baseline hypertension controlled with a 
home regimen. He was normotensive throughout his admission. Pt 
was restarted on home regimen but renal recommended stopping 
lisinopril, so it was discontinued on discharge.   
.
# Anemia: This is secondary to chronic renal disease, remained 
stable throughout admission.

___ TEE: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color 
Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal 
(LVEF>55%). There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic 
aorta at 35 cm. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The 
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. No masses or 
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen. No mass or vegetation is seen on the 
mitral valve. Mild (1+)ecentric mitral regurgitation is seen. No 
masses or vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but 
cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. There 
is no pericardial effusion. Impression: no vegetations seen  

___ Head CT w/o contrast: No hemorrhage, large territorial 
infarction, edema, mass, or shift of normally midline structures 
is present. Periventricular hyperdensities in the bilateral 
frontal lobes may represent acute infarcts or dilated 
___ spaces. The ventricles and sulci are normal in 
size and appearance. The basal cisterns are widely patent. 
Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated. 
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. 

___ CT T and L spine w/o contrast: 1. Destructive disc space 
changes at the L5-S1 disc space, endplate sclerosis and anterior 
osteophyte formation suggest that these are chronic changes from 
prior osteomyelitis. Comparison with prior imaging may be 
helpful. MRI is a more sensitive test for acute osteomyelitis. 
If the patient has a contraindication, a three-phased bone scan 
may be obtained.
___ CT pelvis w/ contrast: 1. The findings are in keeping 
with changes related chronic osteomyelitis/discitis at L5-S1. 
2. Grade 1 retrolisthesis of L5 on S1. 3. Moderate degenerative 
changes at the femoroacetabular joints. 4. No CT evidence of 
acute osteomyelitis or fracture. 
___ TTE: The left atrium is elongated. There is mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular 
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened (?#). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There 
are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. 
No vegetation seen (cannot definitively exclude).
___ ECG: Rate 78, Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation. Poor R 
wave progression, probably a normal variant. Non-specific ST-T 
wave changes, particularly in leads V4-V6. No previous tracing 
available for comparison.  
___ CXR: No acute intrathoracic process with an 8-mm nodule 
in the left base for with shallow obliques or non-emergent CT is 
recommended further evaluation.  
___ Xray pelvis: No fracture, dislocation, or definite 
radiographic evidence of acute steomyelitis, although please 
note evaluation of the inferior sacrum and coccyx is not 
optimal. If clinical concern is high, please note that MRI is 
more sensitive. 

 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Reason for Admission: low grade fever and chills at dialysis. 

___ yo M w/ h/o ESRD ___ to PCKD, on dialysis and recent 
admission for E. coli bacteremia who presented with chills and 
low grade fevers at dialysis session while on outpatient 
antibiotic (ceftazidime) regimen, now on vanc (___) and zosyn 
(___) with no growth in blood cultures to date. 
.
Active Issues:
# Low grade fevers- Patient was admitted for a temperature of 
99.8 at dialysis in the ___ week of treatment for e.coli 
bacteremia. Patient has been afebrile throughout admission and 
cultures drawn in the hospital had no growth.  Additionally 
cultures from ___ Dialysis unit from 
48hrs, 4 days and 7 days prior to admission had no growth.  
Because of this, it was felt that the patient's line could be 
left in place.  During admission, patient was treated with 
vancomycin (___) and zosyn (___). Patient had a history 
of osteomyelitis and endocarditis in ___, so these were 
evaluated with a TTE, TEE (requiring conscious sedation) and a 
CT spine which did not show evidence of current endocarditis or 
osteomyelitis. ID followed this patient throughout the admission 
and felt that given lack of fevers, negative blood blood 
cultures, and no obvious source, they felt he could go back to 
prison without antibiotics.
.  
# ESRD: Pt gets MWF dialysis, which was continued throughout the 
admission. Renal transplant service was made aware of patient's 
admission, as they are planning to create a brachiocephalic 
fistula for dialysis. Pt is on transplant list, transplant 
surgery elected to defer surgery while patient is being worked 
up for infection.  Continued home sevelamer, doxercalciferol and 
given lenient renal diet (per patient insistence) and was fluid 
restricted (1L/day). Patient will be seen by trasnplant shortly 
after discharge.
.  
# Joint pains: Pt w/ chronic pain of back, as well as L ankle 
and L great toe, which he attributes to gout. Patient remained 
on allopurinol during admission. Was not started on colchicine, 
and renal fellow recommended against this medication in ESRD 
patients. Ortho consult felt his back pain may be secondary to 
sacroiliitis. A pelvic xray did not show any fracture, 
dislocation, or acute osteo. A CT spine of his back did not show 
signs concerning for osteomyelitis either. Patient was continued 
on his home regimen of MS contin 30mg BID for chronic pain as 
well as started on NSAIDs for management of pain. Additonally 
complaining of locked DIP and PIP joints bilaterally, which was 
not actively assessed as an inpatient. Patient has outpatient 
follow up with orthopedic surgery.
.
# Hypertension: Patient's blood pressure ranged from the 
120s-140s in the hours after dialysis, to the 160s-190s in the 
day and a half leading up to the next dialysis session.  Patient 
c/o frequent HAs with elevated pressures and had an episode of 
vomitting with a BP of 177/90. During this time, pt had no 
papiledema or AMS. A CT head was negative for intracranial 
process and HA improved with hydralazine. Patient required 
several additional doses of hydralazine and lisinopril, and on 
the day prior to discharge, his standing lisinopril was 
increased from 5mg to 10mg PO daily with improved BPs 
(140s/80s). 
.  
Chronic Issues:
# Hepatitis C: Chronic hep C with prior interferon treatment. He 
is not currently being treated.  
- defer to outpatient management  
.  
# Anemia: Hct ranged from ___ throughout admission, baseline 
appears to be around 28. Secondary to chronic renal disease.  
Stable. Epo was held during admission for concern of possible 
history of parathyroid cancer. We were not able to locate 
records from his operation (only were able to determine from 
___ that it occurred in ___ in ___, 
___ prior to discharge.  After further discussion with 
nephrology, it was not felt that this distant and questionable 
history of cnacer should be a contraindication to epo so they 
were going to give instructions to resume epo in their sign-out 
to the patient's local hemodialysis center.
.  
# Lung nodule: 8 mm nodule in left base, new from prior studies. 
Will need follow up with non-emergent chest CT scan for further 
characterization as an outpatient.
.
Transitional Issues: Patient is incarcerated and gets his care 
at ___. Do not ___ any transitional issues.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital because you were having low 
grade fevers during your dialysis session.  You were being 
treated for a bacteria in your blood at your outpatient dialysis 
unit for the past 2 weeks, and so we were worried that the 
antibiotics you were on were not treating your infection.  While 
you were in the hospital, we gave you 2 strong antibiotics.  You 
did not have a fever in the hospital and we never found any 
bacteria growing in your blood.  The blood drawn at your 
dialysis unit also never had any bacteria growing in it. We did 
some imaging of your back and heart because we were concerned 
that you may have an infection in either of these areas, however 
there was no evidence of infection on these studies.  Because 
there is not evidence that you are still infected, we have 
stopped your antibiotics.  It is common to have low grade fevers 
while getting dialysis, so this may be a chronic event for you. 
If you remain afebrile over the next week (with a temperature 
not greater than 100.4F), you should be able to have a fistula 
or graft placed soon.  We have made an appointment with your 
transplant surgeon, Dr. ___, for next week (see 
details below), so that you will have close follow up and so the 
procedure will be done as soon as possible.

You were noted to have a lung nodule of unknown significance on 
CXR. You should follow up with your PCP and should be scheduled 
for an outpatient Chest CT to follow this.

Please continue your home medication as prescribed.  You no 
longer need to take Ceftazidime, the antibiotic you were getting 
at dialysis.

The following changes have been made to your medications:
- please INCREASE lisinopril to 10 mg daily
- please START ibuprofen 400 mg every 8 hours, if this isn't 
managing your pain, you can increase to 600 or 800 mg every 8 
hours.  Please be sure to take ibuprofen with food, do not take 
it on an empty stomach.
- please STOP taking ceftazidime.  There is no active evidence 
of infection, so you do not need any antibiotics right now.

The rest of your medications have not changed.  Please continue 
to take them as originally prescribed.

Chest X-Ray ___:
PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: Right-sided dual-lumen 
dialysis catheter tip terminates in the proximal right atrium, 
unchanged. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are 
within normal limits. The pulmonary vascularity is normal. 8-mm 
rim calcified nodular opacity within the left lung base appears 
unchanged. Lungs are clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax 
is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities. Multiple 
clips are seen in the right upper quadrant. Calcifications are 
noted in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, compatible with 
calcifications seen within innumerable left renal cysts on CT. 
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality, and no 
interval change from prior. 
.
MRI Lumbar spine without contrast ___:
Endplate erosion with loss of disc height at L5-S1 levels, with 
mild increased T2 signal, likely representing chronic discitis 
osteomyelitis. Additionally there is a disc bulge and bilateral 
facet arthrosis at this level causing moderate bilateral neural 
foramina narrowing and compression of the L5 nerve roots and 
abutting the S1 nerve roots. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old incarcerated male with ESRD secondary to Polycystic 
Kidney Disease on HemoDialysis with recent E. coli bacteremia 
diagnosed by Blood culture from outside hospital on ___ 
believed secondary to HD line infection, presented this time 
with fevers, chills/rigors, found to have 1 out of 4 bottle E 
coli bacteremia. He was stable and discharged on Bactrim for 1 
week. 
.
# Fevers: Patient admitted to ___ for the third time in the 
past month with fevers and rigors. Patient last had 
blood-culture proven E. coli bacteremia in ___. The 
source of infection is most likely the tunneled right-sided HD 
line, but blood cultures during this admission only grew E. coli 
in one bottle, so contamination of the sample by multiple 
hospital admission acquired skin flora cannot be ruled out and 
bacteremia cannot be ruled in. Patient's history is also 
significant for chronic osteomyelitis of his lumbar spine, but 
no acute infection was evident on MRI. Patient was initially 
treated wtih ceftazidime in the ED, broaded to 
vancomycin/cefepime, and after the culture returned GNR, 
narrowed to cefepime only. After speciation and sensitivity 
returned, and given question of bacteremia, patient was treated 
conservatively with Bactim DS once a day at evening for a total 
of 7 days without need for a line change at this time.
.  
# ESRD: He continued to receive MWF dialysis in-house. Renal 
transplant service and Transplant surgery were aware of pt on 
previous admission and were informed of current admission. 
Patient continued his home sevelamer, doxercalciferol, renal 
caps, and renal diet in-house.  
.  
# Chronic joint pains: Patient has chronic pain of back, knees 
and ankles which he attributes to gout. Previous ortho consult 
felt his back pain may be secondary to sacroiliitis, pelvic xray 
did not show any fracture, dislocation, or acute osteomyelitis, 
and CT spine did not show signs concerning for osteomyelitis 
either. Diagnosis of gout is questionable given chronicity of 
pains, location, and pain without signs consistent with acute 
gout flares. Rheumatology at the ___ has seen the patient and 
doubts gout. Have been unable to attain original documentation 
of how the gout was diagnosed, but pt was most recently treated 
for a flare in ___ with prednisone, ___, and 
allopurinol. MRI of lumbar spine was done this admission and 
showed signs of chronic osteomyelitis and bilateral neural 
foramina narrowing and compression of the L5 nerve roots and 
abutting the S1 nerve roots, likely the source of the pain. No 
evidence of acute osteomyelitis was seen. Patient's pain was 
controlled with his home regimen of MS contin and allopurinol.
.
# Hypertension: Controlled in house with home dose of lisinopril 
and metoprolol.
.
Transitional Issues:
1. Please follow up with pending blood cultures. 
2. Replacement of HD catheter once antibiotic course is 
complete.
3. Completion of bactrim course

WBC Tagged Scan/ Bone scan (___)- negative
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ M with ESRD on HD, HTN, chronic osteomyelitis and multiple 
admissions for fevers presenting with fever following HD.

# Fevers - Patient has had multiple admissions for transient 
fevers, often following HD, with blood cultures occasionally 
positive for E.coli.  Fevers only began once tunnel catheter was 
placed, after AVF clotted.  ESR and CRP are at patient's 
baseline so unlikely acute on chronic osteomyelitis.  In 
addition, patient had no worsening of his low back pain.  
Radiography showed stable process as well. CXR showed no acute 
cardiopulmonary process.  Patient given vancomycin/cefepime x1 
in ER.  Overnight on HD1/2 patient spiked fevers to 103.2 and on 
HD2, tunneled catheter line was pulled and patient was started 
on vancomycin and ceftazadime with dialysis. Patient was given a 
line holiday for 2 days prior to replacement of line.  Line tip 
culture grew strep viridans, coag negative staph, non hemolytic 
strep and corynebacterium consistent with skin or oral flora. 
Blood cultures were negative to date on the day of discharge.  
Patient was afebrile following removal of HD line and did not 
have further fevers.  He completed a 7 day course of vancomycin 
and cefepime following the discontinuation of the HD line.  
Other potential sources of occult infection were investigation 
with a CT abdomen, prostate ultrasound, WBC tagged scan and bone 
scan.  All of these studies were negative for infection.  

# ESRD on HD - Patient gets dialysis ___. 
He was continued on his home sevelamer, doxercalciferol and 
nephrocaps while inpatient. He was dialyzed on ___ 
prior to removal of original tunneled HD line, and spiked a 
fever to 105.  The line was removed following dialysis and 
patient had a ""line holiday"" until ___ when a 
new tunneled cath was placed without issue.  Patient was 
dialyzed on ___ and ___ as scheduled following 
replacement of catheter.  He had no fevers during or following 
dialysis.  Patient has follow-up scheduled with surgical team 
regarding AV fistula v graft.

# Leukopenia/Thrombocytopenia - Has had WBC as low as 2.8 back 
in ___, this appears to be the first time platelets have 
dipped so low. Patient recently on bactrim which ended 1.5 weeks 
ago, and working diagnosis was residual thrombocytopenia due 
this antibiotic.  In addition, with history of HepC, may be due 
to decreased liver function.  Platelets initially trended down, 
but were increasing above admission levels at the time of 
discharge.

# Chronic pain - Has chronic joint pains which have been 
associated with gout in the past. Also with history of chronic 
osteomyelitis as above.  Pain was at baseline and well 
controlled on home regimen of amitriptyline, MS contin 30mg BID, 
ropinirole.  
  
# Hypertension: Patient was intiially continued on lisinopril 
and metoprolol at home doses.  On HD 4, blood pressures were 
elevated, likely in the setting of volume overload due to 
dietary indiscretions and no HD over the weekend.  Patient was 
given hydralazine 25mg q6h, and following dialysis with removal 
of 4.5L, pressures remained elevated.  Lisinopril was increased 
to 40mg daily as well and patient was discharged on hydralazine 
and new dose of lisinopril.   Consider titrating off of 
hydralazine as full effect of lisinopril is seen.
  
# Hepatitis C: Chronic hep C with prior interferon treatment 
dc'ed for GI bleed and ineffectiveness. He is not currently 
being treated.  
  
# Anemia: On prior admission Hct ranged from ___ throughout 
admission, baseline appears to be around 28, secondary to 
chronic renal disease and possibly iron deficiency.  Hematocrit 
remained at baseline throughout admission.

# Transitional issues:
- Please titrate down and discontinue entirely if blood 
pressures well controlled on increased dose of lisinopril.
- 8-mm rim calcified nodular opacity within the left lung base 
noted on CXR, patient will need a non-emergent CT scan to better 
evaluate  
- Patient will have follow-up with surgical team regarding AV 
fistula/graft.  This should be done as soon as possible to avoid 
further tunneled line infections.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
It was a pleasure taking care of you during your recent 
admission to ___.

You were admitted because of a high fever following 
hemodialysis.  You have had frequent fevers following dialysis 
in the past due to bacteria in your blood.  Blood tests were 
drawn and you were monitored in the hospital for 24 hours.  You 
did not spike any more fevers, and your blood cultures remained 
negative.  The catheter tip grew some bacteria, and so you were 
continued on antibiotics.  In addition, you had an abdominal CAT 
scan to ensure there was no infection in your abdomen.  This 
exam was negative.

Your tunneled catheter line was replaced after a ""line holiday"" 
for two days.

Medication changes:
- INCREASE lisinopril to 40mg daily
- START hydralazine 25mg four times day, this should be tapered 
down and discontinued as your blood pressure responds to the 
increased dose of lisinopril

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with ESRD secondary to
Polycystic Kidney Disease, hypertension and HCV who is being
transferred from prison to ___ for renal transplantation. The
patient's HPI begins approximately ___ years ago when he started
hemodyalysis ___ failing kidneys from PKD. He has been on HD MWF
ever since. In ___, the patient claims that the people at the
___ encouraged him to enroll for a kidney. At this
time he also found out that he was HCV+. The patient claims he
does not know how he became HCV+, he thinks that it might have
been from all the dialysis. He denies ever using IV drugs.  In
___, he had a right nephrectomy for kidney stones. The patient
has had many AV grafts which he claims have now all failed. He
also notes that most of his medical admissions stem from
line/catheter related infections. Approximately 3weeks ago he 
was
admitted to the BI for a catheter related infection where he was
treated for ___ related infection with antibiotics. Since

Brief Hospital Course:
On ___, he underwent renal transplant from a HCV positive 
donor (recipient's HCV VL was 1,100,000 cop/ml on ___ 
right iliac fossa with neo ureterocystostomy over a ___ 
double-J stent with JP drain placed. Small amounts of urine were 
made immediately. Surgeon was Dr. ___. A peritoneal 
tear occurred during mobilization of the peritoneum during 
vascular exposure. Per report the kidney was decapsulated. A old 
stent was also removed from left forearm. Please refer to 
operative note for details. Postop, vital signs.   

Urine output was scant. IV hydration was given. Creatinine 
remained elevated. On postop day 1, potassium was elevated to 
7.0. He experienced delayed renal graft function (DGF). 
Hemodialysis was performed via the tunnelled right IJ line. 
Urine output was scant averaging 32-0cc/day. IV fluid was 
stopped and hemodialysis continued with last treatment on ___ 
for 2300ml. Weight was 75.5kg on ___.  

He was given a total of 4 doses of ATG, Cellcept and tapering 
doses of steroids per protocol until off (last dose ___. 
Prograf was started on postop day 0. Trough levels were low 
(goal 10)and dose was up titrated to 10mg bid on ___. 

Labs were notable for hct that trended down daily to 24 on 
___. Epogen was planned for dialysis days. 

He was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating independently 
(steady on feet)and RLQ incision was clean, dry and intact with 
staples. The JP drain output was high initially (720ml/day)and 
thus the drain remained in place. Output decreased to 115 ml by 
postop day 5. JP drain fluid was serosanguinous and creatinine 
of this fluid was 6.8 ruling out a urine leak (similar to 
serum). He did have a small amount of scrotal edema and was 
instructed to elevate scrotum on a towel. 

Left forearm incision was intact with staples without 
redness/drainage. 

He was discharged back to prison.

intake encouragement. Never had MS changes. Sodium was 133 on 
day of dsicharge. 

#. Renal txpt, AOCKD - The patient's Cr has been elevated since 
___ to 2.2 from a baseline ~1.8. No clear etiology and this

immunosupressives and taro level was at goal between ___. 
Urinalysis was unremarkable as was a renal ultrasound. Further 
follow-up as an outpatient is warranted. Continued on bactrim 
PPx. 

#. Hyperkalemia - The patient's potassium was elevated in house. 
Never had ECG changes. Switched to a low-K diet and Ace-I 
stopped. Potassium was 5.4 on day of discharge. 

#. Leukopenia - The patient had a mild leukopenia in house. 
Unclear etiology and resolved on its own prior to discharge. Was 
on azithro when admitted for a possible sinus infection, however 
had no infectious symptoms in-house and this was stopped.

acute onset abdominal pain and ___. 
 
ACTIVE ISSUES 
===========
# Abdominal Pain
# Diarrhea, bloody
Presented with sudden onset diffuse abdominal pain shortly after 
eating dinner. CT scan with duodenitis of unclear significance, 
and mild enlargement of the kidney with perinephric stranding. 
No evidence of obstruction, appendicitis. Ischemic colitis 
considered given bloody stools, but given chronicity of pain 
with repeated normal lactate, was thought less likely. 
Infectious diarrhea is most likely given
immunosuppression with no clear history or symptoms of 
inflammatory diarrhea and reportedly unremarkable recent 
endoscopic evaluation. Stool studies unrevealing and abdominal 
pain/diarrhea improved without intervention, likely etiology 
viral gastroenteritis. He received dilaudid and acetaminophen 
while in house, discharged without opioids. By discharge was 
tolerating regular diet.  Consider GI follow up as an outpatient
 
# ESRD s/p renal transplant:
# Hyperkalemia
He has had prior subacute antibody mediated rejection in ___, 
with DSAs to DQ7 and B18, treated with IVIG, steroids, 
rituximab, and change of immunosuppression from rapamycin to 
tacrolimus. Biopsy in ___ showed more chronic damage. He has 
had moderate proteinuria for some time now, likely due to 
transplant glomerulopathy. He did not have ___ as Cr was near 
recent baselines per transplant database. Renal transplant U/S x 
2 w/ stable elevated resistive indices compared to prior studies
but no fluid collections, hydro with no changes on close follow 
up scan. Renal biopsy was deferred. Discontinued losartan and 
Bactrim given persistent hyperkalemia and started sodium 
bicarbonate 1300mg BID, atovaquone for ppx. 
Discharge Immunosuppression
- tacrolimus 3mg Q12h
- mycophenolate myfortic 360mg PO BID
- prednisone 5mg PO daily
- atovaquone 1500 daily 
 
# HTN: presented with uncontrolled severe asymptomatic 
hypertension, improved with increased labetalol and with 
addition of nifedipine. Discharge regimen labetalol 400mg TID 
and nifedipine ER 30mg QD. Losartan was discontinued 

# Bone/mineral disease: continued home dose cinacalcet

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital for abdominal pain and 
diarrhea. You had a thorough evaluation including a CT scan and 
stool studies. The stool studies were reassuring. The CT scan 
showed duodenitis (inflammation of your small bowel). The most 
likely cause of your pain and diarrhea was a viral infection of 
you GI system. 

During your hospitalization, you immunosuppression for your 
kidney transplant was adjusted. You were started on a new 
medication called atovaquone to prevent infection, as well as a 
blood pressure medication called nifedipine. Please stop taking 
the Bactrim and losartan. 

Please follow up with your outpatient providers as below.

Wishing you well,

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ w/ ESRD s/p deceased donor renal 
transplant in ___ complicated by chronic allograft dysfunction 
(antibody-mediated rejection ___, biopsy-confirmed chronic 
transplant glomerulopathy, interstitial fibrosis & tubular 
atrophy ___, HTN, GERD, HCV s/p ledipasvir-sofosbuvir, & 
hyperparathyroidism s/p sub-total parathyroidectomy ___ who 
presented with increasing shortness of breath. 

# Dyspnea
# ?Acute CHF Exacerbation 
The patient presented with a history of orthopnea & dyspnea w/ 
CXR findings of bilateral effusions & pulmonary vascular 
congestion consistent with fluid overload state. His weight was 
noted to be higher recently from prior discharge. No medication 
non-adherence or dietary changes although the recent addition of 
sodium bicarbonate may be contributing due to increased Na load. 
Patient's blood pressures were uncontrolled & likely further 
increased his left-sided afterload. A TTE on ___ revealed 
elevated PCWP and E/E' with preserved EF. Overall patient 
reported symptomatic improvement with diuresis and his daily 
weights continued to trend down. Although there are no concerns 
of rejection based on a bland urine sediment and an unremarkable 
renal ultrasound, the etiology of the patient's volume overload 
may have been in part also been caused by worsening renal 
function as evidenced by creatinines in the 4s compared to his 
baseline of creatinine in the 3s. Patient was diuresed with IV 
furosemide PRN and transitioned to oral diuretics. His 
electrolytes are monitored and repleted as needed. His labetalol 
was increased to 600 mg 3 times daily and he was continued on 
his nifedipine 30 mg daily.

# ___:
# ESRD w/p transplant c/b chronic rejection:
Cr 4 on presentation, up from discharge 3.2 on ___. His elevated 
creatinine may be cardiorenal in etiology given clinical context 
and possible end-organ damage in setting of hypertension but 
worsening overall renal function cannot be ruled out given lack 
of significant improvement with diuresis. His renal US had no 
evidence/concern for hydronephrosis and there was less concern 
for rejection at this time given bland urine and lack of 
characteristics findings on renal US. The patient's renal 
function was trended daily. He was continued on his 
immunosuppressive regimen of mycophenolate, tacrolimus, and 
prednisone. His tacrolimus levels were trended daily. He was 
continued on atovaquone prophylaxis. His MAPs were maintained 
above 65. He is also continued on calcium and cinacalcet. Sodium 
bicarbonate was held in the setting of his volume overloaded 
state. His blood pressure was better controlled as noted.

# HTN:
The patient was noted to have systolic blood pressure readings 
in the ___. He was previously on losartan & labetalol last 
hospitalization but losartan was held on discharge given 
persistent hyperkalemia. At that time, labetalol dosing was 
increased to 400mg TID from 200mg BID & nifedipine ER 30mg QD 
was initiated. No evidence of renal artery stenosis in 
transplant kidney as though no changes in resistive indices. The 
patient's labetalol was increased to 600 mg 3 times daily and he 
was continued on nifedipine along leading to better blood 
pressure control.

# Mild Hyperkalemia:
Patient presented with mild hyperkalemia and on review of 
records, it appeared that patient was chronically mildly 
hyperkalemic. His hyperkalemia improved with ongoing IV diuresis 
with Furosemide. 

# Normocytic anemia:
His home hemoglobin was similar to baseline values in setting of 
end-stage renal disease. His CBCs were trended daily and he did 
not require a blood transfusion during his hospitalization.

# GERD:
Continued on his prior dose of ranitidine.

# Insomnia:
Continued on his prior dose of amitriptyline. His ramelteon was 
held due to concerns of possible toxicity to the renal 
transplant.

Findings equivocal for bilateral epididymitis.

___ Renal Transplant Ultrasound:
1. No hydronephrosis.
2. Normal intrarenal resistive indices, slightly decreased from 
prior.
3. Main renal artery and main renal vein are patent with 
appropriate
waveforms.
4. Unchanged 4 mm right lower pole renal lesion, possibly a 
small
angiomyolipoma.

___ Left Hip Xray:
No acute fracture.  There is mild degenerative changes of the 
hip, and partial ankylosis of the SI joints and degenerative 
discopathy and facet OA at L5/S1, that could potentially 
contribute to patient's symptoms.  If there remains high 
clinical suspicion for occult injury, further evaluation with CT 
is an option.

___ Second Opinon OSH CT Abd/pelvis:
1. No hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis of the right lower 
quadrant transplant kidney.
2. Improvement in perinephric stranding compared to prior study 
from ___.

___ CXR:
There is moderate pulmonary edema and layering bilateral pleural 
effusions. No pneumothorax.  The size of the cardiac silhouette 
is within normal limits.

___ TTE:
The left atrial volume index is mildly increased. The right 
atrium is mildly enlarged. There is no evidence for an atrial 
septal defect by 2D/color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with a normal cavity size. There is 
normal regional and global left ventricular systolic function. 
The visually estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is 
65%. There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract 
gradient. No ventricular septal defect is seen. Tissue Doppler 
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP 
greater than 18mmHg). Mildly dilated right ventricular cavity 
with normal free wall motion. The aortic sinus diameter is 
normal for gender with normal ascending aorta diameter for 
gender. The aortic arch diameter is normal. There is no evidence 
for an aortic arch coarctation. The aortic valve leaflets are 
moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve 
area 1.5-1.9 cm2). There is trace aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with no mitral valve 
prolapse. There is an eccentric, inferolateral directed jet of 
moderate [2+] mitral regurgitation. Due to acoustic shadowing, 
the severity of mitral regurgitation could be UNDERestimated. 
Due to the Coanda effect, the severity of mitral regurgitation 
could be UNDERestimated. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear 
structurally normal. There is mild [1+] tricuspid regurgitation. 
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There 
is a trivial pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
preserved biventricular systolic function. Increased left 
ventricular filling pressure. Mild aortic stenosis. Moderate 
mitral regurgitation. Mild tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate 
pulmonary hypertension.

___ MRI Left Hip w/o Contrast:
1. Mild degenerative changes of the left hip.  No findings to 
suggest 
infection or avascular necrosis. 
2. Chronic appearing tear of the anterosuperior aspect of the 
left acetabular labrum. 
3. Degenerative disc disease in the lower lumbar spine better 
evaluated on the dedicated lumbar spine MRI performed on the 
same date. 

___ MRI L Spine w/o Contrast:
1. L5-S1 loss of disc height, disc irregularity, endplate 
irregularities, and L5 loss of height are again demonstrated, 
suggesting either chronic 
spondyloarthropathy secondary to end-stage renal disease, versus 
sequela of prior discitis/osteomyelitis.  Also unchanged mild 
retrolisthesis and 
prominent epidural fat at this level.  Unchanged mild narrowing 
of the thecal sac and severe bilateral neural foraminal 
narrowing at this level. 
2. Mild spinal canal narrowing at L2-L3 and L3-L4 has progressed 
since ___. Moderate L3-L4 neural foraminal narrowing has 
slightly progressed on the right but is not significantly 
changed on the left. 
3. At L4-L5, moderate right and severe left neural foraminal 
narrowing, as 
well as mild, left greater than right subarticular zone 
narrowing, are not 
significantly changed. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o male with a history of ESRD ___ PCKD s/p 
deceased donor renal transplant (___) c/b chronic allograft 
dysfunction, now back on HD since ___, HCV s/p Harvoni, and 
HTN who presented with left flank/hip/testicular pain. 
Infectious work up was unremarkable. MRI spine was notable for 
degenerative disc disease, likely causing radicular pain. 
Chronic pain service and orthopedic surgery were consulted and 
recommended ongoing pain management. 

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
#Left flank/hip/back pain, severe uncontrolled pain
#Neuropathic pain
The patient presented with ___ weeks of left flank pain that 
then moved into his left hip, thigh, groin and left testicle. 
Initial evaluation was notable for CVA tenderness and left 
testicular tenderness concerning for UTI/nephrolithiasis vs 
epididymitis. CT abd/pelvis showed an atrophic kidney without 
nephrolithiasis or pyelonephritis and testicular ultrasound was 
equivocal for epidimyitis. He was initially started on broad 
spectrum antibiotics, which were discontinued after urine 
culture, GC & chlamydia returned negative. Given persistent 
pain, MRI L-spine and pelvis were done, demonstrating L5-S1 
changes c/w chronic spondyloarthropathy ___ ESRD vs sequela of 
prior discitis, as well as severe left-sided L4-L5 neural 
foraminal narrowing. The L4-L5 was felt to be the etiology of 
his pain given the correlating location. Chronic pain service 
and orthopedic surgery were consulted and provided recommends 
for pain management. He was continued on oxycodone, 
amitriptyline and started on tizanidine as well as lyrica with 
improvement in his pain. He will follow up in the ___ spine 
clinic for further management. 

#ESRD ___ PCKD s/p renal transplant c/b rejection now on HD
Presented with moderate volume overload, particularly noted to 
have bilateral pleural effusions on CXR. He underwent multiple 
daily sessions of dialysis with improvement and then was 
transitioned to his normal regimen. He had significant weight 
gain between sessions and required tighter fluid restriction, 
which should be continued as an outpatient. Additionally, his 
home prednisone and tacrolimus were continued.

#Acute hypoxic respiratory failure
#Acute pulmonary edema
Patient noted to have rapidly worsening hypoxia one evening 
during his hospitalization briefly requiring a non-rebreather. 
Repeat CXR showed significant pulmonary edema with bilateral 
effusions. He was started on a nitroglycerin gtt and underwent 
urgent bedside dialysis overnight with improvement in his 
clinical status. He was rapidly weaned to room air and remained 
stable for the remainder of the hospitalization. 

#NSTEMI
Troponin 0.08 on admission and continued to rise to 0.45 in the 
setting of fluid overload and acute hypoxic respiratory failure. 
EKG showed borderline submillimeter ST depressions in I, V5-V6 
(different from baseline), which was stable/improving on serial 
EKGs. He denied having any chest pain during this time. 
Cardiology was consulted and felt the presentation was 
consistent with type II NSTEMI due to fluid overload. Follow up 
TTE did not demonstrate a wall motion abnormality. Ultimately, 
cardiology decided against stress test at this time. He was 
discharged on his home aspirin with the addition of atorvastatin 
and metoprolol. 

#Atrial fibrillation 
Noted to be in atrial fibrillation on ___, which rapidly 
resolved within hours to a day. This was a new diagnosis for the 
patient, felt to be ___ fluid shifts vs less likely cardiac 
ischemia. TSH normal. His home labetalol was switched to 
metoprolol and his heart rate and rhythm remained stable. Given 
a CHADSVASC of 1, anticoagulation was not started.  

#Access
Newly placed fistula with some ulceration. He should follow up 
with Dr. ___ in Nephrology to evaluate as an outpatient. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
#Hypertension
He was continued on his home nifedipine. He refused several 
daily doses of labetalol, stating the dose was too high. Given 
new episode of atrial fibrillation, possible cardiac disease, 
and normotensive pressures without labetalol, he was switched to 
metoprolol and remained stable on this regimen.  

#Normocytic anemia 
Hemoglobin stable from prior, felt to be ___ anemia of chronic 
disease ___ ESRD
and iron deficiency. He was continued on his on iron 
supplementation. 

#GERD
- Continued ranitidine 

#BPH
- Continued tamsulosin

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[ ] Follow up in ___ Spine Clinic on ___ and with your 
primary care provider ___ ___ weeks 
[ ] Monitor pain, titrate medications as necessary, consider 
down-titrating back to oxycodone 10 mg TID if pain improves and 
able 
[ ] Monitor mental status on several sedating medications - 
consider stopping tizanidine in the future once pain improves 
given unclear benefit
[ ] Blood pressure regimen changed, follow up BP and titrate as 
necessary 
[ ] Developed one episode of atrial fibrillation, if future 
episodes occur, consider further discussion regarding 
anticoagulation 
[ ] Ensure the patient is adhering to a 1.5-2L fluid restriction 

[ ] Recommend follow up Echocardiogram in ___ years

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___!

Why you were admitted to the hospital:
- You were having pain in your side, back, hip and groin

What happened while you were here:
- Infectious work up was unremarkable - specifically you had no 
infection in your urine or testicles 
- There was concern for a kidney stone though imaging did not 
show this so it was felt to be less likely
- MRI of your back showed narrowing and pressure on the nerves, 
which was felt to be the cause of your pain 
- Orthopedic spine surgery and the pain service were consulted 
and assisted with pain management
- Additionally, you had significant fluid overload (fluid in 
your lungs), requiring oxygen and repeat dialysis sessions 
- Lab tests showed that there was additional stress on your 
heart. You should continue taking your heart medications as 
prescribed. 

What you should do once you leave the hospital:
- Please continue taking your medications as prescribed
- Please follow up at the appointments outlined below 

Sincerely,
Your ___ Care Team

Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
Hand and foot wounds
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is as ___ incarcerated male with ESRD
secondary to PCKD s/p failed kidney transplant in ___ and on HD
___, Hepatitis C (treated), HTN, hx of osteomyelitis/
endocarditis per chart review, and carotid stenosis who is
presenting with approximately 4 months of worsening bilateral
hand and unilateral foot pain swelling and skin breakdown. 

He reports no known antecedent trauma to his hands and his feet
but has had progressive pain and discoloration of two fingers on
his right hand, one finger on his left hand, and right big toe.
He reports trying to seek help earlier but was unable to get
medical attention at his ___ facility. The pain has
progressively gotten worse to now ___ pain, limiting his
ability to ambulate and use his hands.

Regarding his ulcers, per outpatient notes, Mr. ___ has a 
long
history of manipulative and self-injurious behavior. The wound 
on
the right hand started as a small cut likely from trimming his
finger nails. Without adequate wound care or dressing changes,
this progressed into a blister and then further progressed to 
the
necrotic lesion.

He had an ultrasound of the right subclavian to rule out 
thrombus
and an echo which showed no vegetations. ANCA panel and
cryoglobulins were negative. He had a period where the hand
became edematous and erythematous, with elevated ESR and CRP and
was treated with IV vanco and ceftaz with improvement in the
wound appearance, edema and erythema. Despite this, he continued
to be non-compliant with wound care.

He was seen by Vascular Surgery at ___ and on ___ an
arteriogram was done there showing:

The right subclavian artery axillary and brachial arteries were
all widely patent.  The right ulnar artery was the primary
outflow to the hand as the radial artery occluded in the distal
forearm.  On the left the subclavian axillary and brachial
arteries were all widely patent.  There was reversal of flow
distal to the fistula, the fistula filled very quickly.  With
fistula compression the ulnar artery had improved flow and was
the primary runoff to the hand as the radial artery occluded in
the mid forearm.  Of note, there was significant sluggish flow
throughout all of his vessels concerning for a possible central
source.

Dr. ___ performed the study, had no good explanation
for the very sluggish flow in this patient whose last EF was
normal. There were no treatable lesions as above.

Dr. ___, the transplant physician who has been managing his 
left upper extremity fistula, felt that ligating the fistula 
would be recommended in this setting to optimize flow to the 
left hand and help healing as much as possible, although patient 
has declined in the past. This may be an elective option in the 
future.

XR Bilateral Hands: ___
Loss of soft tissue at the tip of the right long finger, 
possibly
reflecting necrotic changes, with subtle loss of bone at the
terminal phalangeal tuft concerning for focal osteomyelitis. 
Left
hand grossly unremarkable.

XR Bilateral Feet: ___
No evidence of osteomyelitis or soft tissue gas. Soft tissue
swelling noted bilaterally slightly more pronounced on the right
than left. 

RLE US: ___
No evidence of DVT in the right lower extremity.

CXR: ___
1. No acute intrathoracic process. 
2. Dialysis catheter appears well positioned. 

TTE ___ 
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
normal cavity size and regional/global biventricular systolic 
function. Mild aortic stenosis. Moderate mitral regurgitation 
(may be UNDERestimated due to shadowing). No 2D 
echocardiographic evidence for endocarditis. If
clinically suggested, the absence of a discrete vegetation on 
echocardiography does not exclude the diagnosis of endocarditis. 
Compared with the prior TTE (images reviewed) of ___, the 
findings are similar.

MR ___ Hand ___
Limited study. Nonspecific marrow edema in the distal phalanges 
of the index, long, and ring fingers.  Although these findings 
could represent early osteomyelitis, given the patient's 
clinical presentation, the findings are more likely related to 
the patient's peripheral vascular disease. 

Lower extremity ABIs ___
Noncompressible distal vessels bilaterally with diminished toe 
pressures 
consistent with significant obstructive arterial disease. 
Doppler and pulse volume recordings consistent with tibial 
disease 
bilaterally, with significantly diminished left digit PVR.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o male with a history of ESRD ___ PCKD s/p 
deceased donor renal transplant (___) c/b chronic allograft 
dysfunction, now back on HD since ___, HCV s/p Harvoni, and 
HTN who presented with bilateral digital ulcers, with imaging 
concerning for possible osteomyelitis. Broad workup sent to rule 
out vasculitic process and embolic source. Presentation 
ultimately thought secondary to peripheral vascular disease with 
associated dry gangrene of the digits.

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS: 

# Foot/Hand ulcers
# Concern for osteomyelitis
Patient presented with worsening pain, swelling, and necrotic 
changes of the R index/middle and L index fingers in the setting 
of progressively worsening chronic hand ischemia. Duration seems 
likely ___ months, as not noted on prior admission discharged in 
___. Per outpatient notes, injury was apparently incurred and 
resulted in worsening appearance and apparent concern for 
superinfection which was treated with IV Vanc/Ceftaz at ___ 
additionally, reportedly ANCA and Cryoglobulins were sent and 
were negative. When not improved, patient was sent to ___ 
where arteriogram shows sluggish flow without evidence of a flow 
limiting lesion. This may be seen in the presence of a central 
lesion or can also be seen in advanced heart failure, however EF 
was noted to be preserved. Broad differential was considered for 
decreased perfusion and vasculopathy including peripheral 
arterial disease, embolic (hypercoagulability, infectious, 
central lesion) vasculitis(small/medium/large vessel 
involvement, cryoglobulinemia) with work up unrevealing. He also 
underwent CTA chest which did not show a central lesion in his 
aorta. He had ABIs of the lower extremities which showed 
significant vascular occlusive disease. Calciphylaxis was 
considered, dermatology was consulted but thought unlikely given 
isolated involvement of fingertips. For potential benefit of 
increased perfusion via vasodilation, nifedipine was uptitrated. 
Tacrolimus was discontinued after discussion with renal given 
limited benefit to graft and known side effect of 
vasoconstriction. Admission radiographs concerning for R digit 
osteomyelitis and as such MR was obtained which was not fully 
completed, but did not show osteomyelitis. Repeat MRI was not 
pursued as hand surgery did not think it would change 
management. Vascular surgery and hand surgery were consulted. 
Vascular surgery did not recommend intervention. Hand surgery 
felt his presentation was most likely consistent with dry 
gangrene related to his peripheral vascular disease and the 
fingers would likely self-demarcate/self-amputate. Pain was 
aggressively controlled with OxyCODONE (Immediate Release) 15 mg 
PO Q8H:PRN Pain on discharge. He was also started on gabapentin 
100 mg daily as adjuvant medication which discussed with the 
nephrology team.

#Atypical pneumonia
Found to incidentally have multifocal opacities on CTA chest per 
above. He was asymptomatic without leukocytosis, fever, cough. 
Differential diagnosis for the opacities included vasculitis 
given the above workup, however was ultimately felt to be most 
consistent with an atypical pneumonia. He received azithromycin 

#ESRD ___ PCKD s/p DDRT ___ c/b chronic allograft dysfunction 
(antibody-mediated rejection ___, biopsy-confirmed chronic 
transplant glomerulopathy, interstitial fibrosis & tubular 
atrophy ___ 
Patient maintained on HD ___ schedule for dialysis. Discharge 
weight was around
148lb on prior admission. On admission 140lbs. Discharge weight 
140.1 lbs.
- Continued home nephrocap daily, Mg oxide 800mg daily, Calcium
Carbonate 500 mg PO BID, and Cinacalcet 30 mg PO DAILY, EPO shot 
once weekly, renal diet, fluid restriction 1.5L daily. 
Tacrolimus was discontinued given limited benefit to graft and 
known side effect of vasoconstriction. 

# Immunosuppression
Continued prednisone 5mg daily. Prior to admission tacrolimus 
2.5mg BID which is vasoconstrictive, held after discussion with 
renal. Continued PCP ppx with ___ Suspension 750 mg PO 
DAILY. 

#Hypertension
Uptitrated nifedipine to 30 daily.

#Afib:
Labetolol switched to metoprolol succinate 50 daily last 
admission. Downtitrated metoprolol to 25 mg daily to decrase 
potential vasoconstriction.

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS: 
========================

#Normocytic anemia 
Hemoglobin stable from prior, felt to be ___ anemia of chronic 
disease ___ ESRD and iron deficiency. Continued ferrous 
gluconate 324mg BID.

# Left-sided L4-L5 neural foraminal narrowing
On past admission, patient presented with left flank/hip/back 
pain. MRI L-spine and pelvis were done, demonstrating L5-S1 
changes c/w chronic spondyloarthropathy ___ ESRD vs. sequela of 
prior discitis, as well as severe left-sided L4-L5 neural 
foraminal narrowing. Continued pain management: APAP 1000mg Q8h, 
amitriptyline 100mg QHS, lidocaine patch.

# GERD
Continued home ranitidine daily, simethicone for gas.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___.  During your hospitalization, you had surgery to 
remove unhealthy tissue on your lower extremity.  You tolerated 
the procedure well and are now ready to be discharged from the 
hospital.   Please follow the recommendations below to ensure a 
speedy and uneventful recovery.

LOWER  EXTREMITY AMPUTATION (bilateral first hallux) 
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS

ACTIVITY 

You should keep your amputation site elevated whenever 
possible.It is very important that you put WEIGHT BEAR FOR 
ESSENTIAL DISTANCES ONLY UNTIL YOU ARE SEEN IN FOLLOW UP. 

MEDICATION

Before you leave the hospital, you will be given a list of all 
the medicine you should take at home.  If a medication that you 
normally take is not on the list or a medication that you do not 
take is on the list please discuss it with the team!  

You will likely be prescribed narcotic pain medication on 
discharge which  can be very constipating.  If you take 
narcotics,  please also take a stool softener such as Colace.   
If constipation becomes a problem, your pharmacist can suggest 
an additional over the counter laxative. 

You should take Tylenol ___ every 6 hours, as needed for 
pain.  If this is not enough, take your prescription narcotic 
pain medication.  You should require less pain medication each 
day.  Do not take more than a daily total of 3000mg of Tylenol.  
Tylenol is used as an ingredient in some other over-the-counter 
and prescription medications.  Be aware of how much Tylenol you 
are taking in a day.

BATHING/SHOWERING: 
You may shower when you feel strong enough but no tub baths or 
pools until you have permission from your surgeon and the 
incision is fully healed.  DO NOT SOAK YOUR INCISION.
After your shower, gently dry the incision well.   Do not rub 
the area. 

WOUND CARE:
Please keep the wound clean and dry. It is very important that 
there is no pressure on the wound.    If there is no drainage, 
you may leave the incision open to air.  

Your staples/sutures will remain in for at least 3 weeks.  At 
your followup appointment, we will see if the incision has 
healed enough to remove the sutures. 

CALL THE OFFICE FOR: ___
Opening, bleeding or drainage or odor from your wound incision 

Redness, swelling or warmth in your wound.
Fever greater than 101 degrees, chills, or worsening 
incisional/wound pain  

NO OTHER PROVIDER, EXCEPT YOUR VASCULAR SURGEON, SHOULD 
DETERMINE IF YOUR SUTURES ARE READY TO BE REMOVED FROM YOUR 
WOUND!   
IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS, THE PROVIDER SHOULD CALL THE 
VASCULAR SURGERY OFFICE AT ___ TO DISCUSS.   THE 
SUTURES WILL BE REMOVED IN THE OFFICE AT YOUR FOLLOWUP 
APPOINTMENT WHEN IT IS DETERMINED BY THE VASCULAR SURGEON THAT 
THE WOUND HAS SUFFICIENTLY HEALED.

Conclusions  
Pre-Bypass:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous echo 
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or 
left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or 
color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately 
depressed (LVEF=35-40 %). Right ventricular chamber size and 
free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated 
at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The 
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic 
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. Significant 
aortic stenosis is present (not quantified). Moderate to severe 
(3+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet 
is eccentric, directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet. The 
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Torn mitral 
chordae are present. An eccentric jet of Moderate to severe (3+) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. 
Dr. ___ was notified in person of the results on ___ at 
0830.

Post-Bypass:
The patient is in SR on a milrinone, epinephrine, and 
phenylepphrine infusion s/p AVR, mitral ring, and ascending 
aorta repair. 
Left ventricular function is improved in the setting of 
ionotropic support with an estimated EF 45%. The septum is 
hypokinetic with mild dyskinesis. 
There is a well seated bioprosthetic aortic valve. There are no 
perivalular leaks. The peak and mean gradients are 36/14mmHg at 
a CO of 6.5.
There is a well seated mitral annuloplasty ring.. The mitral 
regurgitation is significantly improved - now trace. Peak and 
mean gradients are ___ mmHg at a CO of 6.5.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the 
operating room on ___ where the patient underwent AVR (25mm 
tissue), MVrepair (32mm ring), and Ascending Aorta Replacement 
(28mm gelweave graft) with Dr. ___.  Overall the patient 
tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was 
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and 
invasive monitoring. POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert 
and oriented and breathing comfortably.  The patient was 
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic 
or vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the 
patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The 
patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further 
recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued 
without complication.  Free water was restricted for mild 
hyponatremia, which improved prior to discharge.  He had a brief 
episode of rapid Atrial Fibrillation, which converted to SR with 
IV lopressor and titration of Atenolol. 
The patient complained of nausea and ""wretching"".  SLP evaluated 
the patient and he passed the swallow study without difficulty.  
The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for 
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge 
on POD 5 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was 
healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The 
patient was discharged to ___ in good condition with 
appropriate follow up instructions.

FINDINGS: Two views were obtained of the chest.  Improved small 
right and 
unchanged moderate left pleural effusions are accompanied by 
basal 
atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  Moderate 
cardiomegaly is mildly decreased from previous examination with 
intact sternotomy wires and valvuloplasty ring noted. 
IMPRESSION: Decrease in size of small right and unchanged 
moderate left  
pleural effusion with accompanying bibasilar atelectasis. 

pCXR ___
Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison 
to ___.  Cardiomegaly is severe, unchanged.  Left 
retrocardiac consolidation and pleural effusion are unchanged.  
Lungs are essentially clear at the upper and mid portions.  No 
pneumothorax is demonstrated.

___ TTE 
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is 
markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left The left atrium 
is moderately dilated. The right atrium is markedly dilated. 
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal 
cavity size. There is moderate to severe global left ventricular 
hypokinesis (LVEF = 25 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the 
left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased 
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right 
ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild global free wall 
hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus 
level. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The 
aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet 
motion and transvalvular gradients. A mitral valve annuloplasty 
ring is present. The mitral annular ring appears well seated 
with normal gradient. An eccentric, jet of mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure is high normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal 
cavity size and global hypokinesis Normal functioning aortic 
valve bioprosthesis and mitral valve repair. Dilated aortic 
sinus.

 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ s/p recent surgical AVR, MV repair and asending aorta 
replacement discharged on high dose furosemide now admitted with 
hypovolemia, hypotension and afib with RVR not responsive to 
metoprolol, but rate controlled with atenolol and sotalol.

# Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular 
response: 
High dose Metoprolol 100 mg po TID was ineffective at rate 
control. So was started on atenolol 50 mg po BID and sotalol. 
His QTc stayed 440-470 on sotalol. He had brief episodes of HR 
dropping to the ___ due to concealed PACs. Atenolol was 
decreased to 25 mg po BID.

Patient started on warfarin this admission, received nutrition 
education for warfarin. INR will be followed by Dr. ___.

# Arrythmia: concealed PACs which blocked at AV node and sinus 
giving bradycardia. Dose of atenolol decreased. Pt also had 2.2 
sec run of WCT (6 beats, CL 400ms). No Sx. Will follow with Dr. 
___.

# Hyponatremia: Most likely from daily furosemide use vs 
hypovolemic hyponatremia as improved with IVF and improvement of 
hypotension, but then downtrended slightly with increased dose 
of furosemide.

# Leukocytosis: Noted to have WBC 17K at rehabilitation, which 
continued to downtrend until normal this admission without 
antibiotics. Urine cultures and chest xray as well as blood 
cultures were unrevealing. No diarrhea noted to suggest c. diff. 
Surgical incision without signs of infection.  

# CHF: He was not volume overloaded at admission. In fact, he 
was dehydrated due to increase in dose of diuretics at rehab in 
the week prior to admission. CHF and decline in LV systolic 
function was indication to replace AVR. Dry weight at discharge 
is 157 lbs. Attention to whether he needs diuretic and at what 
dose will be done as outpatient as he resolves ___ space pleural 
fluid in the post-op course. Systolic blood pressures were in 
the ___ this admission, so ACEI or spironolactone were not 
added to regimen.

# Cough: Most likely viral URI with post nasal drip causing 
cough, but also possibly from GERD, atelectasis, or URI. Given 
prolonged sx and constellation of symptoms, did not suspect 
influenza. CXR showed left post surgical pleural effusion and 
bibasilar atelectasis. Patient was afebrile throughout admission 
and leukocytosis resolved without intervention. He was treated 
with benzonatate and guaifenesin cough syrup. 

# Recent cardiac surgery: Wound appeared clean and dry, no sign 
of infection, bypass access sites with healing ecchymosis  as 
well. Cardiac surgery made aware of admission, Mr. ___ has 
outpatient follow up with them. 

# GERD: continued PPI. There was a report of guaiac positive 
brown stool from rehabilitation center when he was not on 
warfarin. CBC was stable, no bloody or melanotic stools 
observed. Stool guiac near end of admission when he was on 
warfarin was negative for occult blood.

# Elevated TSH: ___ sick euthyroid picture gien recent cardiac 
surgery. Will have outpatient follow up after recovery from 
acute illness/recent surgery

# Nutrition: iron supplement

# Anxiety: lorazepam 0.5mg PO daily prn

# Insomnia: zolpidem 5mg QHS prn

# Rehab: HE was able to walk 60+ feet on level ground and climb 
1 flight of stairs. He should continue walking and stairs 
exercise at home.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
It was a pleasure caring for you during your hospitalization at 
___. You were admitted for a fast irregular heart rate (called 
atrial fibrillation) and low blood pressures. Your symptoms 
improved with medications to slow your heart rate down. To 
minimize your risk of complication(s) with this irregular rhythm 
you were started on a blood thinner called warfarin (or 
coumadin). This medicine requires regular requires frequent 
monitoring of a blood test called INR, which you will follow up

The patient is a ___ y/o F with a PMHx significant for Hep C c/b 
hepatocellular carcinoma (Childs A), hyperthyroidism who was 
recently admitted here for what is thought to be infectious 
colitis now presenting with ___.  

ACTIVE ISSUES
==============
# ___
Patient was recently admitted with infectious colitis and had 
normal renal function at that time.  She returned with ___ (Cr 
3.5) which was ultimately thought to be pre-renal in nature 
given her history of vomiting/poor PO intake and downtrending Cr 
with IVF.  On the day of discharge, her cr had downtrended to 
1.5.  Given that she has a history of hepatitic C, cryoglobulins 
were checked and were pending at the time of discharge, and 
subsequently returned negative. RF, checked as a marker for 
cryoglobulinemia, was WNL. Given significant improvement of Cr 
with hydration as well as resolution of nausea, vomiting, and 
diarrhea, pt was discharged with plans for Cr recheck within 5 
days of discharge. Hospital course and transitional issues 
including Cr f/u were discussed directly with covering PCP by 
telephone on the day of discharge.

# Nausea
Patient was admitted with complaint of two days of nausea with 
one episode of non-blood emesis.  Patient was given IV zofran 
and nausea/vomiting resolved over the course of her stay.  Given 
patient's report of leg weakness, her acute episode of 
hypertension, her past history of seizures and hyponatremia, as 
well as her intermittent nausea/vomiting/abdominal pain, if 
patient experiences another acute episode, testing for acute 
intermittent porphyria could be considered in outpatient 
setting.

# Black stools
Patient reported having ""black stools"" over the 24-hours prior 
to admission.  Hct upon admission was stable and HR was not 
elevated to suggest acute blood loss. She denied taking any iron 
or supplements which would turn her stool black. On discharge, 
patient reported that her stools were more formed compared to 
prior to admission, and were of normal brown color.  

# Elevated blood pressures
During prior admission, patient had elevated BPs to the 
systolics of 170s, she was asymptomatic at the time.  She was 
started on amlodipine 5mg PO daily but this was discontinued at 
her PCP appointment two days prior to admission given 
normotensive readings.  Upon admission patient's blood pressure 
was elevated to SBP 185 and she was reinitiated on amlodipine.  
On the day of discharge, patient was once again normotensive and 
amlodipine was discontinued. Markedly elevated BPs were likely 
associated with ___. She will followup with her PCP as an 
outpatient for further blood pressure monitoring.

CHRONIC ISSUES
================
#  Hyperthyroidism: Continued home dose propylthiouracil 
#  Hepatitis C c/b hepatocellular carcinoma: Thrombocytopenia 
and transaminitis at baseline.

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL SUMMARY
=====================
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with history of HCV s/p Harvoni c/b 
Childs A cirrhosis, history of prior hepatic lesion that 
spontaneously regressed on serial imaging, hyperthyroidism, and 
osteopenia who was transferred from ___ for continuity of care 
and biopsy. She initially presented to ___ with abdominal 
pain, nausea, and vomiting, where imaging showed a ~5cm liver 
lesion. She was then transferred to ___ where she had 
unsuccessful biopsy attempt, and therefore transferred to ___ for 
further workup and to see her regular providers. On arrival her 
symptoms had resolved. Radiology reread her images and 
recommended EUS-guided biopsy, lymphoma protocol (results 
pending). She had persistent hypertension after the biopsy that 
improved with medications. She also had tachycardia with 
exertion that improved with bolus of IVF. She was discharged 
with close follow up. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=================
[ ] We recommend the PCP follow up on the biopsy results. The 
oncology team here will also call the patient to schedule follow 
up when the biopsy results. 
[ ] Follow up on plasma metanephrine level and consider 24-hour 
urine metanephrine for further workup of possible 
pheochromocytoma if her symptoms persists
[ ] Will need EGD as follow up for cirrhosis management of 
variceal monitoring
[ ] If ___ has persistently poor appetite, consider starting 
mirtazapine QHS for appetite stimulation
[ ] Please titrate blood pressure medications as needed. 

# CONTACT: ___, Daughter, ___

MEDICATION CHANGES
==================
Increased lisinopril from 5mg daily to 20mg daily 
Started amlodipine 7.5mg daily for hypertension
Started marinol 2.5mg BID for appetite stimulation
Prescribing Zofran ODT for PRN use 

ACUTE ISSUES
===========
# Liver lesion with extension into portal vein 
At ___, CT torso showed heterogenous liver mass with invasion 
into the portal vein. An MRI showed a heterogenously enhancing 
mass predominantly intravascular in the main portal vein. ___ was 
unable to do the biopsy due to the location. GI was unable to 
collect tissue via EUS. Their plan was to consult surgical 
oncology for biopsy but after discussion with Dr. ___ was 
transferred to ___ for continuity of care. On arrival she 
reported her pain, nausea, and vomiting had resolved. CDs were 
obtained from ___ and ___ radiologists reread the films and 
recommended EUS. The ERCP fellow did a biopsy (results pending). 
___ had nausea and vomiting after the procedure that resolved 
with Zofran. 

# Hypertension
Well controlled on presentation. She reports she was recently 
diagnosed with hypertension but upon review of her atria's 
records it appears that she has been hypertensive in the clinic 
for several years and has declined antihypertensive medications. 
SBP 200s after procedure likely secondary to nausea, vomiting, 
and pain. However, hypertension persisted despite uptitration of 
medications. Workup for pheochromocytoma was initiated with 
plasma metanephrines because patient reported recent episodes of 
sweating. She was discharged on higher dose of lisinopril and 
amlodipine. 

# Tachycardia
#Orthostasis
Intermittent tachycardia after the biopsy worse with activity, 
not sustaining. Likely volume depleted in the setting of poor PO 
intake. We bolused her with fluids which improved her 
orthostasis.

# Nausea/Vomiting
Nausea and vomiting after biopsy likely secondary to MAC during 
the procedure. Resolved with zofran. 

# Anorexia
Patient reported poor appetite for several weeks, perhaps 
secondary to malignancy. We started marinol and nutrition was 
consulted who felt she met criteria for severe malnutrition. 

CHRONIC ISSUES
=============
# Cirrhosis
No evidence of decompensation. Childs A.

IMAGING
=========

RUQUS ___
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. Large, soft tissue lesion centered around the porta hepatis, 
with extension 
into the main portal vein, which does not demonstrate definite 
flow.  This is 
better assessed on the prior CT. 
2. Enlarged node adjacent to the pancreatic head, as seen on 
prior CT, 
measuring up to 3.5 cm. 
3. Moderate sludge within the gallbladder, without evidence of 
stones. 

MRCP ___
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. Redemonstration of a large mass centered with the porta 
hepatis which 
infiltrates and expands the main portal vein and the 
intrahepatic portal 
veins, not significantly changed compared with CT ___, 
but enlarged 
since  ___. 
2. No significant change in degree of mild to moderate 
intrahepatic biliary 
duct dilatation due to mass effect at the porta hepatis. 
3. Intrahepatic peribiliary enhancement, compatible with 
cholangitis.  No 
abscess. 
4. No evidence of cholecystitis. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with carcinoma of unknown 
primary, hepatobiliary in origin, HCV s/p Harvoni c/b Childs A 
cirrhosis, hyperthyroidism who presented with fever and RUQ pain 
c/f ascending cholangitis vs cholecystitis.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[] Patient on 7 day course of cefpedox/flagyl. Last day ___.
[] Discharge Hgb 9.9 on the day of discharge. Will follow-up on 
___ will cbc re-check.

ACUTE ISSUES
============
# Fever
# Leukocytosis
# Suspected cholangitis vs cholecystitis
She presented with fever, fatigue and abdominal pain. This was 
concerning for an infectious etiology, possibly cholangitis 
given her hx of ?hepatic carcinoma or cholecystitis. Fever could 
also be seen with cancer-associated thrombosis though there were 
no clear localizing signs to suggest this diagnosis. She had a 
leukocytosis to 12 which normalized by the time of discharge. 
She had a rising total bilirubin, which was thought to be iso 
intrahepatic biliary obstruction causing a possible infection. 
She was started on empiric ceftriaxone/flagyl. A RUQ US (___) 
showed a large soft-tissue ___ hepatis lesion extending 
into portal vein consistent with known malignancy. There were no 
signs of infection. An MRCP was then performed on ___ and showed 
intrahepatic peribiliary enhancement which was ""compatible with 
cholangitis"". By HD3 she was feeling better with no abdominal 
pain and she remained afebrile. She was transitioned to PO 
cefpedoxime/flagyl and discharged to finish a ___arcinoma of unknown primary
She had previously received FOLFOX C4D15 on ___. Due to 
persistent cytopenias and disease progression, the plan was to 
switch to new treatment at some point, possible lenvatinib. MRCP 
on ___ showed unchanged hepatic lesion with infiltration into 
the portal vein from prior CT on ___. She will have 
follow-up on ___ in ___ clinic. She was going to see 
Radiation Oncology on ___ but was unable to attend that 
appointment as she was hospitalized. She was seen by RadOnc 
during this hospitalization and will see them as an outpatient 
after discharge.

# Anemia
Pt was noted to have a down-trending hemoglobin to 9.9 (down 
from ___ on admission). Potentially there is an element of 
hemodilution however we have instructed the patient to have her 
labs checked on ___. Iron and B12 studies pending at the time of 
discharge. 

# Pain
She continued on her home oxycodone 5mg q4h PRN. Her abdominal 
pain improved during this admission.

# HTN
Her SBP was in the high 180s-190s upon admission in the setting 
of not being on her home anti-hypertensive and she remained 
asymptomatic. This was presumably in the setting of infection 
and pain. She continued on her lisinopril and amlodipine and her 
SBPs improved to 140s upon discharge.

# Osteoporosis
She continued on her weekly alendronate.

# Code status: Full presumed
# HCP: ___ (daughter) / p ___

This patient was prescribed, or continued on, an opioid pain 
medication at the time of discharge (please see the attached 
medication list for details). As part of our safe opioid 
prescribing process, all patients are provided with an opioid 
risks and treatment resource education sheet and encouraged to 
discuss this therapy with their outpatient providers to 
determine if opioid pain medication is still indicated.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. LEGAL & SAFETY:  
On admission, the patient signed a conditional voluntary 
agreement (Section 10 & 11) and remained on that level

having suicidal thoughts about the ""world being better off 
without me"" before getting into the ___ water, and that then 
the tide swept her away. Stated that she was very happy to have 
survived, but that she was struggling with guilt surrounding 
hurting her husband and child. Also expressed remorse 
surrounding the idea of losing custody of her child. She was 
accepting of care, and able to contract for safety while on the 
unit. Denied any acute suicidal ideation, intent, or plan. 
Stated that in the past the medication that had worked the best 
for her was Prozac. She was maintained on trazodone 50mg PO QHS 
for sleep.
During her stay, her home Paxil was downtitrated and Prozac was 
started and uptitrated. She was increased to Prozac 20mg PO QD. 
Additionally, she was started on Depakote for possible 
hypomania. She was increased to Depakote 500 mg QHS. She 
reported improvement in mood, as well as increased ability to 
cope with her circumstances. Patient and her family were very 
pleased and relieved to have a diagnosis of bipolar II disorder 
as they strongly believe her past problematic behavior is 
accurately explained by this condition. At the time of 
discharge, ___ was attending groups, was interactive in 
the milieu, and was able to participate in individual therapy. 

On discharge, patient reports ""better"" mood, has euthymic 
affect, and denies any suicidal thought, intent, or plan. She is 
future-oriented, with plan to attend intensive outpatient 
program and live at her parents' house before trying to go back

alcohol use. This resolved with conservative management in the 
ED. 

#) Hypothyroidism: Patient with TSH of 6.1 on admission to the 
inpatient unit. Her home Synthroid was increased to 50mcg PO QD. 
It is possible that hypothyroidism could have contributed in 
part to her mood episode.

5. PSYCHOSOCIAL
#) GROUPS/MILIEU:  
The patient was encouraged to participate in the various groups 
and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit.  The 
patients primary team met with her daily and various 
psychotherapeutic modalities were utilized during those times. 
She was increasingly able to engage in groups and therapy during 
her stay, as her mood and emotional lability improved. 

#) COLLATERAL CONTACTS & FAMILY INVOLVEMENT
A family meeting was held with the patient's mother, ___ 
___. The patient reported not wanting to be a part of 
this meeting, as she felt that it would agitate her further. 

#) INTERVENTIONS
- Medications: Prozac
- Psychotherapeutic Interventions: Individual, group, and milieu 
therapy.
- Coordination of aftercare: Intensive outpatient program

INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, 
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of 
starting this medication, and risks and benefits of possible 
alternatives, including not taking the medication, with this 
patient.   We discussed the patient's right to decide whether to 
take this medication as well as the importance of the patient's 
actively participating in the treatment and discussing any  
questions about medications with the treatment team, and I  
answered the patient's questions.  The patient appeared able to 
understand and consented to begin the medication.

RISK ASSESSMENT
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to herself and/or others based upon 
attempted suicide attempt by drowning in the ___. 
Their static factors noted at that time include history of 
suicide attempts, chronic mental illness, history of substance 
abuse, Caucasian race, age, marital status.  She also had 
several modifiable risk factors addressed at that time, 
including disorganized and unpredictable behavior, hopelessness, 
agitation, recklessness, social withdrawal, limited coping 
skills, no established outpatient treatment, and active 
substance abuse. We addressed these risk factors by restarting 
her on Prozac, holding a family meeting, and connecting her with 
outpatient treaters and an intensive outpatient program. 
Finally, the patient is being discharged with many protective 
risk factors, including help-seeking nature, future-oriented 
viewpoint, sense of responsibility to family, lack of suicidal 
ideation, and family support. Overall, based on the totality of 
our assessment at this time, the patient is not at an acutely 
elevated risk of self-harm nor danger to others. Our prognosis 
of this patient is fair, given the above.

Pertinent Results:
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  ___ 9:06 AM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: Assess size of ventricles 

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
___ year old woman with ___ evd clamped 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Assess size of ventricles 
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HEAD CT

HISTORY: ___ woman with subarachnoid hemorrhage with 
ventricular drain clamped, assess for change in size of 
ventricles.

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images of the head were obtained 
from the skull base to the vertex.

FINDINGS: Comparison is made to ___.

Again seen is a ventricular shunt via left frontal approach with 
tip of the catheter within the region of the right foramen of 
___. The ventricles are re-expanded bilaterally, and there has 
also been decrease in size of the right extra-axial fluid 
collection as well as improved edema of the right frontal and 
basal ganglial infarcts. Therefore, the increase in size of the 
ventricles likely is due to decreased mass effect with 
improvement in the subfalcine herniation as opposed to clamping 
of the ventricular shunt.

Again seen is a small hypodensity along the ventricular shunt 
tract involving the left frontal lobe as before.

The basal cisterns, especially the quadrigeminal plate and 
ambient cisterns are better visualized suggestive of improved 
edema.

Tiny amounts of pneumocephalus are again seen.

Coil pack is again seen within the anterior communicating artery 
aneurysm.

Post-surgical changes of the right scalp are again noted.

IMPRESSION: Since ___, decrease in size of right extra-axial 
collection and decreased edema of the right basal 
ganglia/frontal lobe infarct, with improvement in the subfalcine 
herniation and improvement in mass effect of the lateral 
ventricles.

The basal cisterns are better visualized suggestive of improved 
cerebral edema.

INDICATION: ___ female with possible inadvertent 
withdrawal of central venous line.

COMPARISON: ___.

SINGLE PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The right subclavian 
catheter has been pulled back and now resides projecting over 
the right subclavian vein. There is no pneumothorax. The 
cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable and unremarkable and the 
lungs are clear.

CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS  ___ 9:45 AM

CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS; CT BRAIN PERFUSION

Reason: ** CTA/CTP** as per Dr. ___ 
Contrast: OPTIRAY

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
___ year old woman with acom SAH, s/p clipping 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
** CTA/CTP** as per Dr. ___ 
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: ___ status post ACom clipping.

COMPARISON: CT perfusion ___.

TECHNIQUE: Continuous axial images of the brain were obtained 
before and following administration of 100 cc IV Optiray 
contrast. Multiplanar MIP and volume-rendered CTA reformats were 
displayed. Mean transit time blood flow and blood volume were 
assessed by dynamic imaging.

FINDINGS:

NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: ACom aneurysm clip with associated 
metallic artifact is noted. Again seen is a hypoattenuating area 
within the right temporal and inferior frontal lobe consistent 
with evolving infarct. There is also expanding and increasingly 
conspicuous hypoattenuation within the right basal caudate, 
putamen, and internal capsule consistent with new/progressive 
infarction of this region. High-density right extra-axial fluid 
collection with small locules of air is unchanged measuring 13 
mm in greatest diameter. There is slightly increased mass effect 
on the subjacent sulci and increasing transtentorial and 
subfalcine herniation with leftward midline shift of 8 mm, 
previously 7 mm. Left ventriculostomy catheter terminates within 
the left lateral ventricle at the midline and the ventricles are 
stable in size. There is worsening effacement of the suprasellar 
and ambient cisterns consistent with increasing mass effect. The 
13-mm subgaleal fluid collection overlying the right frontal 
craniotomy is stable.

CTA OF THE HEAD: The cervical portions of the carotid arteries, 
vertebral arteries, and basilar artery are patent. There is 
improved opacification in the circle of ___ and its major 
branches. Specifically, there is marked improvement of vasospasm 
involving the distal right M1 and right M2 segments of the MCA. 
There is improvement in vasospasm of the A1 segments bilaterally 
(right greater than left) though the right A1 segment still 
shows moderate vasospasm. The A2 segments bilaterally also 
demonstrate markedly improved caliber. The left MCA and its 
branches are unremarkable. The bilateral PCA arteries are also 
unremarkable.

CT PERFUSION: There is patchy perfusion abnormality with 
decreased blood volume in the bilateral temporal lobes and also 
right frontal lobe, which likely relate to vasospasm.

IMPRESSION:

1. New/progressive infarction within the right basal ganglia.

2. Increasing mass effect and transtentorial herniation with 
worsening effacement of the suprasellar and ambient cisterns.

3. Improving vasospasm within the right MCA, and bilateral A1 
and A2 segments of the ACA. There is, however, persistent 
moderate vasospasm within the A1 segments, in close proximty to 
the ACOM aneurysm clip.

TYPE OF STUDY: Left common carotid arteriogram, left internal 
carotid arteriogram, left vertebral arteriogram, right common 
carotid arteriogram, and right internal carotid arteriogram.

STAFF: Dr. ___.

FELLOW: Dr. ___.

Dr. ___ attending interventional neuroradiologist, was 
present and supervised throughout the procedure.

INDICATION: ___ female status post surgical clipping of 
an anterior communicating artery aneurysm, now post-operative 
day number seven. Rule out vasospasm.

COMPARISON: ___.

TECHNIQUE: Written informed consent was obtained from the 
patient's daughter after discussing the indications for the 
procedure, the risks of the procedure, and the alternative 
management. The discussed risks include stroke, loss of vision 
and/or speech which may be temporary or permanent, with possible 
treatment with stents and/or coils if needed. Additionally the 
indications, risks, and alternative management for possible 
intervention was explained.

The patient was brought to the interventional neuroradiology 
suite and placed on the biplane table in the supine position. 
Both groins were prepped and draped in the usual sterile 
fashion. A pre-procedure timeout was performed using two patient 
identifiers and verifying the procedure to be performed.

Access to the right common femoral artery was obtained using a 
19-gauge single-wall needle with 1% lidocaine mixed with sodium 
bicarbonate for local anesthetic. A 0.35 ___ wire was 
introduced through the needle, and the needle was removed. A 5 
___ vascular sheath was placed over the wire and connected to 
a saline infusion (mixed with heparin 500 units in 500 cc of 
saline) with a continuous drip. Through the sheath, a 4 ___ 
___ catheter was introduced and connected to a continuous 
saline infusion (mixed with heparin 1000 units in 1000 cc of 
saline). The following vessels were selectively catheterized, 
and arteriograms were performed from the following locations: 
Right common carotid artery, right internal carotid artery, left 
vertebral artery, left common carotid artery, and left internal 
carotid artery. After review of the study, the catheter and the 
sheath were withdrawn. Hemostasis was achieved using manual 
compression. The patient tolerated the procedure well without 
any immediate post-procedure complications.

FINDINGS:

RIGHT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY: The bifurcation is normal. There is 
no evidence of a vascular malformation.

RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: The cervical, petrous, cavernous, 
and supraclinoid segments of the internal carotid artery are 
normal. There is a surgical clip identified in the region of the 
anterior communicating artery with no residual aneurysm 
identified. There is mild stenosis of the M1 segment of the 
middle cerebral artery and moderate stenosis of the M2 middle 
cerebral artery branches. Additionally there is moderate 
stenosis of the A1 segment of the anterior cerebral artery with 
a focus of luminal irregularity in its proximal portion. There 
is decreased parenchymal phase blood flow identified within the 
right anterior watershed vascular distribution.

At this point, the decision was made for an intervention. 5 mg 
of verapamil was gently infused selectively into the right 
internal carotid artery over 1 minute. A right internal carotid 
artery angiogram was then repeated at approximately 10 minutes 
after the infusion of verapamil which demonstrated residual 
mild-to-moderate narrowing of the right A1 segment of the 
anterior cerebral artery, and right M1 and M2 segments of the 
middle cerebral artery.

LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY: The left vertebral artery and the left 
posterior inferior cerebellar artery appear unremarkable. There 
is no reflux identified into the right vertebral artery. The 
basilar artery appears unremarkable.

5 mg of verapamil was gently infused selectively into the left 
vertebral artery over ___AROTID ARTERY: The bifurcation is normal. There is 
no vascular malformation.

LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: The cervical, petrous, cavernous, 
and supraclinoid segments of the left internal carotid artery 
are normal. There is mild narrowing of the A1 segment of the 
left anterior cerebral artery. The left middle cerebral artery 
as well as its major branches appear unremarkable. A surgical 
clip is identified in the region of the anterior communicating 
artery with no residual aneurysm seen.

5 mg of verapamil was gently infused selectively into the left 
internal carotid artery over 1 minute. A post-infusion angiogram 
the left internal carotid artery demonstrates mild narrowing of 
the A1 segment of the anterior cerebral artery.

MODERATE SEDATION: 100 mcg of intravenous Fentanyl and 4 mg of 
intravenous Versed were administered in divided doses by a 
registered nurse, who was monitoring the patient throughout the 
2 hour and 15 minute intraservice time. Please refer to the 
nursing record for further detail.

IMPRESSION:
1. Status post surgical clipping of an anterior communicating 
aneurysm with no residual aneurysm identified.

2. Moderate narrowing of the right M1 and M2 segments of the 
middle cerebral artery and right A1 anterior cerebral artery, 
and mild narrowing of the left A1 segment of the anterior 
cerebral artery consistent with vasospasm. 5 mg of verapamil was 
selectively infused into the right internal carotid, left 
vertebral, and left internal carotid arteries for a total of 15 
mg of verapamil. Post- infusion angiogram demonstrated residual 
mild-to- moderate narrowing of the right M1 and M2 segments of 
the middle cerebral artery and right A1 segment of the anterior 
cerebral artery and residual mild narrowing of the A1 segment of 
the anterior cerebral artery.

# OSH ERCP (___): The major papilla was normal. The bile 
duct was deeply cannulated. Contrast was injected. I personally 
interpreted the bile duct images. Ductal flow of contrast was 
adequate. Imagequality was adequate. Contrast extended to the 
main bile duct. Contrast extended to the cystic duct. Contrast 
extended to  the hepatic ducts. A long cystic duct stump 
originated in the
lower third of the main bile duct. The lower third of the main 
bile duct contained one stone. The main bile duct was dilated. 
Biliary sphincterotomy was made with a traction (standard) 
sphincterotome using ___ electrocautery. There was no 
post-sphincterotomy bleeding. The biliary tree was swept with a 
11.5 mm balloon and basket starting at the bifurcation. Sludge 
was swept from the duct. A few stones were removed. Pus was 
coming out of the ampulla. One stone remained. The basket got 
stuck with the stone in the bile duct and the wire broke 
proximally instead of breaking around the stone. 
Post Procedure Diagnosis:
     - The major papilla appeared normal.
     - The patient has had a cholecystectomy.
     - The entire main bile duct was dilated.
     - Choledocholithiasis with a partial obstruction was found.
Partial removal was accomplished by biliary sphincterotomy; no 
stent was inserted. 
Complications: Unable to remove basket with one wire coming out 
of the mouth 
.
# OSH CT abd/pelvic (___): Mild diffuse thickening of the 
gastric  antrum, which can be seen in  the setting of gastritis. 
 2. Uterine fibroids. 

# ERCP (___): The scout film showed an impacted wire basket. The 
bile duct was deeply cannulated with the sphincterotome. 
Contrast was injected and there was brisk flow through the 
ducts. Contrast extended to the entire biliary tree. The wire 
basket was seen in the distal CBD. The left and right hepatic 
ducts and all intrahepatic branches were normal. To facilitate 
removal of the basket, a sphincteroplasty was made with a CRE 
balloon from 12 mm to 15 mm.  The biliary tree was then swept 
with a balloon above the impacted basket. The wire basket was 
removed from the patient. Stones were also extracted. A ___ x 5 
cm double pigtail stent was placed in the main duct. Excellent 
bile and contrast drainage was seen endoscopically and 
fluoroscopically

 
Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT & PLAN: ___ year old female with h/o DM, HTN, HLD, h/o 
gallstones s/p remote CCY in ___ who presents with 
n/v/abdominal pain/diarrhea/fevers found to have obstructive 
choledolithiasis and cholangitis s/p ERCP with removal of some 
stones but then the basket got stuck with the stone in the bile 
duct and the wire
broke proximally.
.
# OBSTRUCTIVE CHOLEDOLITHIASIS, CHOLANGITIS, RETAINED BASKET 
WIRE. Ms. ___ was admitted s/p ERCP (done at ___ 
Endoscopy) for cholangitis - however course was complicated by 
the retention of basket wire within the distal CBD.  She 
underwent ERCP here where sphincteroplasty was performed, basket 
wire was retrieved along with multiple CBD stones.  A CBD stent 
was placed to expedite clearance of any remaining stones/sludge. 

   She presented with leukocytosis, elevated LFTs, RUQ abd pain, 
pus from the CBD duct c/w cholangitis.  For this, she was 
treated with IV unasyn along with IV dilaudid and zofran PRN for 
pain/nausea control.  She did well after the ERCP procedure - 
and was able to tolerate a regular diet the same day.  She will 
need to complete 5 more day of ciprofloxacin and flagyl.  Due to 
loose stool and diarrhea (and recent iv antibiotics), the 
concern was for the possibility of C.diff.  Stool c.diff were 
sent - and extra doses of flagyl were prescribed in case the 
stool studies returned positive.  She should not take any 
aspirin, Plavix, NSAIDS, Coumadin for the following 5 days.  She 
will need a repeat ERCP 4 weeks for stent pull and 
re-evaluation. 

# GASTRITIS:  Ms. ___ had a positive H pylori test at OSH.  
Abd CT also revealed with diffuse thickening of the antrum 
consistent with gastritis.  A 14-day prescription of PPI, 
Clarithromycin and Amoxicilli was given for treatment of H. 
Pylori.  Since this is not urgent, she (through her daughter) 
understands that this need not be immediately treated and may be 
postponed until the cholangitis is fully treated (and prospect 
of C.diff is eliminated). 

# DIABETES MELLITUS - last Hgb A1C 6.5 not on medications at 
home.  She was placed on ISS here along with diabetic diet.

# HTN/HLD: HCTZ/toprol/lisinpril were continued.  Lipitor can be 
resumed on d/c.

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure looking after you, Ms. ___.  As you know, 
you underwent an ERCP here to retrieve the wire basket stuck in 
the common bile duct.  You tolerated the ERCP here well: the 
wire was removed along with the stones within the common bile 
duct.  A bile duct stent was also placed to ensure adequate 
passage of biliary stones.   
   Please complete 5 days of ciprofloxacin and flagyl 
(antibiotics) to treat the infection within the bile duct.  
Thereafter, you can start the other antibiotics (prilosec, 
amoxicillin, clarithromycin) to treat H.Pylori.  Since treatment 
of H.Pylori is not urgent, you may elect to delay the H.Pylori 
treatment until there is enough time to recover from the 
cholangitis and ensure that you are not infected with C.diff.  
We will contact you with the stool Cdiff results. 
   You will be contacted by our ERCP department to schedule a 
follow up ERCP to remove the stent.

Brief Hospital Course:
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
====================
[ ] Chest pain - unclear if of cardiac etiology or otherwise. If 
this is deemed to be of cardiac origin, initiation of a 
long-acting nitrate can be considered as blood pressures allow
[ ] Positive MIBI - patient should follow up with a cardiologist 
to decide whether elective cardiac catheterization is necessary 
following a recent MIBI with a small area of decreased perfusion 
that reversed with rest
[ ] Started on Aspirin - discussed w/ ___. Pt okay to be on 
ASA. Felt it has benefit for her primary prophylaxis in CAD. 

___ year old female with DMII, HTN, HLD, history of ICH w/ 
residual R-sided blindness and a recent stress MIBI suggestive 
of a small area of decrease perfusion that reversed with rest 
presented from her PCPs office with chest pain concerning for a 
coronary etiology.

ACTIVE PROBLEMS
================
# Chest Pain
The patient presented with chest pain that she described as 
""pressure"" in her neck. Given concern for coronary artery 
disease, troponins were checked (negative x3) and EKGs were 
obtained (no acute ischemic changes). A more robust history was 
elicited, which suggested that she feels this chest pain 
intermittently (no daily but several times per week) and has not 
noted any correlation with rest or exercise. She takes her 
sublingual nitroglycerin when she is feeling pain, which helps 
sometimes but not always. She also recalls some events that were 
relieved with rest and some that lasted for several hours. Based 
on this, it remains unclear if her chest pain is coronary in 
origin. She also had an echocardiogram that was unremarkable. 
Given the negative objective work up and the very questionable 
history of her chest pain, cardiac catheterization was deferred 
at this time. Her metoprolol succinate and lisinopril were 
continued, and she was started on 81mg aspirin daily (after 
consultation with neurosurgery). Consideration was made to 
initiate nitrate therapy, however he blood pressures remained 
too soft. This can be further considered in the outpatient 
setting.

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS
========================
# DMII - held metformin while inpatient and initiated Humalog 
sliding scale

# HTN - held HCTZ in favor of lisinopril and metoprolol

# HLD - continued atorvastatin

# Anxiety - continued Wellbutrin 100mg BID

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ F w/ PMHx of HTN, HLD, PVD, COPD, history 
of rectal cancer, and anemia who presented from cardiology 
clinic with symptoms of dizziness in setting of new onset atrial 
fibrillation found to have over-repletion of thyroid hormone, 
hospital course complicated by acute pulmonary edema.  

# Acute Pulmonary Edema: Early on the morning of ___, the 
patient woke up acutely short of breath and hypertensive to 
systolics of 200. A chest x-ray showed worsened pulmonary edema 
in RLL. She was treated with 40mg IV Lasix and a nitroglycerin 
drip. She required BiPAP and was transferred to the CCU where 
she was treated with 3 additional doses of 40mg IV lasix over 
the course of 2 days. She only required BiPAP for 6 hours, and 
was then weaned to nasal cannula oxygen supplementation. 
Nitroglycerin drip was weaned off and home dose amlodipine was 
restarted. Review of the TTE showed 3+ MR ___ etiology thought 
to be possible flail mitral valve leaflet) as the presumed 
cauase for the patient's acute pulmonary edema. The patient 
continued to received IV furosemide on the floor with 
improvement in oxygen requirement with the patient on RA on the 
day of discharge. The patient was transitioned to PO torsemide 
___. The patient was started on losartan for after load 
reduction as well as metoprolol. Weight on day of discharge: 
47.7kg.

# Atrial fibrillation: CHADS-2 score of 2; patient has never had 
a stroke or TIA in the past. Patient was rate controlled on 
metoprolol XL 100mg and converted to sinus rhythm on the morning 
of ___. Thyroid function testing revealed over repletion which 
may have been the etiology for new afib. Levothyroxine dose was 
decreased to 112mcg daily (from 135mcg). TFTs should be repeated 
in 6 weeks for discharge from ___ on this new dose. 
Anticoagulation was discussed with the patient's outpatient 
providers (Cardiology and Primary care physician); given the 
patient's history of falls, the decision was made to use full 
strength aspirin for anticoagulation.  Patient's metoprolol was 
decreased to 50mg metoprolol XL in light of development of acute 
pulmonary edema. 

# Pyuria: Early during admission, patient had UA suggestive of 
UTI with 49 WBC and few bacteria. Urine culture with less than 
10,000 organisms. Patient received 3 days of ciprofloxacin.  

# MRSA cystitis: Patient had Foley catheter placed during 
admission while being digressed. The patient's UA was suggestive 
of UTI but patient without white count when debris noted in the 
Foley catheter. Foley was discontinued. Urine culture showed 
MRSA, and patient complained of symptoms of dysuria. 
Sensitivities showed that MRSA was sensitive to Bactrim DS BID; 
patient was started on Bactrim ___. Blood cultures 
pending; repeat urine culture at time of discharge pending. Plan 
for 7 day course of Bactrim DS BID with day one being ___.

# PVD: ASA 325mg PO daily. The patient was started on 
pravastatin, which she should continue as an outpatient.
 
# HTN: The patient's home amlodipine was discontinued during 
this admission, while metoprolol was started and adjusted. With 
the development of acute pulmonary edema (see discussion above), 
metoprolol was decreased and ___ (losartan) was started for 
afterload reduction. ___ as opposed to ACEi was started given 
the patient's underlying cough.
 
# Hypothyroidism: TSH 0.091, FT4 2.1, consistent with 
over-repletion. Decreased levothyroxine from 135mcg daily to 
112mcg daily. Recheck TFTs in 6 weeks from discharge from acute 
hosptialization and adjust dose appropriately.
 
# Anemia: CBC stable through admission. Continued home iron 
supplementation. Patient due for B12 injection per daughter 
which she received during this admission. 

# COPD: Continued home tiotropium, Symbicort and albuterol.

# Thoracic spine area skin breakdown: Patient with Mepilex 
placed. Trending exam. Encourage ambulation. 

# CODE STATUS: FULL CODE. There had been discussion with patient 
regarding her code status. She had expressed desire to be 
DNR/DNI though patient's daughter had much difficulty accepting 
this code status. On-going discussions regarding code status 
will need to be carried out upon discharge from hospital.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old pleasant lady who presents with history of 
worsening cough and shortness of breath on exersion as well as 
urinary frequency. The patient was previous prescribed 
levofloxacin and Z-pack prior to admission. However one day 
before admission her symptoms became worse prompting her to see 
her PCP who referred her to the ED. 

# UTI: Her admission labs were notable for a UA suggesting a UTI 
and an elevated Cr to 1.8. She was started on PO Cipro for a 
presumed UTI. First urine culture returned negative but pt still 
reported urinary sx so a second urine culture was sent and is 
pending at time of discharge. She completed a 5-day course of 
Cipro while in-house and her Cr improved with IV fluids. 
Discharge Cr was 1.1.   

# COPD exacerbation: pt's wheezing thought most likely to be 
COPD exacerbation. Her CXR excluded pneumonia, and her blood 
culture excluded sepsis. Since the patient recently finished a 
course of azithromycin prior to admission she was only started 
on a prednisone taper. She was discharged on a prolonged taper 
as discussed with her outpatient pulmonologist Dr. ___. 

# constipation: pt was put on bowel regimen including 
senna/Colace, lactulose, psyllium when she reported she had not 
had ostomy output for 5 days. She typically has ostomy output 
every 3 days. She will continue on senna/Colace in the 
outpatient setting. 

# urinary retention: pt was found to have persistently have high 
post-void residuals and required straight cathing. This was 
thought to be a chronic issue based on her history of UTIs and 
pyuria. She should be bladder scanned in rehab and will follow 
up with urology in the outpatient setting to discuss further 
workup. 

CHRONIC ISSUES: 

# anemia: hemoglobin trended down mildly but remained close to 
pt's baseline. Anemia is believed to be a combination of iron 
deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease. She received a 
unit of pRBCs for a  Hgb of 7.3, but should follow up with her 
primary care doctor about reinitiating EPO. 

# diastolic CHF: the most recent echo in ___ showed EF >55% 
and LVH with moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation. The 
pt did not have s/s of CHF exacerbation in house. She was 
restarted on her torsemide at a reduced dose of 10 mg twice 
weekly. 

# anxiety: pt was discontinued from lorazepam and did not 
require treatment for anxiety

# HLD: continued home pravastatin 

# HTN: continued home metoprolol 

# hypothyroidism: continued home SYnthroid. TSH here was 3.2. 

# ostomy care: wound consult was placed for concern for sores 
around the ostomy site. The pt reports that in the past she has 
received chromalin spray that was helpful for addressing the 
sores. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUE:
=========================
- steroid taper: prednisone 40 mg for a total of 5 days then 
transition to prednisone 20 mg for another 5 days. Pt should 
continue on 30mg/day for 3 days, 20mg/day for 3 days, then 
10mg/day for 3 days, then 5mg/day for 3 days and follow up with 
Dr. ___. 
- Torsemide dose on discharge: 10 mg. Pt should take torsemide 
twice weekly as needed. 
- urine culture: pt has urine culture from ___ pending at time 
of discharge. Please follow this up. 
- urinary retention: pt found to have persistently elevated 
post-void residuals and required straight cathing. She seems to 
have h/o chronic urinary retention. She should follow up with 
urology for question of cystoscopy. She should get bladder scans 
TID and be straight cathed for PVR >500 at rehab. 
- EPO injections: pt found to have anemia of chronic disease and 
started on iron, B12 and folate supplements. Per discussion with 
pt, she should follow up with PCP to discuss whether to continue 
EPO injections for her anemia (she hasn't received any in about 
___ years). She did receive 1 U pRBCs while inpatient. 
- medication changes: consider discontinuing donepezil as pt 
does not appear to have dementia as she has relatively high 
functional status (able to use phone, engage appropriately in 
conversation etc). Pt's lorazepam was d/c'ed as she did not 
require it in house.

prednisone), valvular heart disease (3+ MR/2+TR per ___ TTE), 
and atrial fibrillation, remote h/o colorectal ca s/p ostomy, 
suprapubic catheter, presenting with malaise x 4 days, and new 
onset chest pain and dyspnea. 

The patient is interviewed with her daughter at bedside. They 
reports that her symptoms started four to five days prior to 
presenatation with general feeling of unwell, and significant 
cough. Sought assessment at ___ in ___. CXR reportedly 
without e/o of pneumonia. Given chronic azithro and negative 
radiographic findings, no escalation of antibiotics. Per NP 
note, HR noted to be 120+; dig added, no changes to patient's 
metoprolol. Symptoms persisted and worsened through the weekend. 
Patient and daughter state they were not able to go in for 
reassessment during the weekend d/t the holiday. Endorses 
increased sputum production, and characterizes the color and 
green; denies sinus pain. Endorses sick contacts at her nursing 
home. Has been using Duonebs at home QID, with some initial 
improvement of her symptoms, but then became more resistant. 
Denied objective fevers. Treated with UTI last week with unknown 
antibiotic. 

Was prompted to come into the ED because of escalating shortness 
of breath and chest discomfort. Patient denies chest discomfort 
for my interview, but per the ED, she had characterized the cp 
as bilateral chest pressure. 

In the ED, initial vitals were:   97.9 122  167/90  98% nc 
Exam notable for HR140, irregular. bibasilar crackles 
Labs showed hyponatremia 118 --> 120, K 6.9 (3.8 on recheck); Cr 
1.2 (baseline Cr 1.0-1.1); Dig: 0.7; anemia 86/18; grossly 
positive U/A 
Imaging showed  Mild cardiomegaly, mild pulmonary vascular 
congestion, no frank pulmonary edema. Small bilateral pleural 
effusions with patchy bibasilar opacities
Received IV diltizaem 15, oral diltizem 30, IV levofloxacin 750 
mg, furosemide 20 IV. 
Transfer VS were  97.8  78  130/71  17  95% RA  

Decision was made to admit to medicine for further management.  

On arrival, patient endorses the above. Breathing has improved. 
Dtr reports new per-istomal wounds since ___, but has not 
reevaled them since then. Patient endorses pain around ostomy 
site. Endorses suprapubic leakage but no pain; endorses some 
feeling of discomfort and urgency given the bulb in the 
catheter. States that were schedule to have it replaced by 
Urology this week.  Denies back pain. Denies diarrhea. Denies 
weight gain, rather states she has had 30lb weight loss for 
several months, and keeps losing weight. Dtr endorses poor oral 
intake. 

At 0200, patient complained of L mid axillary line chest 
discomfort at ~10th rib, not reproduced with palpation; pt 
denied sob, diaphoresis, nausea, although dtr state that she saw 
the patient have increased effort of breathing and wheezing. EKG 
without change from prior.

Imaging:
========
___ CXR:
Mild cardiomegaly, as seen previously, with mild pulmonary 
vascular 
congestion, but no frank pulmonary edema.  Small bilateral 
pleural effusions with patchy bibasilar opacities, potentially 
atelectasis, but infection or aspiration is not excluded in the 
correct clinical setting.

___ CT Head:
1. No acute intracranial abnormalities. 
2. Global parenchymal volume loss and sequela of chronic small 
vessel ischemic disease.

___ TTE:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Diastolic function could 
not be assessed. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, 
ascending and arch levels are normal. The number of aortic valve 
leaflets cannot be determined. There is no aortic valve 
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the 
eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be 
significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). Moderate to severe 
[3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least 
moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to 
a very high right atrial pressure.] There is no pericardial 
effusion. 

IMPRESSION: 
1) Normal biventricular regional/global systolic function.
2) At least moderate mitral regurgitation (difficult to assess 
due to Coanda effect) due to possibly partial anterior mitral 
valve leaflet flail.
3) Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation with normal RV 
size/function in setting of at least mild elevation of RV 
afterload.

___ CXR:
Small left pleural effusion has increased.  Increased left 
basilar opacity, may represent atelectasis or developing 
pneumonia.

___ KUB:
IMPRESSION: 
1. No abnormally dilated loops of small or large bowel to 
suggest obstruction. 
2. Enteric tube terminates in stable position in the expected 
position of the stomach body. 

___ CXR:
IMPRESSION:    
COMPARED TO CHEST RADIOGRAPHS SINCE ___, MOST RECENTLY 
___. 
  
LUNGS ARE CLEAR ON ___.  ON ___ BIBASILAR 
OPACIFICATION HAD DEVELOPED ALONG WITH AN INCREASE IN SMALL 
BILATERAL PLEURAL EFFUSIONS. CONSOLIDATIONS IMPROVED ON ___, BUT SUBSEQUENTLY FIRST CONSOLIDATION IN THE LEFT LOWER LOBE 
AND NOW IN THE RIGHT LOWER LOBE HAD DEVELOPED, PROBABLY 
PNEUMONIA.  THERE IS NO PULMONARY EDEMA.  PLEURAL EFFUSIONS 
REMAIN SMALL.

valvular heart disease (3+ MR/2+TR per ___ TTE), and atrial 
fibrillation, remote h/o colorectal cancer s/p ostomy, and 
suprapubic catheter, who presented with malaise x 4 days, 
hyponatremia, and new onset cough and dyspnea, thought to be 
secondary to pulmonary edema as well as pneumonia. Hospital 
course complicated by epigastric pain/ileus thought to be 
secondary to initiation of diltiazem, which improved, and new 
pneumonia noted on CXR prior to discharge.

# Dyspnea:
# Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: presented with worsening 
dyspnea. Also endorsed orthopnea, and BNP > 11,000 (previously 
1800 one year ago). CXR with mild opacities, possible 
atelectasis vs. aspiration vs. infection as well as pulmonary 
vascular congestion. TTE did not reveal any new systolic 
dysfunction. Overall her dyspnea was thought to be secondary to 
mild fluid overload, aspiration, and possibly URI/mild 
pneumonia. She was initially treated broadly with vanc and 
levofloxacin 750 mg PO Q48H. Vancomycin was discontinued given 
negative MRSA swab and she completed a 5 day course of 
levofloxacin finishing on ___. She was diuresed with IV Lasix 
boluses 20mg BID until she developed an increase in her 
creatinine. Home torsemide was re-intiated at same dose as 
prior, and patient appeared euvolemic at time of discharge. 2 
days prior to discharge, new area of likely pneumonia seen on 
CXR. Patient without fever, and good O2 sat on RA. Started 
ceftriaxone, transitioned to cefpodoxime for total ___nding ___ (see transitional issues below).
- Discharge Cr: 0.9
- Discharge weight: 39.3 kg (bed weight, may not be accurate)

# Fever: 100.7 on ___. CXR revealed likely atelectasis but 
could not rule out infection. Blood cultures were sent and were 
no growth at time of discharge. She had a grossly positive UA, 
expected given suprapubic catheter. Urine culture with no growth 
and no GU symptoms at time of discharge.

# Epigastric pain / Illeus: Patient developed significant 
abdominal pain and distension requiring NG tube placement 4 days 
prior to discharge, with improvement in symptoms after 
suctioning. Thought to be secondary to initiation of diltiazem, 
and diltiazem was d/c'ed and metoprolol reinitiated (see below). 
Epigastric pain improved and patient was drinking adequately, 
and drinking small amounts prior to discharge.

# Atrial fibrillation: RVR on arrival, improved with diltiazem 
IV and then PO diltiazem. The timing of diltiazem initiation 
coincided with GI symptoms (per above) and so this was stopped, 
and metoprolol was restarted at a higher dose with good effect, 
and HR was in the ___ to low 100s. She had recently been started 
on digoxin at urgent care. This was initially stopped but then 
restarted due to difficulty controlling rates during 
hospitalization.

# Hyponatremia: presented with serum Na of 118. Urine Na was 116 
prior to Lasix, likely SIADH. Patient reports recently 
increasing her free water intake which may explain acute onset. 
Na normalized with free water restriction.
 
# Chest pain: troponins negative x 4, poor historian. EKG was 
without ischemic changes. Likely musculoskeletal/epigastric 
pain.

# COPD: Gold stage II on chronic azithromycin. No wheezing on 
exam without evidence of active COPD exacerbation. Continued 
home tiotropium bromide 1 cap daily, ipratroprium-albuterol neb 
Q6H, and albuterol nebs prn. Home symbicort was non formulary 
and she was treated with inhaled fluticasone. 

# Ostomy: patient with peristomal raised lesions. Seen by 
colorectal surgery who recommended dermatology consult to rule 
out malignancy. They felt that this was not urgent andcould be 
done as outpatient. ___ require treatment with steroids

Transitional Issues:
====================
- INCREASED metoprolol succinate to 100mg in setting of afib w 
RVR. Initially changed to diltiazem but d/c'ed diltiazem due to 
abd symptoms (see above) 
- STARTED digoxin 0.25mg
- Patient noted to aspirate on speech and swallow evaluation. 
Should take only thickened liquids
- Please check video swallow once patient fully stable as 
outpatient, per recommendation of speech and swallow
- Discharged on 1.5L fluid restriction - hyponatremic on 
admission with Na of 118. Urine lytes consistent with SIADH. 
- CONTINUE home dose of torsemide 
- Please coordinate non-urgent dermatology evaluation for 
periostomal ulcers, may need steroid treatment
- RECHECK TSH as an outpatient. Borderline low on admission at 
0.32, consider decreasing dose of levothyroxine as outpatient 
given RVR on presentation (although more likely secondary to 
volume overload)
- STARTED cefpodoxime day for 5 days (first day ___, last day 
___
- HELD azithromycin (chronic UTI suppression) given on 
cefpodoxime and given its interaction with donepezil. Consider 
restarting. Please check EKG prior for QTc monitoring

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking part in your care while you were in the 
hospital. You were admitted because you were feeling short of 
breath. You were found to have a low sodium level, but this 
rapidly improved. You were given IV medication to remove fluid 
from around the lungs. You were also given antibiotics for a 
mild pneumonia. During the hospitalization, your heart rates 
increased, requiring adjustment of your medications as listed 
below. Your metoprolol dose was increased, and a drug, digoxin, 
was started. You also were noted to have abdominal pain and 
distension, and a nasogastric tube was placed to decompress your 
stomach, and improved your discomfort. At that time, a 
medication, diltiazem was stopped, as it was thought to be 
contributing to your stomach discomfort.

You likely developed a new mild pneumonia, and were treated 
first with and IV antibiotic, and one to take by mouth at the 
rehab. Your breathing was good without the need for additional 
oxygen at the time of your discharge from the hospital. Your 
abdominal discomfort improved as well.

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO AFTER LEAVING THE HOSPITAL:
1. Do not drink more than 1.5 liters of fluid a day
2. Drink only thickened liquids

Again, it has been a pleasure taking part in your care, and we 
wish you the best.

- Your ___ care team

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure treating you for flu and pneumonia. When you 
arrived at ___, you tested positive for the flu which was 
causing a fever as well as some confusion and tiredness. Your 
initial chest x-ray showed improvement of your prior pneumonia. 
While being treated for the flu and dehydration with Tamiflu and 
IV fluids, you developed a new pneumonia that was seen on a 
second chest x-ray and required antibiotics and fluids. Due to 
decreased oral intake of food and beverage, you developed 
elevated levels of sodium in your blood, which improved after 
you were given IV fluids.

Please weigh yourself every morning, and call your doctor if 
your weight goes up more than 3 lbs. Please continue to take all 
your regular medications, and follow up at any appointments that 
are scheduled. 

Again, it has been a pleasure taking part in your care, and we 
wish you the best.

sober, and future oriented (w/ plan to engage in outpatient 
substance abuse treatment, be sober for her mother), and 
connected with outpt treatment (sp. medication compliant and 
connected w outpt treaters) and therefore not at any significant 
elevated acute risk at this time to warrant inpatient 
hospitalization.

Imaging/Studies:
___ CT A/P with Contrast
1. No evidence of colitis, pancreatitis, our other acute 
intra-abdominal 
process. 
2. Chronic findings, including one liver and multiple renal 
hypodensities, too small for further characterization. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ year old M with PMH of CAD s/p 4V CABG 
and asthma and recent admission for colitis who presented with 4 
weeks of epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting.

Active Issues: 

# Abdominal Pain
Patient has past admission to ___ in ___ for similar symptoms, 
and workup was unrevealing. Given his history of colitis, 
gastritis and PUD were suspected. Infectious etiologies such as 
gastroenteritis were deemed less likely as he had been 
symptomatic for 4 weeks and had no risk factors such as travel, 
camping, or new foods. His lipase and LFTs were normal, so 
pancreatitis, hepatitis, or biliary pathology were thought to be 
unlikely. In addition, his abdominal CT was unrevealing. 
Finally, 2 serial troponins were <.01, and there was isolated T 
wave inversion in V2, so cardiac etiology not likely. He had no 
electrolyte abnormalities or weight loss, so he had been able to 
maintain adequate nutritional intake as an outpatient. He 
reported no known history of peptic ulcers, and H. pylori IgG 
was negative. He received Maalox, diphenhydramine, and lidocaine 
as well as Tylenol PRN pain, which helped alleviate his 
symptoms. He was continued on omperazole 40mg BID and placed on 
a full liquid diet, which he was able to advance slowly, with 
LUQ pain after eating but no vomiting.

# Chronic right upper extremity pain
This pain was thought to be neurogenic as patient laid on that 
arm for hours during his ___ suicide attempt. He had been 
asking his PCP to take him off of narcotics and agreed to 
transition to gabapentin. His hydrocodone-acetaminophen was 
discontinued and he was started on gabapentin 100mg TID, to be 
uptitrated as an outpatient.  

Chronic Issues:

# Coronary Artery Disease
s/p 4v CABG in ___. His EKG was unconcerning and there was no 
rise is serial troponin levels x 2. He continued on ASA 81mg 
daily and metoprolol 100mg BID. He had said upon admission that 
he was worried about taking ASA because he thought it might harm 
his stomach, but was reassured that he should stay on this 
medication.  

# Asthma
He had wheezing in the ED, but resolved after nebs--his wheezing 
was present once he arrived on the floor, for which he received 
albuterol nebs.  

# Depression/Anxiety
History of suicide attempt in ___. No SI. He was continued on 
sertraline, trazodone, and clonazepam BID PRN. He reported being 
in a depressed mood.  

Transitional Issues:

# Follow up on H Pylori serology (lab result pending at 
discharge). 
# Consider food allergy testing, although he did not report 
symptoms with one specific food.
# Consider GI referral as an outpatient, as he has had similar 
symptoms in the past, including an admission in ___, 
without clear cause. 
# Patient wanted to stop Vicodin. He was started instead on 
low-dose gabapentin for right arm pain. Please ___ 
response as an outpatient, consider uptitration. 
# Unclear why patient not on aspirin with history of coronary 
artery disease. Consider starting if indicated.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___.

You were admitted for abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. You 
received medications to help with these symptoms. Meanwhile, 
your blood tests and vital signs (like blood pressure) showed 
that you have been receiving adequate amounts of fluids and 
nutrition through the foods and liquids you drink. You had a CT 
scan which showed no cause for your symptoms. In addition, we 
were reassured that you were able to eat lunch without any 
problems. Therefore, it is safe for you to return home and you 
can complete other tests or procedures as an outpatient.  

It is likely that your pain is from inflammation in the stomach, 
called gastritis. This can be treated with medications you are 
on (omeprazole). Your symptoms could also be from ulcers in the 
stomach. We tested you for an bacteria called H. pylori which 
can cause ulcers, but the blood tests will not be back until the 
end of the week. We and your primary doctor can ___ on 
this. This can be treated (if you have it) with a short course 
of antibiotics. 

We recommend continuing on the Maalox and liquid lidocaine if 
needed to control your symptoms. Please follow up with your 
primary care doctor after discharge. 

We wish you a safe and healthy return home.

Sincerely,
Your ___ Team

currently taking pepto-bismol. No evidence of colitis, 
pancreaitis, or diverticulitis. Given NSAID use, prior PUD, 
post-prandial pain, and epigastric location peptic ulcer disease 
is most likely etiology, but could also represent NSAID 
gastritis. Patient felt maalox made him feel worse. Stopped 
cipro/flagyl on admission since no evidence of colitis; diarrhea 
improved. tTG negative. Treated here with IV PPI initially, 
transitioned back to home PO. Added sucralfate. Tolerated normal 
diet.  he did not provide sample for h. pylori serology.

History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ woman with PMH of ___ disease, 
blindness, hypertension, history of bronchitis and reactive 
airway disease who presents today with several weeks of 
recurrent episodes of shortness of breath, anxiety, and gasping 
for air.
She was in her usual state of health until several weeks ago, 
when she began to have 2 or more episodes per day that her son 
describes as ""choking"" and she states that she feels like she 
has trouble breathing. When queried about whether there is 
coughing, the son states that the patient was at ___ 
___, and has been evaluated for aspiration; she is on a 
precautionary diet for this already. These episodes are not 
characterized by coughing. Rather, the patient becomes acutely 
short of breath unrelated to any obvious aggravating factor; he 
provides nebs and Maalox and tries to calm her down, and she 
seems to slowly improve over one hour. Of note, the son does 
have videos that show the patient's symptoms. She feels like she 
is in distress, with shortness of breath. She is also had mild 
nausea during the last week and on day of presentation which 
patient states is new. She presented to ___ yesterday 
for this problem; she had an unremarkable EKG by report. Per 
___, the son, they are seeing an outpatient GI specialist as 
well, and she had a CT scan done which showed patency of the 
esophagus and no obstruction that could be causing these 
episodes. H. Pylori negative. There is an outpatient endoscopy 
pending by Dr. ___ at ___ to further evaluate the 
problem that has not yet occurred. However, her son describes 
being concerned about her breathing, and worrying that he does 
not know what to do for her and wanted to rule out cardiac 
causes as well.
To note, she was taking prednisone 10 mg daily at home per her 
son's report.

Imaging/Procedures
=====================
___ CXR
FINDINGS:  
Patient's chin obscures visualization of the lung apices.  There 
is no 
visualized consolidation, effusion, or edema.  The 
cardiomediastinal 
silhouette is stable.  Tortuosity of the thoracic aorta is again 
noted.  
Chronic deformity of the proximal left humerus suggests remote 
prior fracture. 
Old healed anterior right rib fractures are also noted.  No 
acute osseous 
abnormalities. 
  
IMPRESSION:   
No acute cardiopulmonary process. 

___ CXR
FINDINGS:  
Lung volume is low.  No consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural 
effusion is identified.  Mildly enlarged cardiomediastinal 
silhouette is unchanged.  Left humeral deformity is unchanged 
and is likely sequela of old fracture. 
  
IMPRESSION:    
No radiographic evidence of pneumonia. 

___ Video Oropharyngeal swallow study
FINDINGS:  
The study was limited due to the patient's body habitus and 
inability to relax shoulders.  Barium passes freely through the 
oropharynx without evident aspiration.  There was significant 
esophageal retention, which did not resolve with further 
swallowing attempts. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
Significant esophageal retention of barium.  This is likely 
related to severe esophageal dysmotility, if further evaluation 
is desired, a full esophogram can be performed. 
  
___ EGD
Findings:
 
Esophagus:  

 Lumen: A medium size hiatal hernia was seen.  

 Other presbyesophagus throughout the esophagus   

Stomach:  

Mucosa: Diffuse atrophic appearing mucosa of the mucosa with no 
bleeding was noted in the stomach. These findings are compatible 
with likely atrophic gastritis.  

Duodenum: Normal duodenum. 

Impression: 
- Presbyesophagus throughout the esophagus
- Atrophic appearing mucosa in the stomach compatible with 
likely atrophic gastritis 
- Medium hiatal hernia
- Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

Summary
=========
___ year old female with history of ___ disease, 
bilateral blindness, hypertension, history of bronchitis and 
reactive airway disease brought to the ED by her son with 
several weeks of recurrent episodes of shortness of breath, 
anxiety, and gasping for air. Patient was evaluated with video 
swallow study which showed esophageal dysmotility and esophageal 
retention of barium. Follow-up EGD was done which showed 
presbyesophagus. Patient was monitored with baseline diet of 
ground solids with thin liquids with medications whole with 
pureed solids. She tolerated the diet well and was discharged 
home

========================================
Acute medical/surgical issues addressed
========================================
# Esophageal dysmotility and esophageal retention of barium on
video swallow:
Patient presented with periordic episodes of shortness of breath 
and anxiety. Suspected that symptoms likely caused by esophageal 
reflux causing her to aspirate which exacerbates her reactive 
airway disease. Certainly ___ puts patient at risk for 
swallowing issues at baseline. Outpatient CT scan did not show 
any obvious esophageal obstruction. No current concern for 
infection given no leukocytosis, evidence on CXR of PNA, and pt 
has no fevers, productive cough. Breathing remained stable on 
room air and O2 sats >90%. Both GERD and reactive airway disease 
treatment were optimized at home and this continued here. Video 
swallow ___ revealed significant esophageal retention of 
barium concerning for severe esophageal dysmotility. GI 
consulted and recommended EGD ___ to evaluate for esophageal 
ring or other structural issue that could be causing retention. 
EGD revealed presbyesophagus and atrophic gastritis. Patient was 
advised to adhere to astrict aspiration precautions at home 
including eating more frequent, smaller meals, taking small 
bites and sips, sitting upright for all meals and medication 
administration and remain sitting upright for 1 hour after 
meals. Please eat only if awake, alert, and attentive.

# Reactive Airway Disease
Patient presented with episodes of SOB and anxiety that may 
represent asthma exacerbations from suspected aspirations. 
Breathing remained stable on room air and O2 sats >90%. 
Optimized reactive airway disease treatment is optimized at home 
with fluticasone IH BID, ipratropium bromide neb q6hs, 
levalbuterol neb q6hours, Perforomist IH BID, and prednisone 
10mg PO daily. While admitted patient was treated with duonebs 
q6hrs, advair BID, and prednisone 10mg daily. At discharge, 
patient was restarted on her home medications.

floridly positive UA and urine culture growing E. coli. Patient 
was not oriented this AM but also received Ativan in the ED last 
night. Completed Bactrim DS BID (D1: ___. 

# Hypertension: not taking metoprolol as outpatient. Will need 
to verify medication list with son. ___ pressure well 
controlled overnight and SBP 150s now. Not on Metoprolol as was 
stopped at ___ due to hypotension.

===================
Medication Changes
===================
- None

====================
Transitional Issues
====================
[ ] Continue baseline diet of ground solids with thin liquids 
with medications whole with pureed solids
[ ] Patient is currently taking oral prednisone 10mg daily. 
Appears this was started for possible asthma exacerbation but 
was no end date was given. Will discharge on prednisone 10mg 
daily but recommend tapering as outpatient.
[ ] Please ensure patient doing well with aspiration of cautions 
at home in setting of presbyesophagus.
[ ] If patient is not able to tolerate current diet, diet can be 
downgraded to puree solids. If patient is still having problems 
with aspiration, would have discussion with patient and family 
about PEG placement.
[ ] Patient is prescribed carbidopa 25mg BID, however, patient's 
son states her neurologist told him to give only once in the 
morning. Would clarify this with patient's neurologist

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with history of ___ 
disease, esophageal dysmotility, reactive airway disease 
presenting from home via EMS with inability to ambulate.

History is taken primarily from the patient's son, ___, who is 
at the bedside. He reports that the patient had been in her 
usual state of health until this morning. She gets her 
___ medications at 0700, and then 1000, 1300, 1600, 
___. Her son reports that he gave her the morning dose as 
usual. Then around ___ he tried to get her out of bed, but 
noted that she seemed too weak to stand and had to support her. 
He is not sure whether she seemed more stiff than usual. He then 
gave her the 1000 dose of carbidopa/levodopa, thinking that this 
may be related to her ___ (the patient's Neurologist has 
been uptitrating her dose recently). The patient was able to 
stand after getting her 1000 dose of medication, but she still 
seemed more weak than usual, so he called the ambulance.

Upon EMS arrival she was also found to be hypoxic. She has not 
been expressing any shortness of breath prior to EMS arrival. 
Her son reports that due to her esophageal dysmotility she 
someone has choking/aspiration episodes, but he states that she 
has not had any on the day of presentation. No cough. No fevers, 
chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria, or increased 
urinary frequency. Her son reports that she has not been eating 
or drinking much today. 

Of note, the patient was recently admitted from ___ with 
hypoxia that was thought to be due to viral upper respiratory 
infection triggering reactive airway disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
Brief summary: 

This is a ___ with ___ disease, esophageal dysmotility, 
reactive airway disease presenting from home via EMS with 
inability to ambulate. In the ED she was hypotensive, 
transiently mildly hypoxic, and clearly weak and 
encephalopathic. She was found to have a UTI and also thought to 
be hypovolemic. She improved very impressively with fluid 
resuscitation and antibiotic therapy, to near-baseline (though 
very poor functional status at this baseline). Her antibiotics 
were transitioned to a narrowed spectrum oral regimen prior to 
discharge.

Detailed summary:

# Urinary tract infection: Patient presenting with inability to 
ambulate, found to have positive urinalysis on admission. 
Patient denied symptoms, and was afebrile and without 
leukocytosis, but given her encephalopathy and difficulty 
ambulating, treatment was initiated with ceftriaxone. She 
improved with therapy. Urine culture with >100K E coli, 
pansusceptible. Narrowed to amoxicillin at discharge.
- Complete course of amoxicillin 500mg PO TID x5 more days

# Acute toxic metabolic encephalopathy: Patient sleepy but 
arousable on initial interview, with subsequent course notable 
for waxing/waning alertness. She improved with treatment of UTI 
and dehydration/hypovolemia.

# Inability to ambulate: Patient presenting with inability to 
ambulate, likely due to hypovolemia and UTI. Patient was noted 
to have right nasolabial flattening on exam, son is not sure if 
this was new; neurological exam otherwise seems to be at 
baseline and strength intact in upper and lower extremities and 
head CT was performed for this reason and was negative - likely 
gravitational based on serial exams. She was continued on her 
usual ___ disease medications. Her physical functioning 
improved to near-baseline (which is poor) after treatment of 
UTI/dehydration. She was seen by ___ who recommended discharge 
back to home with 24 hour care.

# Hypotension
# Hypovolemia/dehydration: Patient noted on arrival to be 
hypotensive to the systolic ___, not clearly symptomatic. 
Patient appeared dry on exam, and per report from son has not 
had much to eat or drink day of admission. BPs improved with 
IVF. Of note, patient also on prednisone 10 mg per day at home, 
completed steroid taper from last admission.

# Acute hypoxic respiratory failure: Patient found to be 
hypoxic, requiring 1L oxygen via NC in the ED. Patient was able 
to be weaned to room air upon arrival. CXR clear without 
evidence of pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or aspiration. On exam, 
patient has no wheezing to suggest acute exacerbation of her 
reactive airway disease. ___ have been aspiration event.  
Followed by Dr. ___. Home medications were continued.

# Thrush: Mild. Resolved with some nystatin. 
- Rinse mouth after inhaled steroids

# Esophageal dysmotility: Continued aspiration precautions with 
pureed solids and thickened liquids. She was seen by SLP who 
felt she was doing fairly well and could likely tolerate thin 
liquids (no straws).

# Anemia: Chronic, stable
# ___ disease: Continued carbidopa/levodopa
# Glaucoma: Continued eye gtts
# Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine
# Hypertension: Controlled without medications
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued atorvastatin
# Anxiety: Continued alprazolam as needed
# Insomnia: Continued trazodone; substitute ramelteon for 
melatonin

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF SUMMARY: 

___ with advanced ___ disease, dementia, esophageal 
motility, reactive airway disease presenting with tachypnea in 
the setting of severe constipation. It was thought that she was 
tachypneic due to (1) alteration of respiratory mechanics in the 
setting of abdominal distension from constipation along with (2) 
some aspiration occurring in the setting of her chronic 
oropharyngeal and esophageal dysphagia worsened by the 
aforementioned tachypnea and missing her ___ 
medications. Tachypnea slowly resolved as her constipation 
resolved and she was kept NPO. She was evaluated by SLP during 
this resolution phase and was cleared for her usual diet. She 
appeared to return to her usual baseline and so was discharged 
to home with her usual services and her sons' excellent 
attentive care.

DETAILED SUMMARY:

# Tachypnea
# Mild intermittent hypoxia
# Acute hypoxic respiratory failure
# Esophageal dysmotility: Likely aspiration in setting of 
advanced reactive airways disease and underlying restrictive 
lung mechanics due to advanced kyphosis. This was all likely 
worsened/precipitated by progressive constipation, for which she 
is unable to compensate due to her kyphosis -- leads to 
tachypnea and then tachypnea leads to aspiration which then 
precipitates a viscious cycle of more tachypnea and aspiration. 
Missing her medications also likely contributing. SLP evaluated 
her ___ and felt she was unsafe for any PO, but she appeared to 
do better ___ so diet was advanced and she tolerated this well. 
She appeared to return to her baseline by today ___ and so was 
discharged home.
- Note: A G tube can be considered for her, if in the future she 
really cannot meet her nutritional goals and can't take meds, 
but when we involved her in the discussion she said she did not 
want one. She improved so this was not explored further, but it 
may present a potential barrier to pursuing tube placement in 
the future. 

# Constipation: Severe on presentation but now moving her 
bowels. We adjusted her bowel medications to maintain 1BM per 
day. Counselled son on the following regimen:
- Standing senna now BID, Miralax now daily
- PRN Bisacodyl given HS if no BM that day

# Acute toxic metabolic encephalopathy
# Dementia: Baseline cognitive status per ___ is ""pretty high 
functioning,"" but apparently always thinks that it is ___ 
(with air conditioning always on at home), and is not oriented 
to events. Agitation on admission likely driven by recent 
constipation followed by repeated visits to the ED overnight. At 
home pt is maintained on low dose alprazolam which typically 
provides benefit for her anxiety and agitation. She improved by 
the AM after admission and appeared to be at her baseline for 
the remainder of her hospital stay.

# Advanced ___ disease: Slowly progressive per its usual 
course. Now quite advanced. Most of her above issues are the 
result of this condition. Her home medications were continued 
according to her precise home schedule and she did well. 
Neurology was not consulted this admission given her 
improvement. 

# Anemia: Chronic, stable
# Glaucoma: Continued home eye gtts
# Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued atorvastatin
# Anxiety: Continued alprazolam as needed
# Insomnia: Continued low dose home trazodone; substitute 
ramelteon for melatonin

Brief Hospital Course:
# Hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen: 
The etiology of the patient's hypoxia at home is unclear.  Her 
oxygen saturations improved quickly when she reached ___ 
ED and she was on room air when she arrived at ___.  Chest XR 
did now show a pneumonia.  I suspect she was having trouble 
clearing her throat due to lethargy (side-effect from prior 
Xanax use) and had a transient airway obstruction or mucus plug 
as the source of her hypoxia.  While she was in the hospital she 
was continued on her home duonebs, flovent and prednisone.  Her 
son ___ plans to only give her half of a Xanax for anxiety in 
the future.

# Toxic Metabolic Encephalopathy: 
Her altered mental status at the time of admission was likely 
from a combination of medication side-effect (Xanax) as well as 
urinary tract infection.  UA was positive and urine culture grew 
> 100,000 CFU pan sensitive Klebsiella.  She completed a course 
of antibiotics while hospitalized.  Sedating medications were 
used sparingly and son ___ try melatonin for sleep rather 
than a benzodiazepine.  Trazodone was held.  

# Troponinemia:
- Initial troponin at ___ was 0.02.  She was 
transferred to ___ for further evaluation.  Her troponins 
trended 0.02 --> 0.02 --> <0.01.  Her EKG was unchanged from her 
baseline and she did not show any signs of ACS.

# Constipation: Continue senna, Miralax, bisacodyl

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS:
# Anemia: Chronic, stable
# Glaucoma: Continued home eye gtts
# Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued atorvastatin
# Anxiety: Continued alprazolam sparingly as needed
# Insomnia: Substitute melatonin for trazodone at discharge
# GERD: Nexium

Appeal of Discharge: Patient's son ___ appealed his mother's 
discharge.  He had a few concerns as follows.  He wanted his 
mother to complete the course of antibiotics in the hospital.  I 
explained that this was not necessary since we had culture data 
to ensure good response to PO medications.  He wanted his mother 
to have a feeding tube placed.  While this can be considered, 
___ had recently passed a swallow evaluation and had done well 
with her medications and honey thick diet in the hospital.  She 
showed no signs of aspiration.  When I initially discussed a 
feeding tube with ___, she said she did not want one.  I 
advised ___ to discuss this topic further with his PCP and 
___.

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Bedbound.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with altered mental status and decreased 
oxygen levels.  You were likely altered (confused, not acting 
yourself) since you had a urinary tract infection and you had 
taken a sedating medication, Xanax, the night before.  You were 
given an antibiotic to treat your pneumonia. 

You also had low oxygen levels at home.  Since you were confused 
and sleepy, you likely had trouble clearing your mucus 
secretions.  This brief mucus blockage was the likely cause of 
your low oxygen level at home.  You did not show any signs of 
pneumonia and your oxygen levels quickly returned to normal.

At home, please ensure you give yourself adequate time to eat 
your meals.  Please decrease use of sedating medications like 
Xanax or take half a pill of Xanax.  You will follow-up with 
your primary care doctor and ___ as below.

IMAGING/STUDIES
================

CT ABD/PELVIS ___
1. No acute abnormality within the abdomen or pelvis. 
2. Sigmoid diverticulosis, without evidence of acute 
diverticulitis. 
3. Stable compression deformities of the T11, L1, and L2 
vertebral bodies. 

CXR ___
Left basilar atelectasis.  No definite acute cardiopulmonary 
abnormality.

G-TUBE PLACEMENT ___
A 65 cm, 5 ___ glide catheter was negotiated through the 
Nares down to the stomach using a 0.035 glidewire.  Position in 
the stomach was confirmed with injection of air.  The tube was 
then secured and used for insufflation.  A scout image of the 
abdomen was obtained. The stomach was insufflated through the 
indwelling nasogastric tube. Under fluoroscopic guidance, 2 T 
fastener buttons were sequentially deployed elevating the 
stomach to the anterior abdominal wall. Intra-gastric position 
was confirmed with aspiration of air and injection of contrast. 
A 19 gauge needle was introduced under fluoroscopic guidance and 
position confirmed using an injection of dilute contrast. A 
Amplatz wire was introduced into the  stomach. A small skin 
incision was made along the needle and the needle was removed. 
After sequential dilation using 12, 14 in 16 ___ dilators, a 
18 ___  peel-away sheath was placed.  A 14 ___ MIC 
gastrostomy catheter was advanced over the wire into position. 
The catheter was secured by instilling dilute contrast into the 
balloon.  Contrast injection confirmed intragastric  position.  
The catheter was then flushed, capped and secured. Sterile 
dressings were applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well 
and there were no immediate 
complications. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with ___ disease, esophageal dysmotility, dementia 
who presented with hip pain versus abdominal pain, developed 
acute hypoxia while in the ED from aspiration. Admitted to the 
hospital for hypoxia.

#GOALS OF CARE:
#CHRONIC ASPIRATION
#UNINTENTIONAL WEIGHT LOSS
   The patient has oropharyngeal dysphagia due to her advanced 
___ disease and esophageal dysphagia due to her 
esophageal dysmotility. She had been taking a honey-thick diet 
at home (mostly Boost), but had been losing weight despite the 
heroic efforts of her son to encourage oral feedings, and also 
had a clinically overt aspiration event in the ED despite 
texture modification of her diet. She was seen by speech and 
swallow, who felt that even if we thicken food enough to help 
with the oropharyngeal phase of swallow, there is little we can 
do about the esophageal issue; she was recommended for strict 
NPO. 
    Given that the dysphagia is related to issues other than her 
dementia (which is not end-stage), we felt she would be a 
candidate for a feeding tube, if within the goals of care. It 
was difficult to directly understand the patient's own goals - 
there is prior documentation that the patient would refuse a 
feeding tube, and she was able to say in AM on ___ (in front 
of myself, attending MD, RN, and son) that she would not want a 
feeding tube. Since then, she said ""I'm thinking about it"" when 
asked about wanting a feeding tube. It was very difficult to 
interpret patient's wishes in this setting, and as such, we had 
to rely on the patient's son and HCP ___, who is her 
___ caregiver at home. We discussed with him that feeding tubes 
do not eliminate the risk of aspiration, but that it would 
probably be safer than oral feedings and would at least help to 
deliver nutrition more reliably and successfully. After some 
vacillation, he ultimately decided he was strongly in favor of a 
feeding tube.
    As such, interventional radiology was consulted and a PEG 
was successfully placed on ___. Tube feeds initiated on 
___ - pt tolerated well prior to discharge. She will receive 
cycled tube feeds 16 hours per day. She is also continued on her 
home BID PPI (to reduce the acidity of gastric contents should 
she micro-aspirate) and on BID chlorhexidine mouthwash.

#ACUTE HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE:
#REACTIVE AIRWAY DISEASE:
#CHRONIC ASPIRATION RISK:
    Hypoxia resolved over time - ultimately it was attributed to 
aspiration pneumonitis. She is followed by Dr ___ 
pulmonology - she does not have a formal pulmonary diagnosis, as 
she is unable to cooperate for PFTs, but seems to have some mild 
pulmonary fibrosis and some kind of reactive airway disease. No 
symptoms this admission suggestive of exacerbation of reactive 
airway disease. She was continued on all of her home 
inhalers/nebulizers. 

#RIGHT SIDE PAIN:
   Pt had originally presented with pain in R side while 
ambulating - though per prior ___ records, pt is largely 
wheelchair bound and requires a lift at home for transfers, so 
unclear how much she is ambulating. She has no pain on arrival 
to the floor and no pain is elicited on exam. Had CT abd without 
any findings to explain possible RLQ pain. Has had intermittent 
constipation; ensured robust bowel regimen. Clinically felt to

Dx: ___ disease, esophageal dysmotility

Discharge Disposition:
Home With Service
 
Facility:
___
 
Discharge Diagnosis:
PRIMARY DIAGNOSES: 
Acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to aspiration 
___ disease 
Esophageal dysmotility 
 
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 
Muscle spasms 
 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or 
wheelchair.

 
Discharge Instructions:
WHY WERE YOU ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL?
- Your oxygen level was low and you were requiring extra oxygen.

WHAT HAPPENED WHILE YOU WERE IN THE HOSPITAL?
- You had multiple episodes of aspiration while you were here; 
ultimately, it was decided that you would have a feeding tube 
placed. You had a G-tube placed and started to receive nutrition 
that way.
- You were seen by our nutritionists and speech/language 
pathologists - it was determined that, due to your risk of 
aspiration, it was not safe for you to eat or drink anything by 
mouth. You should get all of your nutrition and medicines 
through your feeding tube. 
- You were given fluid through an IV.
- Your oxygen level improved and was stable without extra 
oxygen.
- We gave you Tylenol and ibuprofen for the pain in your right 
side.

WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN YOU LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?
- Continue to take all of your medicines as prescribed.
- Continue your nutrition through your feeding tube. We 
recommend that, if you truly want to minimize your risk of 
aspiration, you do not eat or drink anything by mouth. 
- That said... many people sometimes decide to do unsafe things 
that make them happy. If you feel it is important for quality of 
life to accept the risk of taking a few sips of honey-thick 
liquid once in a while, that is not totally unreasonable. People 
want to stay healthy, but they want to be happy too! 
- Please keep all of your appointments, as scheduled.

Imaging:
========
-___ CXR (PA & lateral)
  ""FINDINGS: Patient is kyphotic in position.  Patient's chin
overlies the lung apices, partially obscuring the view.  There
are small bilateral pleural effusions.  No definite focal
consolidation is seen.  There is no evidence pneumothorax. 
Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.  Chronic
bilateral rib deformities are again re-demonstrated.  Bones are
diffusely osteopenic and there is a chronic appearing deformity
at the left shoulder.  Previously seen compression deformities 
of
the spine were better assessed on prior studies. 
   IMPRESSION:  Patient's chin overlies the lung apices,
partially obscuring the view.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
are seen.  No definite focal consolidation. 

-___ CXR (portable):
IMPRESSION: Study is limited as the patient's head obscures the
lung apex on the left. There are very low lung volumes.  There 
is
extensive osteopenia and several old rib fractures bilateral. 
There is coarsening of the bronchovascular markings bilaterally
without overt pulmonary edema or focal consolidation.  No
definite pneumothoraces are identified.  Overall findings are
unchanged.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Presented with reported productive cough, dyspnea, and lethargy. 
Disconcertingly, but consistently, her son, ___ would 
often say that she had a symptom, but when the patient was asked 
how she was feeling or asked specifically about that symptom, 
she would often say she was not feeling that way.

She did have a productive cough, however she did not demonstrate 
dyspnea or lethargy during her hospital course. Her CXR was not 
consistent with PNA. She had no other findings to suggest a 
bacterial infection. It was thought this represented a possible 
exacerbation of her chronic ""reactive airway disease"" which, 
itself, does not seem to have a clear underlying etiology, 
though perhaps may be due to chronic aspiration. She was treated 
with her usual home medications and she did well. No additional 
steroids were given and no antibiotics were given.

Leading up to the time of discharge, the patient's son made 
numerous requests of additional testing in an apparent attempt 
to delay and/or prevent discharge. He made all of these requests 
under the auspices of ""advocating for my mother,"" but many of 
the requests were made repeatedly, and aggressively towards the 
nursing staff, despite clear counseling by the patient's 
physicians that the tests were not necessary and would not be 
performed/repeated. His requests also did not align with the 
patient's clinical condition. On the day prior to discharge and 
the day of discharge, the patient herself noted that she felt 
quite good, was not having shortness of breath, and overall felt 
better than prior to admission. She was not noted to have any 
periods of significant dyspnea that did not respond to her usual 
home nebulizer treatments, and she was not noted to be lethargic 
during her time in the hospital.

We counseled her son that ongoing long-term prednisone use may 
not be advisable in her case.  Specifically, prednisone 
increases her risk of skin injuries (she has some already), 
slowed wound healing, osteoporosis with more fragility fractures 
(she has several already), anxiety (which has been increasingly 
problematic per family), and stomach ulcers (particularly when 
combined with Advil she takes for pain).  We advised that they 
discuss this further with Dr. ___ primary pulmonologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with ___ disease, esophageal dysmotility w/ chronic 
aspirations s/p PEG for feeding, reactive airway disease on 
chronic glucocorticoids, presenting with increased PEG-tube 
residuals, found to have suspected pneumonia and rib fractures 
on CT chest. Patient received treatment for pneumonia and had 
persistent
episodes of hypoxemia due to aspiration from esophageal 
dysmotility, extreme kyphosis and atelectasis, dyskinesias from 
___ disease and underlying lung disease from COPD and
bronchiectasis. The patient was planned for discharge with 
appropriate ___ services and home O2 services, but patient son 
appealed the discharge. The case was reviewed by medicare who 
agreed with the medical team. 

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
#Community acquired pneumonia
Patient has chronic cough with multiple recent admissions for 
increased cough and lethargy (per son's report, but some 
discrepancy w/ clinician observation, per prior notes). Has been 
afebrile, but has a mild lekocytosis, soft BPs, and a lingular 
consolidation on CT. Therefore, treated for CAP. That being 
said, CT changes and low-grade leukocytosis may simply represent 
pneumonitis from chronic aspiration +/- atelectasis. Treated 
with IV ceftriaxone/azithromycin for a total 5 day course 
(___). Persistent O2 requirement discussed below. 

#COPD
#Bronchiectasis 
#Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure 
Patient has been on 10 mg prednisone for some time now. Son 
called her pulmonologist due to perceived increase in WOB and 
respiratory distress and he recommended increasing prednisone to 
40 mg daily (she received 2 doses of 40 mg). On exam, patient 
was mildly tachypneic but without wheezing. Did not start 
prednisone burst, as pt has had well-documented 
prednisone-related side effects, and her respiratory status 
appears stable. She was continued on her home fluticasone, 
ipratropium, levalbuterol, and fomoterol breathing treatments, 
and prednisone 10mg qd. She was given guaifenasin q6h prn. Her 
fluctuations in respiratory function and persistent O2 
requirement despite treatment for CAP and COPD is likely due to 
chronic aspiration from esophageal dysmotility, extreme kyphosis 
and atelectasis, dyskinesias from ___ disease and 
underlying lung disease from COPD and bronchiectasis. The 
patient was discharged with home oxygen. She will have follow up 
with her pulmonologist to determine taper for prednisone. 

#Acute, subacute, and chronic rib fractures
Likely related to osteoporosis (w/ progressive demineralization 
from chronic prednisone use) and chronic cough. Evaluated by 
trauma, who do not recommend any surgical intervention. 

#Esophageal dysmotility
#Tube feed residuals 
Patient had one episode of 300 cc TF residual without any sign 
of clinical obstruction. Informed son that residuals do not need 
be checked regularly. Tube feeds were transitioned to the AM 
hours for 17 hours/day given family concern for aspirations from 
tube feeds. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
___ Disease 
Continued home carbidopa-levodopa

DISCHARGE APPEAL
================
  Repeated discussions with ___ (Son-HCP) were held 
regarding the poor prognosis for ___.  She is prone to 
aspirations, recurrent hypoxia with repeated mucous plugging.  
Given her Parksinson's, esophageal dysmotility, kyphosis and 
deconditioning, little can be done to prevent these aspirations 
from recurring.  She already has a PEG tube in place.  Despite 
efforts to impart the fact that providing ongoing care may 
actually be counterproductive, he did not appear willing to 
listen and insisted that everything should be done.  
   He appealed the discharge to Medicare - and the decision was 
made in agreement with our assessment.  She was discharged home 
with added oxygen, suctioning equipment and followup.  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================

[] Pulmonology: will work on tapering prednisone.
[] Neurology: continue to optimize sinemet. After receiving 
sinemet, patient is having significant dyskinesias exacerbating 
oxygen desaturations. 
[] Patient has a suction machine to help clear her secretions. 
The patient will need to have a renewed script to resupply the 
machine versus obtain a new machine. 
[] Patient was discharged with home oxygen. Continue to reassess 
need for oxygen. 
[] Continue to discuss with family that checking tube feed 
residuals are not necessary and have not been proven to show any 
benefit. 
[] Continue to reinforce the patient's progressive decline from 
underlying chronic medical diseases.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:
========
Ms. ___ is ___ female with past medical history of 
___ disease, advanced dementia, esophageal dysmotility 
w/ chronic aspirations s/p PEG for feeding, reactive airway 
disease on chronic glucocorticoids who presented with increased 
work of breathing and increased cough with sputum/secretions, 
found to have acute hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure, 
MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia, frequent bradycardia, and 
hypotension. 

ACUTE ISSUES 
=============== 
# Acute hypoxemic hypercarbic respiratory failure 
Initially presenting with hypoxia. Her respiratory failure 
worsened and was started on HFNC and eventually was intubated on 
___ after goals of care discussions with the family. She was 
given aggressive pulmonary toilet. Attempts to wean the 
ventilator were not successful, so she ultimately underwent 
tracheostomy placement and bronchoscopy on ___. Patient 
continued to have intermittent low minute ventilation so 
required switching from pressure support to volume control. She 
will need ongoing ventilator weaning after discharge. 

# Sepsis secondary to HAP
# MRSA pneumonia
# Pseudomonas PNA
CXR demonstrated findings concerning for multifocal pneumonia. 
Her sputum grew MRSA and Pseudomonas. For her MRSA pneumonia, 
she was given 10 days of vancomycin. For her Pseudomonas 
infection, she was initially treated with cefepime, but 
ultimately transitioned to IV ciprofloxacin for an additional 7 
days after her Pseudomonas developed intermediate sensitivities 
to cefepime. Last day of ciprofloxacin is ___. 

# Hypotension
Requiring pressors after being intubated. Likely ___ sedatives 
and sepsis. Given norepi for goal MAP >65. She did 
intermittently have brief hypotensive episodes throughout 
hospitalization that were fluid responsive. There may have been 
a component of difficulty measuring BPs given frequent 
movements. 

# Reactive airway disease/COPD
# Chronic aspiration
Patient has been on long-standing prednisone. Concern for 
chronic aspiration in the setting of esophageal dysmotility with 
kyphosis and dyskinesias from ___. Given high dose 
prednisone (50 mg) for 5 days followed by taper in addition to 
aggressive nebulizer regimen. She will be maintained on her home 
prednisone dose of 10 mg PO daily afterwards. 

# Recurrent episodes of bradycardia 
Before intubation, patient would intermittently have bradycardic 
episodes including a 10-second pause on telemetry in the setting 
of hypoxia and discomfort. Electrophysiology was consulted who 
did not feel that this regard prior to pacemaker placement. 
These episodes did not recur after intubation. Likely related to 
vagal episodes. 

# Coag negative staph in blood cultures 
Grown in one set of cultures, thought to be ___ contamination. 

# Diarrhea
C. diff negative. Likely ___ tube feeds. 

# Skin excoriations in groin
Foley placed for skin breakdown on external genitalia ___ 
urinary incontinence. 

# Hypernatremia
Likely ___ poor PO intake. Resolved with increased free water 
flushes. 

# Anemia
# Thrombocytopenia
Likely secondary to sepsis and antibiotics. Improved with 
treatment of infections. 

CHRONIC PROBLEMS:
=================
# Subacute and chronic rib fractures
Found on prior admission and thought to be due to chronic cough 
and osteoporosis. Continued Tylenol, ibuprofen and lidocaine 
patches. 

# ___ Disease
# Advanced dementia
Continued home carbidopa-levodopa and carbidopa. 

# Esophageal dysmotility
Continued tube feeds through PEG

# HLD
Continued home atorvastatin daily 

# GERD
Continued home lansoprazole 30 mg PO BID 

# Hypothyroidism
Continued home levothyroxine 25 mcg daily 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[] Continue IV ciprofloxacin to end on ___
[] Please attempt to wean ventilator support 
[] Continue goals of care discussions if unable to be weaned 
from ventilator 
[] Please remove foley and attempt voiding trial
[] Pseudomonas developed resistance to cefepime, ceftazadime, 
and piperacillin-tazobactam. Please avoid use of these 
antibiotics in the future if concern for pneumonia
[] Prednisone taper
___: 20 mg x2 days
___: 10 mg PO daily indefinitely

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,  

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___!  

Why was I admitted to the hospital?  
=================================
- You were admitted because you were having difficulty breathing 
and were found to have a pneumonia.

What happened while I was in the hospital?  
====================================
- You had testing done to figure out what kind of pneumonia you 
had.  This showed you had 2 infections call MRSA and 
Pseudomonas.
 You were given IV antibiotics to treat these infections.
 You were given higher dose prednisone to help with 
inflammation in your lungs. 
 We placed you on a breathing machine called a ventilator to 
help you breath. Because you could not breathe without this 
machine, a tracheostomy (breathing tube in the neck) was placed, 
which will help you to breathe with the support of the 
ventilator, but be more comfortable. 

What should I do after leaving the hospital?  
============================================
- Please take your medications as listed in discharge summary 
and follow up at the listed appointments. 

Thank you for allowing us to be involved in your care, we wish 
you all the best!  

Sincerely,

Your ___ Healthcare Team

History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ year old woman with history of advanced
___, advanced dementia, bilateral blindness, reactive
airway disease on chronic prednisone, HTN, HLD, COPD,
hypothyroidism, and recent admission for MRSA and pseudomonas
PNA, which resulted in trach/peg, now with vent dependence, who
now presents from her rehab (___) with fevers despite 
multiple
courses of antibiotics.

Since her last discharge for MRSA and pseudomonas (with 
inducible
resistance to cefepime and ceftaz) PNA, she has been on
antibiotics for resistant organisms for all but ~5 days. She has
been followed by ID while at ___, and while there, was
on vanc/cipro -> bactrim/meropenem (for stenotrophomonas and
pseudomonas) -> vancomycin/ceftaz-avibactam. She was scheduled 
to
continue Vancomycin and ceftaz/avibactam until ___ but
continued to spike fevers as high as ___, so she was sent to
___ for further evaluation per the son's request. Patient is
non-verbal and unable to provide meaningful history or ROS. She
is confirmed full code.

Of note, according to a progress note from ___ on ___
the son has been verbally abusive and yelling at staff 
requesting
that ""full investigation of all patient's current medical
problems and maximal support."" 

In the ED, 

Initial Vitals: T 99.7, HR 96, BP 176/86, RR 20 on vent.

Exam: Chronically ill appearing, frail, appears uncomfortable.
Trach midline, no surrounding erythema or drainage. Diminished

- CT A/P: no acute pathology on wet read
- RUE ___: Nonocclusive thrombi are present in the right
brachial and basilic veins. Occlusive thrombus in the right
cephalic vein. However, the right internal jugular, axillary, 
and
brachial veins appear patent, showing normal color flow and
spectral doppler. The right basilic vein is narrowed but patent.

The ED team reached out to ID, who recommended continuing
antibiotics without escalation pending culture data and imaging.

She received:
- IV LR @ 75cc/hr

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old woman with history of advanced ___, 
bilateral blindness, reactive airway disease on chronic 
prednisone, HTN, HLD, COPD, hypothyroidism, and recent admission 
for MRSA and pseudomonas PNA, which resulted in trach/peg, now 
with vent dependence, who now presents from her rehab (___) 
with persistent fevers and leukocytosis despite broad spectrum 
ABX for PNA, found to have bilateral UE DVT. Fevers likely 
non-infectious, so antibiotics discontinued. Patient stable and 
discharged back to ___. 

ACUTE ISSUES 
=============== 
# Fevers
Patient presents from ___ with persistent fevers and 
mild leukocytosis despite broad spectrum coverage for her 
resistant PNAs. ID was consulted and felt that her culture data 
likely reflects colonization, given her non-inflammatory sputum 
studies, stable vent settings, and stable secretions. The most 
likely etiology of her fevers is non infectious such as drug 
fever or ___ DVT. Notably, she was found to
have RUE DVT of brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins of the 
RUE. She was also found to have LUE DVT of axillary veins (with 
PICC still in place). It is possible this could be contributing 
to her fevers. Less likely new or persistent bacterial 
infection, though viral infection could be considered. Flu neg. 

# Bilateral UE Catheter Associated DVT:
Patient presented with RUE edema, found to have RUE thrombi of 
the brachial (non-occlusive), cephalic (occlusive), and basilic 
(non-occlusive) veins. This occurred in the setting of RUE PICC 
placed in the R basilic vein last admission (subsequently 
removed). She was also found to have partially occlusive LUE 
thrombi within the axillary (deep) and proximal basilic veins, 
with PICC still in place due to necessity of frequent lab draws. 
After extensive conversation with the patient's son (HCP) re: 
risks and benefits of anticoagulation, it was ultimately decided 
to anticoagulate with warfarin, with lovneox bridge. She will 
need repeat ultrasounds to assess for clot resolution on 
anticoagulation, minimum planned duration 3 months. Will also 
need to monitor for e/o active bleeding.

# L UE Erythema
The patient was found to have L upper arm erythema in the 
setting of L UE DVT, with some excoriations of the skin. Given 
improvement with topical emollients and without antibiotics, 
this was thought to be excoriation in the setting of her chronic 
steroid use, and less likely an overlying cellulitis. This 
should continue to be monitored at ___.

# Chronic Hypoxic respiratory failure: 
The patient is trached and vent dependent in the setting of 
advanced dementia. Her Trach cuff pressures were within normal 
limits(28). She was continued on her outpatient ventilator 
settings of CMV overnight and PSV during day. Trach sputum 
cultures grew pseudomonas, but given low PMNs and scant sputum 
production with stable vent settings, suspect colonization as 
opposed to active infection.

# Normocytic Anemia
The patient has a recent baseline Hgb of 7.5-8.5, and has 
required 2u PRBC while at
___. Did have guaiac + stools there, though no evidence of 
overt bleeding. Could represent a slow GIB vs marrow suppression 
in the setting of recent infections. s/p 1UPRBC with robust 
response supporting that acute bleed is less likely. Iron 
studies suggest anemia of chronic inflammation.

CHRONIC ISSUES 
=============== 
# Esophageal dysmotility: s/p PEG: The patient was continued on 
nutrition's final tube feed recs from her last admission

# ___: Continued home carbidopa/levodopa regimen

# HLD: Continued home statin

# Chronic pain: Continued APAP. Home NSAIDs were held in the 
setting of anemia. 

# Reactive airway disease, copd: Continued home prednisone 10mg 
daily and home inhalers

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:

[]L UE PICC was left in given anticipated need for serial lab 
draws with challenging venous access

[]Repeat bilateral UE U/S in 1 month (___) to evaluate RUE 
DVT and LUE DVT to determine needed duration of anticoagulation. 
Anticipated duration of anticoagulation is 3 months, but will 
potentially need longer given PICC left in place.

[]Avoid BP cuffs in UE iso DVT. The patient's son requests that 
all BPs be taken in the left leg just below the knee.

[]f/u blood cultures ___: No growth to date at time of 
discharge

[]for pain control, the patient's son prefers 1.25mg oxycodone 
PRN for pain. The patient did respond well to small (0.125mg) IV 
dilaudid boluses. Could consider supplementing with IV dilaudid 
PRN for pain control.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a privilege taking care of you at ___ 
___.  

WHY WAS I ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL?
===================================
- You were admitted to the hospital because you were found to 
have fevers at your rehab. 

WHAT HAPPENED WHILE I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL?
==========================================
- There was a concern that you had pneumonia and you were 
continued on antibiotics. However your symptoms appeared to be 
unlikely from an infection and your antibiotics were stopped.

is possible that these blood clots were causing your fevers. We 
discussed the risks and benefits of starting a blood thinner 
with your family, and we ultimately chose to start a blood 
thinner.
- You had low blood counts and needed a blood transfusion. Your 
blood counts improved.   

WHAT SHOULD I DO AFTER I LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?
============================================  
- Please continue to take all your medications and follow up 
with your doctors at your ___ appointments.  
- Your blood counts will need to be monitored closely in the

===========================  
___ with h/o advanced ___, dementia, blindness, HTN, 
HLD,
COPD, hypothyroidism, who is now ___ dependent after
pseudomonas pneumonia presents to the ED with c/o respiratory
distress. She was discharged from rehab yesterday. ___ reports
that she had been doing well at ___. About ___ weeks ago she
had a pneumonia that was treated w/ antibiotics he is unsure 
what
kind. He notes increased upper airway sounds especially when she
is on a trach mask. He had requested a CXR at ___ but they did
not do one. He says she had no oral temperatures there. He says
she has been doing well and continues to communicate when there
they create a leak in her trach. Additionally she raises her
right hand with issues. Lately she has been raising her right
hand with concerns when he asks her. Lately it has been with 
pain
in her back. 

She came home to her son yesterday. He noted that she has had
intermittent episodes of having respiratory rates of ___ and
then it will go up to 30 for a few seconds and back down. He is
concerned this is new for her and he talked to a respiratory
therapist who he has on call who recommended she get evaluated. 

While at OSH she had episodes of tachypnea. CXR was c/f
persistent pneumonia with lactate 2.2. She was given a dose of
Vancomycin and Cefepime and transferred to ___.

Of note the patient had persistent fevers in the past despite
broad spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia. ID has been consulted
in the past and felt that she likely has colonization. They
believe she likely had fevers due to non-infectious source or
drug fever. She had a DVT in her RUE brachial, basilica and
cephalic veins. She also had LUE DVT of the axillary. The
decision last admission, despite many risks was to
anticoagulation with warfarin with a lovenox bridge. She was to
get 3 weeks of anticoagulation as she had a PICC in place. She
remained vent dependent previously. 

In the ED she had a fever to 101.4. She had a HR of 81, RR 14.
She was on her home ventilator settings of CMV, 400/10/5/28%. 

Her exam showed bilateral rhonchi, no sores appreciated or other
abnormalities.   

Lab work up showed a VBG 7.46/45. Lactate 1.3. WBC 8.0 
Hemoglobin
9.4. Remaining lab work was pending at time of transfer. Lactate
2.2 at OSH vanc and Cefepime given at OSH. Started on NS. 

ROS: Positives as per HPI; otherwise negative.

Brief Hospital Course:
PATIENT SUMMARY
===================
Ms ___ is a ___ year old woman with history of advanced 
___, bilateral blindness, reactive airway disease on 
chronic prednisone, HTN, HLD, COPD, hypothyroidism, and recent 
admission for MRSA and pseudomonas PNA which resulted in 
___, now with vent dependence (___), who now 
presents from her home w/ tachypnea (intermittent) found on last 
admission to have bl UE DVT (transitioned to warfarin). She has 
no leukocytosis on admission and no further fevers over one in 
ED. Staph coag negative at ___ and ___ culture, likely both 
contaminants.

ACUTE ISSUES 
=============== 
# Fever (noted x 1)
Most likely still colonized as noted before. Contaminated sputum 
here, CXR w/o PNA. No leukocytosis and maintains baseline 
tachypnea per prior providers. She finished her last course of 
antibiotics ___ weeks ago at ___. White count stable, no 
tachycardia. Afebrile other than 1 ED rectal temperature. One 
blood culuture at OSH and one blood culture at ___ with staph 
epi (one at OSH, one ___, but stable, thus thought to both be 
contaminants). 

#Chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure
#Trach dependent
Gas on admission reassuring. Continued home settings on trach, 
weaned as tolerated. She transitioned to trach mask, and 
intermittently used the ventilator if she appeared to be in 
respiratory distress. However this was weaned throughout her 
stay, and she was stably maintained on trach mask before 
discharge, with oxygen saturations 98-100% on 35% FiO2 and no 
respiratory distress. She did not need mechanical ventilation 
for 36 hours prior to discharge. 

# Bilateral UE Catheter Associated DVT:
Diagnosed previous admission ___ - ___. Repeat 
ultrasound here showed no evdience of DVT in upper extremity 
veins in setting of Warfarin since discharge in ___. Plan to 
continue anticoag until end of ___ with warfarin goal INR ___, 
with consideration of transitioning to enoxaparin ___omplete for lifelong anticoagulation, as she has a 
propensity to develop venothromboemboli. 

# Normocytic anemia
The patient has a recent baseline Hgb of 7.5-8.5m/dL. Iron 
studies from her last admission suggest anemia of chronic 
inflammation. She requires intermittent transfusions. 

# Severe protein-calorie malnutrition
She was continued on tube feeds per recommendation of the 
Nutrition service. 

CHRONIC ISSUES 
=============== 
# Esophageal dysmotility: s/p ___: The patient was continued on 
the Nutrition service's final tube feed recs from her last 
admission

# ___: Continued home carbidopa/levodopa regimen 
(adjusted while at ___)

# HLD: Continued home statin

# Chronic pain: We transitioned standing acetaminophen to PRN as 
she did not appear in pain, and nodded no when asked if she was 
in any pain. Home NSAIDs were held in the setting of anemia. She 
should continue on as-needed pain control with acetaminophen or 
very low dose oxycodone. 

# Reactive airway disease, copd: Taper prednisone as below in 
transitional issues

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[] if patient to go home in future, continue trach/vent teaching 
w/ son
[] continue on going discussions w/ family regarding prognosis 
and goals of care
[] Please discuss with family long-term anticoagulation given 
propensity for venous thromboembolism. 
[] Patient does well on trach mask, only needs ventilator if o2 
sat decreases or she appears in respiratory distress. 
[] prednisone taper as follows: 5 mg PO daily until ___, 2.5 mg 
starting ___ through ___, then stop prednisone. 
Re-evaluate need if symptoms worsen off of prednisone. 

Code: Full, confirmed w/ Son (___), Proxy ___

This patient was prescribed, or continued on, an opioid pain 
medication at the time of discharge (please see the attached 
medication list for details). As part of our safe opioid 
prescribing process, all patients are provided with an opioid 
risks and treatment resource education sheet and encouraged to 
discuss this therapy with their outpatient providers to 
determine if opioid pain medication is still indicated.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ female with advanced ___, 
chronic respiratory failure s/p trach, chronic aspiration with 
PEG, dementia, hypertension, hyperlipidemia who is presenting 
with distal fibula (?tibial as well) fracture and found to have 
concerns for UTI in the ED. She was admitted to the ICU given 
chronic respiratory failure and brief hypotension in the ED 
which responded to IVF.

#Comminuted distal fibula fracture
Presenting with distal fibula fracture after having trauma on
stationary bike. She was initially placed in a right lower 
extremity splint, which was subsequently casted by the 
orthopedics service. She received her home acetaminophen dose 
and oxycodone as needed for pain control. She has follow-up 
scheduled with orthopedics. 

#Hypotension, improved
Patient was briefly hypotensive in the ED with SBPs in the ___, 
Improved with 1L NS. Lactate within normal limits. Etiology 
likely either hypovolemia vs. sepsis. Given hyponatremia, 
possibly related to hypovolemia, especially given rapid 
improvement after small amount of IVF. Some concerns for UTI as 
noted below. 

#UTI
Patient found to have pyuria on UA in setting of leukocytosis. 
No other clear source of infection. She was given a 7 day course 
of ceftriaxone as treatment for urinary tract infection which 
was then transitioned to Keflex. 

#Chronic respiratory failure 
Respiratory status appears at baseline, patient has a 
tracheostomy. CXR without evidence of consolidation. Home 
settings on trach were continued with trach mask during the day 
and ventilator at night, and her home medications were 
continued. 

___: Her home carbidopa/levodopa regimen was continued. 
She had some episodes of agitation overnight and her outpatient 
neurologist Dr. ___ was consulted, who recommended an 
additional 1.5 tabs of Sinamet as needed at 3 am for agitation. 
This was noted to improve her agitation overnight. 

#Bradycardia: While in the ICU, the patient had intermittent 
episodes of sinus bradycardia overnight in the setting of being 
off the ventilator and while episodes of agitation. EKG showed 
no evidence of bundle branch block or heart block. This was 
thought to be secondary to the vasovagal episodes given timing 
with episodes of agitation as well as being off the ventilator. 
She did not have any hypotension during these episodes and 
continued to be monitored throughout her stay.  Her son, ___, 
expressed interest in a cardiology evaluation for which we 
provided him the contact information to schedule an outpatient 
appointment as her bradycardia resolved with improvement in 
agitation and pain control.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY
=======
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with chronic respiratory 
failure s/p tracheostomy ___ (nocturnally ventilated), chronic 
aspiration s/p PEG, dementia, advanced ___, HTN, 
hyperlipidemia, recent admission for a right fibula fracture, 
and other issues who presented on ___ with apparent 
lethargy (reported by her son, as the patient is variably 
interactive) in the setting of a reported right lower lobe 
pneumonia apparently noted on outpatient imaging on the day 
prior to presentation. On repeat imaging on presentation to 
___, there were no definite signs of pneumonia and there were 
no clinical indications of acute systemic inflammation or 
infection. She remained on her home ventilator settings at night 
and trach mask during the day. Although very broad spectrum 
antibiotics were provided on presentation in the ED, given the 
absence of infection on chest imaging and the lack of clinical 
symptoms of an acute infection, all antibiotics were stopped 
upon ICU admission, and she was monitored off of antibiotics for 
24 hours without any signs of clinical instability. She was 
subsequently discharged home without antibiotics.

ACUTE ISSUES 
============
# Concern for right upper lobe pneumonia (without radiographic 
or clinical evidence of right upper lobe pneumonia) 
# Chronic respiratory failure 
Ms. ___ has a tracheostomy tube in place in the setting of 
chronic respiratory failure, and requires ventilator support at 
night. During the day, she uses a humidifier with 3L of 
supplemental oxygen. Per history provided by her son (who is her 
primary caregiver at home), Ms. ___ has had increased 
secretions over the last week and an out-patient chest x-ray on 
___ was concerning for potential right upper lobe pneumonia. 
However, on presentation to ___, there was no compelling 
radiographic or clinical evidence of pneumonia. Blood cultures 
and a MRSA screen were negative. She specifically had minimal 
secretions on tracheal suctioning, no leukocytosis on her 
complete blood counts, no fever, no hypotension, no tachycardia, 
and no radiographic evidence of pneumonia (although her lung 
apices were not well visualized on chest x-ray to 
kyphoscoliosis). Ms. ___ was continued on her home 
ipratropium and levalbuterol nebuliizer treatemetns, and 
fomoterol(home med). Her ventilator settings should remain at RR 
___, PEEP 5, TV 300 (reduced from 400cc at home, given her 
height and predicted tidal volume), and FiO2 30%

# History of UTIs
In the ED, the patient did not urinate but on the floor she has 
been incontinent of urine. She has a history of UTIs, and during 
a recent prior hospitalizations, on ___ she grew Klebsiella 
and was appropriately treated. She had another UTI while at home 
prior to this hospitalization which was treated empirically with 
cephalexin and then switched to Bactrim. Urinalysis here ___ 
was without evidence of acute cystitis, and while there was 
initial concern for urinary retention she began to void 
spontaneously prior to discharge, and did not have any more 
issues with retention while inpatient.

# ___ disease 
# Dementia
During her last admission, Ms. ___ had some episodes of 
agitation overnight and her outpatient neurologist Dr. ___ 
___ was consulted. At that time, he recommended an additional 
1.5 tabs of Sinamet as needed at 3AM for agitation. During that 
prior hospitalization, this medication change was noted to 
improve her agitation overnight. Her son says that she 
communicates with him, is normally oriented to person and place, 
and can speak with Passy-Muir valve. We continued Sinamet at her 
home doses this admission.

CHRONIC ISSUES 
==============
#B/l UE catheter associated DVT
She had bilateral upper extremity DVTs diagnosed in ___, 
with repeat US in ___ showing no evidence of DVT. Now that she 
has been treated for more than six months, she remains on 
enoxaparin prophylaxis, which we continued during this 
hospitalization (and on discharge). 

#Hypothyroidism: We continued her home levothyroxine. 

#Esophageal dysmotility: s/p PEG: We continued the Nutrition 
service's final tube feed recommendations from her last 
admission. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[] Follow up on respiratory secretions and respiratory status 
off of antibiotics
[] Continue to monitor for signs of urinary retention, consider 
outpatient urodynamic studies if persistently retaining.
[] Ventilator settings at discharge: RR 13, TV 300, PEEP 5, FiO2 
30%

IMAGING
========
___ CXR
Evaluation is limited due to low lung volumes and patient 
positioning with chin overlying the lung apices. Within these 
limitations: 
Tracheostomy is again seen. No large pleural effusion or obvious 
pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged and 
stable. Aortic arch atherosclerotic calcifications are again 
seen.  Obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm may be secondary to 
atelectasis, a developing infiltrate cannot be excluded. 
The apparent opacity in the right lower lung base is not 
visualized on repeat images and is likely due to overlying soft 
tissue, possibly the patient's arm. Deformities of the bilateral 
ribs, may be related to old fractures.

===================
___ year old woman with chronic respiratory failure s/p PEG/trach 
___ (nocturnally ventilated), chronic aspiration with PEG, 
dementia, advanced ___, HTN, HLD, and recent admission 
for a right fibula fracture, who presents with hypotension and 
diarrhea in the setting of C diff infection and UTI. Her 
hypotension was likely hypovolemic and rapidly improved with IV 
fluid resuscitation. She was treated with high-dose PO 
vancomycin and IV flagyl as well as IV ceftriaxone for her GNR 
UTI. Upon discharge, the patient was clinically improved with 
baseline blood pressures and decreased stool output.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
====================
[] Patient to complete PO vancomycin on ___ for total course 
of 14 days. Please ensure diarrhea has resolved following 
completion of this
[] Patient initiated on treatment for UTI and will be discharged 
with bactrim for 1 day for total 3 day course. Please ensure 
completion and resolution of UTI following this
[] Would recommend prophylactic PO vancomycin with future 
antibiotic courses to prevent recurrent C. diff

ACUTE ISSUES 
======================= 
# Diarrhea
# C difficile Infection
Patient presented with diarrhea over the past week unresponsive 
to PO vanc in the setting of known C diff infection. Although 
the number of daily stools has slowed down, the volume of the 
stools have been large. Given that she has had multiple c diff 
infections, she may be resistant to vancomycin. Stool cultures 
were sent. She was started on high dose PO vancomycin and IV 
flagyl. She was given IV fluids as below for GI losses. Her 
stool output decreased, her hypotension resolves, and she 
overall clinically was stable.

# Hypotension
Patient has blood pressures as low as ___ systolic in ED. BP was 
very responsive to fluid with no need for pressors. This was 
likely due to hypovolemia in the setting of fluid loss from 
diarrhea. Possibly, a compenent of SIRS response with C diff 
infection and UTI. No evidence of end organ damage based on 
initial labs. Blood pressures on discharge back to baseline.

# UTI
Patient with urine culture growing >100K GNR bacteria. The team 
was unable to assess symptoms given her mental status. 
Therefore, given concern for sepsis, she was treated with IV 
ceftriaxone.

# Chronic respiratory failure 
Patient has a tracheostomy and requires ventilator support at 
night. Patient has a history of frequent aspirations, with CXR 
appearing similar to baseline. She was continued on home 
ventilator settings. she was continued on home ipratropium, 
levalbuterol, and Perforomist.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for occasional wheezing and cough. There was 
concern for pneumonia but your chest X-ray did not show 
pneumonia and your symptoms quickly improved with nebulizers. 
Antibiotics were stopped and you tolerated this just fine. 
Overall, your presentation is most consistent with a post 
infectious bronchitis or asthma like syndrome.

You were evaluated by speech and language pathology who felt you 
would benefit from a ground diet with thin liquids to minimize 
your risks of accidentally inhaling some of your food when you 
eat (which can predispose to pneumonia and coughing fits).

You were deconditioned and had difficulty moving around and 
physical therapy recommended going to a rehab facility. You did 
not qualify for acute level rehab and so you and your family 
elected to go home with maximal services in order to work on 
getting stronger at home.

XR, L ankle XR negative for fracture. Initial CXR negative for 
acute intrathoracic pathology. 

While in the ED, the patient began to have labored respiration 
requiring O2 by NC. Per son had similar jerking movements with 
startling. Concern for aspiration as labored respriations 
occurred after patient eating meds with applesauce. Repeat CXR 
was stable. She was treated with NS and nebulizers. Her 
pressures were in the low ___ while sleeping, but after 
nebulizer treatment and sitting up her pressures were in the 
100s/70s. VBG 7.41/43/49/28, and lactate 1.8

====================
ECGStudy Date of ___  11:41:42 AM 
Clinical indication for EKG: R00.0 - Tachycardia 

Sinus tachycardia. First degree ___ block. Early precordial R 
wave
progression. Low voltage iin the precordial leads. Compared to 
the previoustracing of ___ tachcyardia is now present. Low 
voltage in the precordialleads is now present.

CT C Spine WO Contrast ___
1. No acute fracture identified. 
2. Severe cervical spondylosis with mild anterolisthesis of C2 
on C3 and C7 on 
T1.  Mild to moderate central canal narrowing without ___ 
stenosis. 
3. Anterior compression deformity of the T3 vertebral body is 
unchanged. 

CT Head ___
No acute intracranial abnormality. 

ANKLE (AP, MORTISE & LAT) LEFT  ___ 
No fracture.  Marked generalized demineralization.
 
PELVIS (AP ONLY)  ___
No fracture identified.  Marked generalized demineralization

KNEE (AP, LAT AND OBLIQUE) BILATERAL  ___  
No fracture.  Prominent osteoporosis 

CHEST (SINGLE VIEW)  ___
No acute intrathoracic abnormality.  Consider dedicated spine 
imaging if there is clinical concern for thoracic spinal 
fracture.
 
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) ___
Overall stable examination of the chest.

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW  ___spiration.

CHEST (PA & LAT) ___
The aorta is markedly unfolded and tortuous.  Heart remains 
upper limits of normal in size.  There is bilateral interstitial 
prominence which is not significantly changed since ___ and likely reflects underlying interstitial lung disease 
rather than interstitial edema.  The patient's mandible obscures 
the apices.  No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  No focal 
airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is an ___ year old woman with a history of 
___ disease, bilateral blindness, HTN, presenting after 
a fall and head strike without LOC at home, admitted with 
respiratory distress and hypoxia in the ED with rapid 
resolution. 

# Mechanical Fall:
Patient discharged on the same day as re presentation to the ED. 
On previous admission, patient noted by ___ to be at high fall 
risk and recommended acute rehab however son declined as pt not 
accepted to first choice rehab. Patient admitted after fall from 
chair, most likely mechanical in etiology, as he patient was 
startled and slipped to the ground and in the setting of her 
weakness and ___ was unable to stop he fall. There was 
no loss of consciousness to suggest syncope as the etiology.  
Overall picture not consistent with seizure activity, as there 
was no post ictal period, also no elevation in lactate noted on 
labs, and the patient ambulated after the event with the use of 
a walker. Imaging including CT C spine, CT Head, CXR, Pelvis XR, 
bilateral knee XR and L ankle XR without fracture or acute 
pathology. There were no focal neuro signs on exam. ___ was 
consulted who recommended disposition to rehab. She was 
discharged to ___.

# Respiratory distress/Aspiration
While in the ED the patient developed respiratory 
distress/labored respirations requiring NC. The etiology was 
concerning for aspiration as she had been eating her medications 
with applesauce prior to the event. A repeat CXR in the ED was 
negative for aspiration, but may have been premature to 
visualize any changes. The differential also included airway 
reactivity, given the recent admission for reactive airways. She 
was quickly weaned to room air with nebulizer treatments. Given 
the concern for mild respiratory distress a third CXR was done 
on the floor, again without any signs of infiltrate or acute 
pathology. There was evidence of mild volume overload and pt 
received 10mg IV lasix. On the previous admission the patient 
was evaluated by SLP who recommended a diet of ground solids and 
thin liquids. SLP was re consulted this admission, and the 
patient underwent a video swallow due to concerns for bedside 
aspiration, which revealed penetration and trace aspiration, and 
the patient was initiated on a diet of ground solids and nectar 
thickened liquids. She was also seen by nutrition who 
recommended supplementation with ensure plus TID. She was 
continued on atrovent and albuterol nebulizer treatmens, and 
fluticasone inhaler. Of note, albuterol was used cautiously as 
caused pt to become tachycardiac.

# Hyponatremia - RESOLVED
Patient with new mild hyponatremia to 130, with concomitant 
hypochloremia. Likely secondary to hypovolemia given improvement 
with IVF. 
 
# Coagulopathy Elevated PTT - RESOLVED
Patient with newly elevated PTT on admission. On recent 
admission patient appears to have been on heparin 5000 U TID, 
though patient is of normal BMI, likely the etioloy of the 
elevated PTT. No concomitant elevation in INR, no 
thrombocytopenia to suggest DIC. No history of elevated PTT in 
the past to suggest the presence of an acquired or intrinsic 
inhibitor. Resolved with holding subC heparin. The patient was 
restarted on subC heparin for VTE prophylaxis with BID dosing 
without elevation in PTT

CHRONIC ISSUES
===============
# ___ disease: Stable. The patient was continued on home 
rasagiline, ___ and carbidopa dosing.

# Hypertension: Stable. The patient continued home metoprolol 
succinate 12.5 mg daily.

# Hyperlipidemia: Stable. The patient continued home 
atorvastatin.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

It was a pleasure caring for you during your stay at ___. You 
were admitted to the hospital after a fall at home. Imaging of 
your head, neck, chest, pelvis, knees and ankle did not reveal 
any signs of fracture or bleeding. In the ED you had some 
shortness of breath and were admitted to the hospital. Your 
breathing improved rapidly with breathing treatments, and you 
were feeling much better by discharge. You had chest x rays 
which did not show any infection or fluid in your lungs. 

You had a video swallow study done, and the speech and language 
pathology experts recommended that you continue on a diet of 
ground foods and nectar thickened liquids to help prevent 
inhaling food when you eat (which can predispose you to 
infection)

You were evaluated by physical therapy and there were signs that 
you were deconditioned and had difficulty moving. They 
recommended that you go to a rehab facility.

Your updated medication list is included in your discharge 
paperwork. You will need to follow up with your primary care 
doctor within 1 week of discharge.

We Wish You The Best!

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old single Caucasian man with reported history 
of depression s/p one psychiatric hospitalization in ___ ___ for depression and suicidal ideation, 
history of intermittent cannabis use, who presented to ___ via 
EMS after his roommates were concerned for several hours of 
bizarre behaviors. ED course was notable for agitation with 
patient requiring mechanical and chemical restraints. 
. 
Initial presentation was concerning for severe psychosis with 
apparent acute onset (per collateral was seen by his parents 
about a week prior to presentation and appeared to be at his 
baseline) with ED course notable for grandiosity, irritability,
disorganized and tangential thought process, as well as 
agitation requiring numerous physical and chemical restraints. 
Interview on my examination was significantly more reassuring, 
with patient notably calm, cooperative with thought process that 
is linear, goal and future oriented. Of note, he denies AVH and 
he does not appear to be responding to internal stimuli. 
. 
In terms of etiology, presentation seems most consistent with 
substance induced psychosis, although the patient denies recent 
illicit substance use and his tox screen was negative on 
admission. Differential also includes brief psychotic disorder, 
bipolar disorder (although no clear history of mania in the 
past-- remains on the differential given young age with ?family 
history of bipolar). Has reportedly been depressed in the past, 
but denies depressive symptoms on examination and does not 
appear dysthymic or dysphoric on examination.

control with resolution of psychotic symptoms with consistent 
denial of SI/HI, he did not meet 7&8b criteria and was 
discharged upon expiration of his ___.

and future oriented. He was calm, cooperative on examination 
with full range of affect, consistently denying AVH with no 
evidence that he was responding to internal stimuli. 
- Patient was counseled to avoid using illicit drugs, including 
cannabis, as this may increase his risk for a recurrent episode 
of psychosis. The patient understood this risk and stated he 
would abstain.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female admitted to the hospital with  abdominal 
pain, nausea, and elevated white blood cell count.  Upon 
admission, the patient was made NPO, given intravenous fluids, 
and underwent imaging which showed perforated appendicitis. She 
was started on a course of antibiotics ceftriaxone and flagyl 
and underwent serial abdominal examinations. 

The patient was taken to the operating room on HD # 3 where she 
underwent a laparoscopic appendectomy.  Intra-operative findings 
were notable for acute perforated appendicitis with phlegmon and 
an abscess.  There was a 100 cc blood loss.  The patient was 
extubated after the procedure and monitored in the recovery 
room.  

During the post-operative course, she was febrile with an 
elevated white blood cell count. Her surgical pain was 
controlled with intravenous analgesia. Because of the 
temperature spikes, the patient underwent a cat scan of the 
abdomen on POD #5 and she was reported to have a right lower 
quadrant collection.  She was taken to interventional radiology 
where a drain was placed. Her abdominal pain persisted and she 
underwent another cat scan of the abdomen which showed an 
additional fluid collection posterior to the uterus.  She 
returned to ___ on POD #11 where another drain was placed.  Over 
the next ___ hours her white blood cell count began to normalize. 
 She continued on her course of ceftriaxone and flagyl.  

The patient was discharged home on POD #14.  Her antibiotics 
were discontinued and her white blood cell count was stable at 
11. She was transitioned to oral analgesia and was voiding 
without difficulty.  She had return of bowel function.  Her 
vital signs were stable and she was afebrile.  Discharge 
instructions were reviewed and questions answered.  A follow-up 
appointment was made in the Acute care clinic.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Of note, during the patient's hospitalization, she noted a left 
leg lesion.  The Dermatology service was consulted and advised 
removal of the lesion.  An appointment was made for follow-up by 
the Dermatology service.   They will call the patient with the 
time and place of the appointment.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain and found 
to have a perforation in your appendix. You were given IV 
antibiotics but continued to have pain and signs and symptoms of 
infection. You were taken to the operating room to have your 
appendix removed laparoscopically, and the infection washout out 
of your abdomen. After surgery, you continued to an elevation in 
your white blood cell count.  On imaging, you were reported to 
have fluid collections in your abdomen for which drains were 
placed.  Since then, your white blood cell count and your pain 
has decreased.  You continue on antibiotics.  Your are preparing 
for discharge home with ___ services for drain care assistance 
with the following instructions:

Please follow up at the appointment in clinic listed below. We 
also generally recommend that patients follow up with their 
primary care provider after having surgery. We have scheduled an 
appointment for you listed below.
ACTIVITY:
 
Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
You may climb stairs. 
You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until you 
see your surgeon at your next visit.
Don't lift more than ___ lbs for ___ weeks. (This is about the 
weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies to 
lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming.
 
HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
You may feel weak or ""washed out"" a couple weeks. You might want 
to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during surgery.
You could have a poor appetite for a couple days. Food may seem 
unappealing.
All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go 
away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your 
incisions. Under these dressings you have small plastic bandages 
called steristrips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks. 
(These are the thin paper strips that might be on your 
incision.) But if they fall off before that that's okay.
Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This is 
normal.
You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.
Do not use any ointments on the incision unless you were told 
otherwise.
You may see a small amount of clear or light red fluid staining 
your dressing or clothes. If the staining is severe, please call 
your surgeon.
You may shower. As noted above, ask your doctor when you may 
resume tub baths or swimming.
 
YOUR BOWELS:
Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain 
medicaitons. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as 
Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of 
magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain moving 
the bowels, call your surgeon. 
 
PAIN MANAGEMENT:
It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal 
surgery. This pain is often described as ""soreness"". 
Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain is 
getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.
You will receive a prescription for pain medicine to take by 
mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed. Do not 
take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take more 
medicine at one time than prescribed. Do not drink alcohol or 
drive while taking narcotic pain medication.
Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your 
pain gets too severe.
Talk with your surgeon about how long you will need to take 
prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain 
medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your 
surgeon has said its okay.
If you are experiencing no pain, it is okay to skip a dose of 
pain medicine.
Remember to use your ""cough pillow"" for splinting when you cough 
or when you are doing your deep breathing exercises.
If you experience any of the following, please contact your 
surgeon:
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours
- pain that is getting worse over time
- pain accompanied by fever of more than 101
- a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain
 
MEDICATIONS:
Take all the medicines you were on before the operation just as 
you did before, unless you have been told differently.
If you have any questions about what medicine to take or not to 
take, please call your surgeon.
 
DANGER SIGNS:
Please call your surgeon if you develop:
- worsening abdominal pain
- sharp or severe pain that lasts several hours
- temperature of 101 degrees or higher
- severe diarrhea
- vomiting
- redness around the incision that is spreading
- increased swelling around the incision
- excessive bruising around the incision
- cloudy fluid coming from the wound
- bright red blood or foul smelling discharge coming from the 
wound
- an increase in drainage from the wound

You will also need to follow-up with Dermatology to have 
excision of lesion left lower leg.

You are now doing better, tolerating a regular diet and ready to 
be discharged home to continue your recovery.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
TEE/cardioversion
 
History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo with PMH significant for HTN, 
presenting with a week long history of shortness of breath and 
dyspnea on exertion.  On presentation, she denied any chest 
pain, back pain, N/V, abdominal pain, HA, dizziness or 
peripheral edema. She has baseline DOE over the past few years 
and has been limiting her activity because of this.  She had 
been stable over the last few months but a few days ago noted 
increasing DOE.  She is having trouble walking any distance at 
all.  She has been using more of her Albuterol inhaler because 
of this.  She denies any new cough, URI symptoms or 
palpitations.  Other than feeling breathless, she has no other 
symptoms.
 
In the ED, initial vitals were  T 97.2 P ___ BP 123/65 RR 22 
SaO2 93% on RA. While in the ED, around 12:30pm the patient was 
tachycardic to 160.  Her EKG showed atrial fibrillation with 
RVR.  Her blood pressure at that time was stable with SBP of 
102/80 and O2 sats in high ___.  Patient was given 15mg IV 
Diltiazem with improvement in tachycardia to 90.  Her heart rate 
then increased back to about ~150 as the drug washed out.  She 
was given diltiazem 30mg PO.  She was offered outpatient 
management but chose admission.  

On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, 
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, hemoptysis, 
black stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or 
rigors. She has a chronic non-productive cough. She denies 
N/V/D, dysuria. All of the other review of systems were 
negative.

___ CHEST X-RAY
FINDINGS:  This examination is underpenetrated, accentuating 
density of the parenchyma. Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Low 
lung volumes accentuate heart size and pulmonary vasculature 
howevere there is no overt fluid overload. Lungs are clear.  
There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
  
IMPRESSION:  No cardiopulmonary abnormality on this 
underpenetrated study. 

___ TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal 
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall 
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally 
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an anterior 
space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. 

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular 
cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic 
function. No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.

___ TRANSESOPHAGEAL ECHOCARDIOGRAM
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of 
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right 
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen 
by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in 
the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are 
mildly thickened. There are filamentous strands on the aortic 
leaflets consistent with Lambl's excresences (normal variant). 
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: No intracardiac thrombus. Mild ___ regurgitation. 

  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo female presenting with dyspnea on exertion found with new 
onset symptomatic Afib with RVR and signs of volume overload.

# New onset Afib w/RVR: Pt presenting with shortness of breath 
and dyspnea on exertion which has acutely worsened over the week 
prior to admission. Pt thought to be in Afib for >48 hours upon 
presentation, outside of the window for cardioversion without 
TEE. Pt describes months of episodic dyspnea on exertion, 
self-treated as asthma with albuterol inhaler, but were perhaps 
possibly ___ paroxysms of Afib. Rate was not controlled on max 
dose diltiazem 15 mg/hr and metoprolol 400mg daily. She was 
bridged with heparin to a therapeutic INR on warfarin and 
underwent TEE/cardioversion with successful converstion to sinus 
rhythm. However, after cardioversion, pt developed >4.5 sec 
sinus pauses and bradycardia to ___. For this reason, she was 
not discharged on a beta blocker. She was set up to have an 
event monitor, with a plan to start low dose metoprolol 
succinate if she no longer has sinus pauses. INR was 3.6 on day 
of discharge; pt was prescribed warfarin 1mg, with instructions 
to hold the warfarin until INR check at ___ 
___ clinic on the day after discharge. 

# sinus pauses: occurred overnight after cardioversion, >4.5 
sec, asymptomatic. Unclear if these pauses occurred while 
patient was lying supine; she was not wearing CPAP at the time. 
Differential includes OSA vs. excessive nodal blockade vs. sick 
sinus syndrome. Pt has a history of non-compliance with CPAP and 
was counseled on the importance of CPAP for preventing sinus 
pauses and ectopy that could re-initiate her atrial 
fibrillation. Betablockade was held as above. Pt observed for 24 
hours while compliant with CPAP and did not have significant 
sinus pauses. She was arranged to have event monitor for ___ 
weeks, and to follow up with Dr. ___ in one month to monitor 
for further sinus pauses while off the beta blocker.

# orthopnea: CXR with vascular congestion. Pt likely with flash 
pulmonary edema ___ tachyarrythmia. Echo showed preserved 
systolic function, suboptimal images, could not comment on PA 
pressure. Given hives to HCTZ, a sulfa-moeity, initially avoided 
lasix in favor of ethacrynic acid, however net even with this 
agent. Ultimately diuresed with lasix IV without skin reaction, 
and orthopnea resolved. Pt still with baseline dyspnea on 
exertion. 

# Leukocytosis: Pt afebrile without focal infection signs. 
Leukocytosis persisted for 3 days; UA positive however culture 
grew mixed flora suggesting fecal contaminant. Leukocytosis 
resolved after removal of foley and 3 day course of ceftriaxone. 


# HTN: Home atenolol and amlodipine held while titrating nodal 
agents. Pt discharged on home dose of amlodipine but held beta 
blockade as above.

# OSA: Patient intermittently uses CPAP at home. Encouraged use 
and educated on importance of CPAP. Pt observed to be compliant 
towards the end of the admission.

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure to take care of you during your stay at ___. 
You came in with shortness of breath and were found to have an 
abnormal fast heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation. We were 
unable to slow down your heart rate with medicines, so we 
scheduled you for an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) 
which showed no clot, and then shocked the heart. This 
successfully converted your heart back to normal rhythm. 

You had a little extra fluid on your body from your heart not 
pumping efficiently while it was in Afib. We diuresed you with 
lasix and will be sending you home a small dose of lasix 20mg to 
take daily at home.

After the conversion, you had some very long pauses of your 
heart beat. Because of this we want you to wear a heart rhythm 
monitor for ___ weeks at home, to make sure you are not having 
more pauses, and also monitor if you go back into Afib. ___ 
___ will be in touch with you about this heart monitor, 
which you will receive at home in the mail within 3 business 
days.

We discussed the importance of wearing your CPAP to prevent 
converting back to Afib, and also to prevent the pauses we 
observed. Talk to your PCP about getting reconnected to a sleep 
center to keep your CPAP machine maintained and make sure you 
have the best-fitting mask.

When people are in atrial fibrillation, they are at risk of 
developing clots in the heart, which can break off and cause a 
stroke. To prevent this risk, you will need to take a blood 
thinner called warfarin, in case you go back into atrial 
fibrillation.  You will have to get your INR (a measure of how 
thin your blood is) checked regularly with the ___ 
clinic at ___ to make sure you are on the right 
dose of warfarin. You should get your INR checked tomorrow, 
___.

Chief Complaint:
events concerning for seizure
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

 
History of Present Illness:
___ year old right handed man with MS complicated by PML
while on Tysabri followed by ___ presenting with report of
possible seizures on Keppra 1250 mg BID. Patient reports 
episodes
in question started about one month ago, for the last week
occurring daily. Patient is followed by outpatient neurologist
Dr. ___ (cell ___. History is obtained from
patient, patient's girlfriend of ___ years in person (though
currently separated), and Dr. ___ phone. 

Patient and girlfriend report that patient diagnosed with MS in
___ in the setting of left eye decreased vision and right sided
weakness. Patient maintained on Tysabri for years until 
developed
PML in ___, per current primary neurologist Dr. ___ was followed by ___. Patient was referred to Dr. ___
he developed PML. Per report had a right frontal lesion, had
initially slight cognitive deficits then became overtly frontal,
then improved somewhat. 

Patient reports that previously his MS was largely characterized
by fatigue but that during this period he was diffusely quite
weak, very ill, hospitalized for four months. Around this time
patient reports that he had about 4 episodes of staring, being
unresponsive for ___ minutes spread out over time (months in
between). At some point over this time patient was started on
Keppra 1000 mg BID, and he was maintained on this dose until
about a month ago. 

About a month ago patient began experiencing different episodes.
He reports that these seem to start on the inside of his right
thigh with stiffening and cramping, then stiffening and low
amplitude shaking of bilateral lower extremities, shoulders, and
possibly arms, as well. Patient reports that when this happens 
he
will grab on to the railing of his bed. Sometimes patient 
reports
he has preserved awareness during and tries to keep track of the
clock (he thinks at times that he maintains awareness throughout
the entire episode but does, of note, have baseline short-term
memory difficulties). Other times patient will lose awareness 
and
come to holding onto the bed rail. The episodes typically last
___ minutes and are followed by patient being confused, tired,
sore, out of it for about 10 minutes or so, resting and getting
his bearings. Per report patient's son has witnessed several of
these episodes and has been unable to get father to respond
during. Patient reports son will try to put pressure on his
extremities to stop them from shaking and that this possibly
helps. 

Patient and girlfriend report that when these new episodes
started patient went to an OSH ED (possibly ___,
also possibly ___ at least at one point) in the
setting of an episode of unresponsiveness, not knowing where he
was or who he was (unclear if this was following one of the
shaking spells). At that time Keppra was increased to 1250 mg 
BID
and then about two weeks later to 1500 mg BID. Per patient the
episodes seemed better on 1500 mg BID, had seemed to quiet down,
so Keppra was weaned to 1250 mg BID. Per patient neurologist Dr.
___ on the phone, these episodes seemed to be better controlled
on Keppra 1500 mg BID but patient had cognitive slowing so was
decreased back to 1250 mg BID. Patient denies side effects on
Keppra 1500 mg BID and does not recall having had cognitive
slowing. 

Over the past week, patient reports he is now having these
shaking spells about daily, some days more than once. 

Per Dr. ___ had considered starting Lamictal given patient
per report with preserved awareness (at least when episodes
start) and also with known per report right frontal lesion
thought ___ PML (suggesting possibly focal seizures). However,
given increasing frequency of episodes, was concerned about
starting a medication requiring slow uptitration. As such,
referred patient to ___ ED for possible medication adjustment
and evaluation (including possible EEG) in the setting of these
frequent and prolonged spells. 

Patient reports that he has never had an EEG. Reports that his
last MRI was two weeks ago. 

Reports baseline difficulties thinking and speaking 
(particularly
with short term memory often repeating himself and with reading 
-
reports that this takes significant effort and is slow); patient
and girlfriend estimate that this has been about stable since 
his
PML.

Also reports baseline slightly decreased vision in the left eye,
left facial weakness, left greater than right extremity weakness
(reports that was initially weak on the right around the time of
MS diagnosis but then became more weak on the left with PML,
especially weak in the left hand), baseline muscle spasms and
cramping, spasticity throughout but particularly in his right
lower extremity. 

At baseline patient walks short distances with a walker, uses a
manual chair for longer distances. Typically does ___ (previously
twice per week then spaced to weekly). Has not had ___ in over 5
weeks given he gets this through ___ and ___ 
is
currently on ___ break. Reports increasing tightness, muscle
cramping, spasms in the setting of not getting his ___. Also
normally tries to walk outside if possible, is not possible in
the ___. Son does stretch patient night but still has noticed
recent worsening of spasms and tightness. 

Episodes per report typically consist of whole body shaking, at
times with preserved awareness, lasting ___ minutes. Also with
staring spells, per report he is conscious during but reports he
is unable to respond. 

Patient is current maintained on Copaxone (M, W, F - unknown
dose) as well as maraviroc for ___, likely to wean off 
maraviroc
in the near future.  

Reports right shoulder radiating to the elbow and then back
across his chest while sitting or lying certain ways for about
the past two weeks. 

No recent illnesses. Denies recent vision changes, diplopia,
vertigo, dizziness, tinnitus, hearing difficulty, new weakness,
new numbness apart from the intermittent right
arm/chest/shoulder. Denies recent changes in cognition. 

Denies recent fevers, cough, congestion, shortness of breath,
chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain, constipation, 
diarrhea,
rashes. Endorses baseline thirst, dry mouth, and significant
diaphoresis to the point that he drinks 72 ounces of water 
before
bed nightly and wears a condom catheter overnight. Sleeps about
___ hours each night. Needs to take nighttime medications to 
have
muscle spasms and discomfort under control to be able to sleep. 

Endorses low mood, feeling like he is not adding anything.

OTHER DIAGNOSTICS
=================
EEG - ___
This is continuous EEG recording captures one pushbutton 
activation for right shoulder shrugging, and variable right arm, 
torso and head tremors which last for one minute and has no 
electrographic correlate; consistent with a psychogenic 
non-epileptic event (PNES). Otherwise the background activity is 
normal and a well-organized 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm is 
seen. There are no seizures or epileptiform discharges. 

EEG - ___
This is continuous EEG recording that captured two pushbutton 
activations where there was no electrographic correlate. The 
background 
activity is normal. No focal, lateralized or epileptiform 
discharges were 
seen. 

EEG - ___
This is a normal continuous ICU monitoring study. There are no 
pushbutton activations. There are no electrographic seizures or 
epileptiform discharges. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ M w PMHx MS ___ PML / ___ (R 
frontal lesion) and suspected seizures (staring spells, on 
keppra) who is admitted for characterization for a new spell 
type (severe painful R thigh spasm followed by whole body 
spasms, no LOC during event per patient but sleepy/confused/weak 
after, occurring multiple times per day). 
He was hooked up to cvEEG and multiple stereotypical ""spasm"" 
spells were captured. There was no electrographic correlate. On 
video, spells appear more consistent with PNES than pain 
reactions or muscle spasms. 
His home LEV was then discontinued in an attempt to capture his 
other spell semiology (""staring""). Despite this, no spells were 
captured over several days. Keppra was re-started at discharge 
given staring spells were not captured and patient is at risk 
for seizures.

IMAGING/STUDIES
===============
CTA CHEST ___
Limited by respiratory motion.  No evidence of pulmonary 
embolism to the 
segmental level or aortic abnormality. 

TTE ___
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal 
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be 
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is 
low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The right ventricular free wall is 
hypertrophied. with borderline normal free wall function. There 
is abnormal septal motion/position (there is an intermittent 
septal bounce that is nonspecific. Can be seen in constrictive 
pericarditis, but there is no other clear evidence for this 
including reduced e' velocities). The number of aortic valve 
leaflets cannot be determined. There is no aortic valve 
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is borderline pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which 
most likely represents a prominent fat pad. 
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Low normal global 
biventricular systolic function. Couldnt assess RV size well 
but may be mildly dilated. Borderline pulmonary hypertension. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___ 
global biventricular systolic function is less vigorous. 
Pulmonary pressures are lower but could be underestimated due to 
limited interrogation angles with poor image quality (patient 
could not roll over for the technologist).  

CT ABD/PELV ___
FINDINGS:    
LOWER CHEST: Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. 
There is no 
evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.   
ABDOMEN:  
HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation 
throughout.  
There is no evidence of focal lesions.  There is no evidence of 
intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.  The 
gallbladder is within normal limits.   
PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, 
without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal 
dilatation.  There is no peripancreatic stranding.   
SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, 
without 
evidence of focal lesions.   
ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size 
and shape.   
URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with 
normal nephrogram.  There is no evidence of focal renal lesions 
or hydronephrosis.  There is no perinephric abnormality.   
GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable.  Small bowel 
loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and 
enhancement throughout.  The colon and rectum are within normal 
limits.   
PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. 
 There is no free fluid in the pelvis.   
REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The visualized reproductive organs are 
unremarkable.  
LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric 
lymphadenopathy.  There 
is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.   
VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Mild 
atherosclerotic disease 
is noted.   
BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or 
acute fracture.  
Fixation hardware noted from L4-S1.   
SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal 
limits.   
IMPRESSION:    
No imaging findings to explain the patient's hematocrit drop.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with hx of Gold Stage IV COPD, hemorrhoidal bleeding, GERD, 
and HFrEF (EF 40%) who presents from pulmonary clinic in setting 
of severe COPD, FEV1/FVC 32% (FEV1 21% predicted), new anemia of 
unclear etiology. She was treated with steroids and discharged 
on a steroid taper. There was concern initially for COPD 
exacerbation but further history revealed she was near her 
baseline respiratory function. Her respiratory function was 
concerning for her home safety and after ___ evaluation, the 
decision was made to discharge her to rehabilitation ___. 
During her hospitalization, she was found to have anemia 
(baseline Hgb from ___ of 12, down to 9 on admission and 
stable at 8). Given significant change from baseline, concern 
for active blood loss anemia. Stool guaiac x 3 negative, CT A/P 
without evidence of acute bleed/retroperitoneal bleed. Likely, 
anemia secondary to hemorrhoid bleeding per history but Hgb 
remained stable throughout remainder of hospitalization and was 
stable at 8.7 on discharge. 

# Acute on chronic anemia - Hemoglobin of 7.9 ___ (stably low 
on subsequent repeats ___ was concerning given 
history of severe hemorrhoids and also upper GI symptoms 
(epigastric pain and nausea)/history of acute pancreatitis 
(lipase normal).  This may all have been ___ hemorrhoidal 
bleeding, though initial rectal guaiac NEG.  Upper GI source 
considered (may be hidden somewhat ___ severe constipation), 
especially in setting of complaints of epigastric pain and 
ongoing steroid treatment for COPD.  No signs of RP bleed on 
physical exam, abdominal exam benign.  CT Abd/pelv ___ with NO 
sign of intraabdominal bleed.  Hemolysis labs unremarkable.  
Iron studies consistent with Fe deficiency (Fe 45, Ferritin 9.1, 
Fe sat ~8%), started PO supplemental iron.  Reticulocyte index 
<2% suggesting marrow suppression, furthermore WBC count quite 
low despite treatment with high dose steroids.  Patient with 
history of multiple SBOs, ?malabsorption, B12 equivocal at 334, 
together with Fe deficiency may have caused a normocytic 
anemia/cytopenias.  Started B12 supplementation at time of 
discharge.  After giving aggressive bowel regimen ___, patient 
had several BMs, the last of which this AM was mixed with red 
blood, most likely bleeding internal hemorrhoids.  Given that Hb 
was stable (8.4->8.7), patient cleared for discharge with close 
outpatient follow-up with her PCP to monitor CBC.        
- Pantoprazole 40mg BID
- Supplemental Iron
- Supplemental B12
- Continue bowel regimen as outpatient to prevent constipation 
leading to increased straining/worsening hemorrhoids

hematopoietic elements that are left shifted. Rare focal 
atypical myeloid blasts and left shifted myeloid elements are 
present.  Immunohistochemistry for CD34 and CD117 reveal about 
___ of marrow cells as precursor blasts. Since residual CML 
cannot be frequently distinguished from normal hematopoiesis, 
correlation with cytogenetics (OCA: other chromosomal 
abnormalities), BCR-ABL transcript levels and BAMA (bcr-abl 
mutation analysis) is recommended.

Imaging:
CXR ___:
FINDINGS: Normal lung volumes. Moderate cardiomegaly. No 
evidence of

thoracoabdominal
aorta and its major branches, and the coronary arteries

TTE 
___:
 The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are 
normal (LVEF >55%). Doppler parameters are indeterminate for 
left ventricular diastolic function. There is no ventricular 
septal defect. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with history of CML with new fatigue who was found to have 
severe anemia and elevated WBC on cbc done today in workup for 
possible transplant.  Patient became febrile after admission to 
the hospital.

# Accelerated phase CML: Patient was anemic on admission and 
transfused.  It was decided that patient should undergo 
myeloablative induction for possible allogeneic stem cell 
transplant.  Patient started induction chemotherapy on ___ 
with cytarabine and idarubicin (7+3) according to protocol.  Her 
dasatinib was held.  Her ANC nadir was ___. Her course was 
complicated by fevers for which she was started on vancomycin 
and cefepime and her PICC line was removed.  Blood cultures, 
urine cultures and stool cultures remained negative. She 
developed a diffuse rash, and dermatology was consulted.  It was 
felt that this may have been a drug rash related to cefepime, 
vancomycin or hydralazine and she was treated with topical 
steroids.  Hydralazine and cefepime were stopped and aztreonam 
was started.  She spiked a temperature of 101 on ___ and 
aztreonam was changed to meropenem.  She defervesced and 
remained afebile for the remainder of her hospitalization.  
Cultures remained negative.  Her ___ recovered to 1829 on 
___.  A pre transplant work up was completed as an inpatient, 
including infectious disease consultation and dental 
consultation.

# History of CAD: Patient was continued on her home dose of 
statin.  She was ruled out for myocardial infarction with serial 
cardiac biomarkers.  Her metoprolol was uptitrated during this 
admission due to hypertension and she was discharged on 100 mg 
PO tid. 

# HTN: Patient was initially started on her home dose of 
metoprolol.  She had several episodes of elevated blood pressure 
and her metoprolol was uptitrated to 100mg PO tid.  She was 
started on hydralazine, but it was later stopped ___ drug rash.  
She was started on valsartan 80mg PO daily, with improved 
control of her blood pressure.

# Pancytopenia: After treatment with 7+3, patient was 
periodically transfused with PRBCs to maintain her hematocrit 
above 25 and platelets to maintain her platelets above 10.  
 
# FEN: Neutropenic diet, Mg, K and Phos were repleted by 
protocol.

Brief Hospital Course:
#. Accelerated Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia: Patient was 
treated with busulfan/cytoxan conditioning per protocol.  She 
experienced some nausea and emesis which was controlled with 
zofran.  Stem cell transplant was performed. Her course was 
complicated by neutropenic fever and she was treated with 
antibiotics. She remained culture negative. She developed 
esophagitis and was found to be negative for CMV but esophaheal 
biopsy suggested esophageal GHVD and also had evidence of skin 
GHVD. She received a tapered course of steroids and improved. 
She also developed intense headaches while she was 
thrombocytopenic. Head CT showed no acute intracranial 
hemorrhage or mass effect, with a few vague dense areas noted in 
the brainstem/posterior fossa, likely being artifactual. Her 
headaches resolved. She was discharged to the oncology 
apartments and will follow closely with the ___ and 
her primary oncologist.
.
#. Hypertension.  On admission, patients metoprolol was 
continued but her valsartan was held out of concern for renal 
toxicity with chemotherapy.  Her blood pressure trended up 
during her conditioning and her metoprolol dose was increased. 
Subsequently nifedipine was also added and she was discharged on 
nifedpine and metoprolol with good blood pressure control. She 
had serial EKGs performed given her cardiac history, and her 
cardiac status should continue to be monitored as an outpatient.

#N/V/D: the pt p/w reported having several loose stools and 
sporadic vomiting throughout the past week prior to 
presentation. She also reported decreased po intake since 
___ with accompanying nausea/vomiting. Additionally, pt had 
hx suggestive of upper GI GVHD. She was started empirically on 
methylprednisolone 30 mg IV BID, in addition to her Budensonide 
3 mg PO TID, and cyclosporine 125 mg IV q12 for possible GVH 
colitis. Zofran and omeprazole were ordered for her 
nausea/vomiting.  Stools were sent for o&p, bact cultures, viral 
cultures, and clostridium difficile toxin.  Due to her 
continuing diarrhea, CT abdomen done on HD3 which showed 
uncomplicated ileocolitis with continuous involvement of distal 
ileum up to proximal transverse colon just beyond the hepatic 
flexure, suggestive of graft versus host disease or 
infectious/inflammatory etiologies.  The pt. was placed NPO on 
HD3 for colonoscopy, but given her poor PO intake while in the 
hospital, was evaluated and started on TPN by HD4.   While on 
the high dose steroids, the pt's diarrhea did not improve much, 
and she wast started on empiric abx therapy with metronidazole  
500 mg IV qday and levofloxacin 750 mg IV qday (as she was 
allergic to cefepime/possibly penicillins) on HD4.  Stool 
studies all came back negative for infectious etiologies of her 
diarrhea.  Bx results from her colonoscopy were negative for CMV 
but positive for severe graft versus host colitis throughout the 
colon.  Her antibiotics were discontinued, and she was started 
on mycophenolate mofetil 1000 mg po BID and her cyclosporine was 
increased from 175 mg po BID to ___ qAM/qHS.  Her 
diarrhea began to improve, TPN was dc'd on HD 9, and she was 
discharged home on HD12 on CSA, MMF, and IV methylprednisolone 
for control of her GVH colitis.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital due to nausea, vomiting, and 
diarrhea for several days duration.  You had a CT scan of you 
abdomen which showed inflammation.  You were given medications 
for a possible infection in your colon for several days, as well 
as medications for possible Graft Versus Host Disease of the 
colon.  You were evaluated by colon specialists 
(gastroenterologists) who performed a procedure to look at the 
inside of you colon and take biopsies (colonoscopy).  It was 
determined that your diarrhea was NOT from an infection, but due 
to Graft-Versus-Host-Disease (a complication that can happen in 
people with allogenic stem cell transplants).  You were placed 
on large doses of immunosuppressants (Methylprednisolone, 
Cyclosporin, Mycophenolate Mofetil, and Budenoside) to stop your

         This organism may develop resistance to third 
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore, 
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within 
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious 
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with CML, s/p allogeneic SCT D 163 (on discharge) with 
post-transplant period complicated by upper and lower GI GVH 
(biopsy ___, s/p treatment with steroids, currently on 
cyclosporin 50 in am, 25 in pm and atovaquone, who presents with 
persistent nausea, vomitting, and diarrhea. Anemic on 
presentation and transfused 2 units of RCC and following a 
seemingly inadequate response on lab tests received a further 2 
units. Started on IV methylprednisolone for ? GVHD and converted 
to an oral steroid taper. Cyclosporin level increased due to low 
level. Deranged LFTs noted and will be repeated in community. 
Found to have an enterobacter UTI and commenced on a 3 days 
course of oral levofloxacin.
.
#Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea: Presented with 5 days of 
symptoms which were improving on admission. For concerns of GVHD 
(see previous history) she was started on IV methylprednisolone 
30mg bid and this was converted to an oral prednisone taper 
following resolution of symptoms by the day after admission. PRN 
ondansetron for nausea. She was found to have moderate LeukE on 
UA although there were only 3WBCs on urine microscopy. She was 
commenced on a 3-day course of oral levofloxacin for her UTI 
(note sensitive to ciprofloxacin on sensitivity testing). Stool 
cultures were negative.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old woman with CML, s/p MRD allo SCT ___ with 
Busulfan/Cyclophosphamide. Her post-transplant course was 
complicated with GVH of the upper and lower GI tract that 
required hopitalization for IV steroids and increased 
immunosuppression. She was admitted for investigation of 
worsening LFTs. She was treated with high dose IV 
methylprednisolone, oral Mycophenolate mofetil and increasing 
cyclosporin doses. She quickly developed symptoms suggestive of 
GI GVHD with cramping ___ pain, nausea and vomiting. LFTs 
worsened during admission but she did not necessitate a liver 
biopsy due to considerable improvement in these following 
increased immunosuppression. The general picture was that of 
severe multi-organ GVHD. Her GI symptoms worsened with abdominal 
pain and profuse watery diarrhea and she had a CT scan which 
demonstrtaed confluent small bowel enteritis. At this point she 
was placed on bowel rest and administered TPN. GVHD was 
confirmed at endoscopy and biopsy where mucosa was noted to be 
friable and extensively ulcerated in keeping with severe GVHD. 
Her cyclosporin was titrated up and her symptoms improved 
although diarrhea persisted despite a considerable period of 
bowel rest on TPN. Her Hb/HCt had been slowly falling and her 
stool was found to be guaiac +ve felt likely 2o to her bowel 
inflammation. She was found to have a swollen left arm shortly 
after a PICC line was placed and there was evidence of an 
extensive LUE DVT extending to the subclavian vein. This was 
treated conservatively as anticoagulation was felt to be 
inadvisable in the setting of her continued bowel inflamation 
and guaiac +ve stools. Due to problmes of low cyclosporin levels 
her cyclosporina nd mycophenolate were changed to IV on ___. 
WBC count progressively dropped ? cause and she may need a bone 
marrow biopsy soon if her counts do not improve. She was 
continued on IV methylprednisolone mycophenolate and cyclosporin 
w/continued TPN for bowel rest. Blood glucoses high and 
titrating up insulin in TPN in addition to addingNPH low dose 
BID on ___. Gradually, diarrhea improved and pt was able to be 
transitioned slowly to PO medications. Levels of cyclosporin 
were monitored to ensure therapuetic range and absorptions. 
Slowly pt's diet was also advanced and at discharge pt was off 
TPN. Closes follow-up was planned on ___.
.
# Rising LFTs:  This was found to be liver GVHD.  Progressively 
settling following GVHD treatment. Mildly elevated on previous 
admission in week prior to current admission. She was initially 
asymptomatic although latterly developed severe diarrhea, nausea 
and vomiting. Her steroids initially oral prednisone were 
increased to IVMP 30mg bid and cyclosporin was gradually 
uptitrated. She had ___ U/S ___ which showed focal fatty 
infiltrate and nil else. Bil rose from 1.6 on ___ and 
transaminases were progressively rising. MRCP on ___ showed 
hemosiderosis of liver and spleen, thickening of duodenum and 
___ jejunum in keeping with inflammatory/infectious etiology 
and a small stone in GB. Seen by hepatology ___ and lab 
investigations for vit D,  Hep B/C/Adeno/CMV/HHV6/EBV PCRs, Hep 
A Ab, HSV Ab. These all came back -ve save vit D level which was 
low and seh was sterted on vitamin D supplementation. Put on 
bowel rest and started on TPN. Bil rose from 1.6 to 5.7 on ___ 
with improved transaminases. By repeat on ___ Bil level had 
dropped to 5.1 and by ___ Bil dropped to 2.9 with improved 
transaminases. She therefore did not go for liver bx. LFTs 
continued to trend down with high levels of immunosuppression. 
Slowly immunosuppression was titrated down and LFTs remained 
stable as diarrhea continued to improve. Transition to PO 
fluconazole resulted in rise in LFTs w/out evidence of other 
worsening GVHD symptoms so pt was restarted on home 
voriconazole. LFTs will continued to be monitored as meds are 
titrated on an outpt basis.
.
# CML: s/p allo SCT. She continues to recover from her 
transplant. Guaiac +ve stol ___ and transfused 1 unit 
___. Transfusion goal HCt >25 Plt >20. 
.
# GVHD ___ pain, nausea and  vomiting and elevated LFTs): 
Previous significant upper and lower GI GVHD. She ws found on 
this admission to again have severe GVHD in his case involving 
the small bowel and liver. On admission she was started on IV 
methylpred 30mg bid. Whilst she was asymptomatic on admission, 
she quickly developed abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting felt 
likely to be GVHD. Increased cyclosporin to 75mg bid, added 
mycophenolate 500mg bid and voriconazole 200mg bid on ___. 
Increased mycophenolate to 1g bid on ___. Cyclosporin 119 and 
increased cyclosporin to 100mg bid ___ then 125mg bid ___. As 
high level changed to 125/100 on ___. Cyclopsorin increased to 
125mg bid ___ and 150mg bid ___ due to persistently low 
levels and felt that this was likely due to poor absorption from 
the gut. SShe had suprapubic tenderness with diarrhea as of ___ 
- NOT peritonitic. Initially felt to be ? inadequately treated 
UTI (Enterobacter in UCx in week prior and Rx levo for 3 days). 
Rpt UA and UCx were -ve. Started on oral cipro ___.. Due to 
diarrhea was changed to IV cipro/metronidazole ___. MRI showed 
duodenitis/jejunitis ? infectious ? inflammatory. Supportive IV 
fluids where given and then TPN was started for nutritional 
support. High stool output. Seen by GI ___ who recommended 
stool studies which were negative. Changed Abx to IV meropenem 
___. ___ ___ showed small bowel enteritis 
encompassing most of small bowel with no dilatation. UGIE and bx 
___ showed abnormal, friable mucosa throughout approximately 
75% of the duodenum which was denuded with a shiny erythematous 
base and could be consistent with known history of GVHD. IV 
meropenem stopped ___. Awaiting CMV immunostaining. EBV 20 
copies and was repeated ___ and was not amplifyable although 
the sample was slightly hemolysed. She symptomatically improved 
although had persistent diarrhea despite bowel rest. She was 
treated with loperamide. Gradually symptoms improved and pt was 
able to be transition from IV meds to PO meds and diet advanced 
slowly while TPN continued until pt was able to tolerated PO 
diet at a sufficient level to maintain calorie needs. At time of 
d/c TPN had been stopped and pt was taking only POs.
.

# L UE DVT: Swollen L arm post PICC insertion. Had U/S and 
doppler ___ which showed edema but no hematoma or localised 
edema but repeat U/S showed Left Basilic DVT ___.  PICC was 
removed on ___. She did not receive anticoagulation given low 
Plts, guaiac +ve stool and significant ulceration on bx 
suggestive of continued significant bowel inflammation. Later pt 
had some intermittent residual swelling in the arm which was 
attibutated to mild edema because of lingering partial occlusion 
in the veins. Repeat US was negative at that time.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because of rising liver 
function tests and concern that you were experiencing GVHD 
(rejection symptoms). You had recently been admitted for nausea, 
vomiting, and diarrhea and had responded to immunosupressive. 
You were again admitted to help manage your symptoms by placing 
you on bowel rest, giving you IV forms of your medications and 
supporting you with IV nutrition. Your symptoms gradually 
improved and your diet was able to be slowly advanced. Your 
immunosupressive meds were also titrated to help prevent future 
flairs without oversuppresion of your immune system and bone 
marrow.

Imaging:

IMPRESSION: 
 CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 5:43 ___ 
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma. 
2. Left lower lobe consolidation with adjacent small left 
nonhemorrhagic 
pleural effusion. This finding is concerning for infection in 
the appropriate clinical setting. 
3. Increased attenuation of the liver, compatible with 
hemosiderosis, 
unchanged. 
4. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis. 
5. Extensive calcified atherosclerotic disease of the aorta and 
its branches without associated aneurysmal changes. 
6. Right thigh lipoma is partially imaged. 
.
EMG:
IMPRESSION: 
Abnormal study. There is electrophysiologic evidence for a 
myopathy with 
denervating (""inflammatory"") features, most severely affecting 
the lower 
extremities. The findings are not suggestive of an acquired 
demyelinating 
polyneuropathy, such as Guillain- ___ syndrome. 
.
ECHO ___: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial 
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated 
right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are 
normal (LVEF >55%). A mid-cavitary gradient is identified. There 
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the 
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, no 
change. 
.
CHEST CT: report pending at time of discharge
. 
PATHOLOGY:
Muscle biopsy, r4 rectus femoris muscle:
Inflammatory myopathy, see note.
Note: Section showed myofibers with prominent inflammatory 
infiltrate composed of foamy macrophages, lymphocytes, and 
plasma cells.  Degenerative and regenerative fibers are seen.  
In some areas, myofibers are replaced by adipose and connective 
tissue, consistent with a subacute clinical picture. CD3 labeled 
prominent T cell infiltrate with numerous CB8 positive cytotoxic 
and scattered CD4 positive helper cells, while CD20 labeled B 
lymphocytes are rare in perivascular zones. CD68 highlighted 
abundant macrophages, some involved in myophagocytosis. The 
findings would be consistent with GVH myositis in the clinical 
context of CML status post alloSCT and history of GI and liver 
GVH disease. GVH myositis is indistinguishable histologically 
from sporatic polymyositis. Further studies including 
biochemical panel will be reported as an addendum.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ female with CAD s/p CABG, accelerated phase CML s/p 
allo SCT ___ complicated by upper and lower GI GVHD ___ 
and liver GVHD ___ presenting from OSH electively intubated 
for hypoxic and hypercarbic failure in the setting of myopathy. 
.
# Hypercarbic hypoxic respiratory failure: Pt was initially 
electively intubated given diffuse myopathy affecting 
respiratory muscles. Pt was managed on endotracheal intubation 
for 11 days before being trached on ___. Her ___ NIF has 
remained (-14)-(-18). During trials on trach collar, she has 
maintained her oxygen saturation and respiratory rate, however 
her blood pressure elevates and she reports subjective feelings 
of dyspnea and fatigue. Goal now for weaning her from the vent 
is treatment of her diffuse myositis to improve respiratory 
failure in the long term with gentle weaning to trach collar.
.
# Motor weakness: Based on muscle biopsy, inflammation is 
consistent with GVHD.  Muscle biopsy shows impressive 
inflammation despite having been on steriods prior to biopsy. 
Muscle strength appeared to initially improve on steroids, 
though now has been stable x 1 week. Following muscle biopsy, 
she was started on cyclosporine 25mg IV BID and received 1 dose 
of IVIG. She has had minimal improvement in her strength and is 
aware that this will be a prolonged recovery process.
.
# Mold on BAL: Sparse growth seen on bronchial aspirate from 
___. Given clinical improvement and radiological improvement 
on CT scan ___, we do not feel that this is likely a pathogenic 
organism. We do recommend repeat CT chest in ___ weeks for 
continued monitoring. 
.
# depression: Ms ___ has started to appear overwhelmed and 
frustrated by her current condition and long term recovery that 
is necessary. We have deferred starting an SSRI but this should 
be reconsidered outside of an acute hospitalization.
.
# Pancytopenia: Developed in setting of starting cyclosporine. 
Her CBC has been stable and she has not required any recent 
transfusions. Threshold for transfusion would be platelets <10, 
hct <25
.
# bilateral hand bullae: First noticed on ___. Dermatology was 
consulted and felt that her purpura was due to trauma and her 
coagulopathy.  The bullae were probably the result of hemorrhage 
into thin skin. They were drained and per derm, continued with 
light pressure dressings to prevent re-accumulation.
.
# Hypertension: Pt has history of hypertension and had been 
managed at home on amlodipine 5mg, and metoprolol succinate 
300mg ___. These were initially held on presentation, but 
resumed as she improved clinically. She has been stable on 
amlodipine 5mg ___, metoprolol tartrate 100mg q6hr, and 
captopril 12.5mg TID. She has been noted to get hypertensive to 
170s when on trach collar. We would expect this to resolve as 
she becomes more comfortable on the trach collar and her 
strength improves. It would be possible to up titrate her 
captopril if she requires.
.
# DVT: Pt has bilateral DVT, however in setting of diffuse 
ecchymoses and hematomas, heparin drip was held. Pt had CTA at 
outside hospital to r/o PE and had an IVC filter placed.  She 
was placed on compression stockings to avoid further 
complications of thrombophlebitis.
.
# Elevated LFTs: LFT have been stably elevated during this 
hospitalization, likely secondary to her known GVHD.
.
# elevated PTT: Unclear etiology since patient has been off 
heparin drip for 1 week now. She is still getting heparin SQ TID 
and suspect that given decreased muscle mass, she may be 
supratheraputic from SQ heparin alone. Further work up is 
pending, including ___, anti-cardiolipin antibody, and 
anti-lupus antibody.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
.
# CML s/p allogeneic stem cell tx: Pt was continued on acyclovir 
and atovaquone for prophylaxis. She had been on budesonide, 
however this has been held recent as it cannot be given through 
her dobhoff. She has been started on cyclosporin and IVIG for 
diffuse myositis.
.
# CAD: s/p CABG in ___. Continued home medications. Repeat ECHO 
here showed no wall motion abnormalities. She also had cardiac 
catheterization at outside hospital for workup of initial 
presenting dyspnea which revealed clean coronary arteries.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
Pt is full code.
.
She will require repeat IVIG either ___ or ___ per 
rheumatology recs.
.
She should have repeat CT chest in ___ weeks for follow up on 
interval change in L infiltrate.
.
We have decreased her heparin SQ to BID given persistently 
elevated PTT. This should be re-evaluated if remains elevated 
and further work-up would be warranted.
.
We have resumed home blood pressure medications. If necessary, 
her captopril could be up titrated.
.
Patient and her husband are aware that she will have a prolonged 
recovery period. She has expressed some thoughts of depression 
and would likely benefit from an SSRI.
.
Tube feds currently Beneprotein, 21 gm/day, Goal rate: 40 ml/hr, 
Residual Check: q4h Hold feeding for residual >= : 200 ml
.
Pt has not been getting her budesonide as it clogs her dobhoff. 
This should be discussed with hem/onc at her follow up visit.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___. You were admitted for difficulty breathing and 
had a breathing tube placed to help. This was transitioned to a 
tracheostomy. You had a muscle biopsy done to determine what 
caused your weakness. It looks like your graft versus host 
disease caused damage to your muscle and affected your 
respiratory muscles. You were started on a new medicine called 
cyclosporin and got 1 dose of IVIG to treat the muscle weakness. 
You were also continued on steroids. There was some concern for 
a pneumonia, though this looks like it has resolved on your most 
recent CT scan. Your feeding tube was left in place for you to 
get adequate nutrition until your muscle strength improves.

We will send a complete list of your medications to the ___.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with a history of 
accelerated CML s/p allo-MRD SCT ___ complicated by GVHD of 
the liver, gut, myositis necessitating intubation due to 
respiratory muscle weakness.  She presented with worsening 
blood-streaked diarrhea and elevated LFTs, with hospitalization 
complicated by multiple DVTs and resulting BRBPR caused by 
heparin gtt, with BRBPR, and recurrent C. diff infection.
.
#. DIARRHEA: ___ GVHD and recurrent C diff. Patient has been 
having blood-streaked diarrhea since admission likely secondary 
to GVHD, which progressed to BRBPR with clots after starting 
heparin gtt for DVTs (see below). Heparin was discontinued, but 
patient with continued diarrhea. On ___ C. diff toxin was 
found positive. Pt has had multiple episodes of C diff in past, 
and prophylactic PO vanco had been discontinued on ___. She 
was started on IV flagyl on ___ for her positive C diff), then 
switched to vanco 500mg PO q6hrs per GI recs (used for recurrent 
c diff: 250-500mg PO q6hrs x14 days, then taper). Diarrhea 
progressively improved after this. Patient also has chronic gut 
and liver GVHD. She had EGD and colonoscopy on ___, which 
showed 2 whitish cecal plaques/nodules with biopsy showing focal 
active ileitis, rare apoptotic crypt cells in 
ileum/ascending/transverse colon consistent with (but not 
specific for) GVHD. Also had ileocecal valve nodules composed of 
""predominantly fibrinopurulent exudate consistent with ulcer and 
a very minute strip of surface epithelium"". EGD/colonoscopy 
biopsies were found negative for AFB, fungi, CMV, viruses. For 
her C diff, patient is discharged on Vancomycin 500mg PO q6 
hours for 14 days (first day = ___, last day = ___. After 
this, she should restart suppressive therapy: vancomycin 250mg 
q6 hours chronically. For her GVHD, she is discharged on 
prednisone 30mg by mouth daily, and cyclosporine 50mg by mouth 
twice daily. 
.
#. BRBPR: pt admitted with blood-streaked stools, found likely 
secondary to GVHD (confirmed by colonoscopy on ___. When 
heparin gtt was started for multiple ___ DVTs, patient developed 
frank BRBPR with clots. This resolved after discontinuing 
heparin gtt; patient guaiac negative afterward. She was started 
on enoxaparin 40mg BID for DVT prophylaxis with no ensuing 
complications.   
.
#. ELEVATED LFTs: Patient has known GVHD of the liver.  LFTs on 
admission showed elevated AST, ALT and Alk Phosph, found likely 
___s voriconazole, which she is taking for h/o

**Cyclosporine was increased/decreased/not changed....***
.
#. GVHD: manifested as gut, liver, and muscle GVHD. During 
hospitalization her cyclosporine was increased from 25mg BID to 
50mg BID as it was felt that her diarrhea on presentation was 
from GVHD. Her prednisone was decreased to 30mg by mouth daily. 
Due to her muscle GVHD (diagnosed by rheumatology), patient is 
extremely weak in her ___ flexor muscles. She will continue 
physical therapy at rehab. She was also incidentally found to 
have diffuse airway narrowing consistent with possible early 
bronchiolitis obliterans on chest CT on ___, although no 
clinical signs/symptoms and currently appropriately treated with 
steroids and cyclosporine. 
.
# MULTIPLE ___ DVTs: patient had left ___ swelling during 
hospitalization. ___ on ___ showed multiple BLE DVTs 
involving common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal and 
posterior tibial and peroneal veins on L>R. ___ swelling L>R. Pt 
started on heparin gtt overnight ___, with a goal PTT of 
60-80. She also has an IVC filter in place. Unfortunately, she 
then had BRBPR overnight with a supratherapeutic PTT (150).  The 
heparin gtt was held. She was started on enoxaparin 40mg BID for 
DVT prophylaxis, without further guaiac positive stools.  
.
# DYSPHAGIA, REDUCED VOCAL CORD MOBILITY: patient has h/o 
dysphagia secondary to muscle GVHD. She had repeat swallow study 
on ___ which showed no aspiration, also noted reduced right 
vocal cord mobility for which she should have outpatient ENT 
followup with Dr. ___ # ___. Swallow eval 
recs were soft solids, nectar thickened liquids, pills crushed 
in puree.

#. PAECILOMYCES ON BRONCHIOALVEOLAR LAVAGE: pt found to have 
paecilomyces growth on BAL on ___ (her last 
hospitalization) in Legionella bottle. She was discharged at 
that time on voriconazole with plan to follow up in 2 weeks. 
Voriconazole was continued throughout hospitalization. She will 
need outpatient ID follow-up in ___. 
___ with repeat chest CT prior to appointment, where it will be 
determined whether or not to continue Voriconazole. Beta glucan 
was rechecked and found to be 52 (down from 92 on ___.  
.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old woman with a history of CML s/p allo stem cell 
transplant in ___ complicated by GVHD and pulmonary 
Paecilomyces infection who presented with several days of new 
cough found to be RSV positive.  
.
# Dyspnea - Patient presented with SOB which worsened despite 
treatment with azithromycin. CT chest showed evidence of 
multifocal pneumonia. She was initially started on levofloxacin 
and vancomycin. The infectious disease team was consulted. 
Respiratory viral screen returned positive for RSV. Patient was 
treated with Palivizumab. Antibiotics were discontinued. 
Respiratory symptoms improved. Patient was discharged with plans 
to treat cough and nasal congestion symptomatically and follow 
up with her hematologist/oncologist and infectious disease 
specialist as scheduled. 
.
# GVHD: continued Azathioprine, cyclosporine, prednisone. Her 
prednisone dose was increased to 40 mg during the week of 
admission. It was tapered down to 30 mg ___ at time of 
discharge. 
.
# History of Paecilomyces Pulmonary Infection: Patient's 
voriconazole was changed to posaconazole given concern that it 
may be contributing to elevated LFTs. 
.
# History of DVT: Patient on Coumadin. INR fluctuated likely in 
the setting of many medication changes. Patient was discharged 
with alternating doses of 5 mg and 2.5 mg ___. She has plans 
to have her INR checked on ___ at her PCP's office.  
.
# Hypertension: continued home dose Metoprolol, Captopril, and 
amlodipine
.
# History of Clostridium difficile colitis: continued oral 
Vancomycin at prophylactic dosing
.
# Infection Prophylaxis - Continued Bactrim and acyclovir

Bone Marrow Bx 
HYPOCELLULAR BONE MARROW WITH TRILINEAGE HEMATOPOIESIS AND 
DECREASED MEGAKARYOCYTES.  NO MORPHOLOGIC EVIDENCE OF 
TRANSFORMATION OR HEMOPHAGOCYTIC SYNDROME ARE SEEN.  SEE NOTE.

Note: The findings overall suggest marrow suppression, perhaps 
related to TKIs, rather than hemophagocytic syndrome, i.e. there 
are only occasional hemophagocytic macrophages present, with 
hemosiderin-laden macrophages predominating, and no overt marrow 
""damage"" seen. 

Colon Bx:
Random colon, mucosal biopsies:
Colonic mucosa with focal crypt atrophy and dropout with rare 
basal crypt epithelial cell apoptoses consistent with graft 
versus host disease in the appropriate clinical setting; no 
viral cytopathic effect seen; see note.
Note: Given rare neutrophilic crypt abscesses, a concomitant 
acute infectious process cannot entirely be excluded. 
Immunostain for cytomegalovirus is in progress and will be 
reported in an addendum.
ADDENDUM #1: 
Immunostain for cytomegalovirus is negative with satisfactory 
controls.
ADDENDUM #2:
Immunostain for herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 is negative with 
satisfactory controls.

Renal Bx:
KIDNEY (LEFT), CORE BIOPSY:

1.THROMBOTIC MICROANGIOPATHY, SEE NOTE.2.SEVERE INTERSTITIAL 
FIBROSIS AND TUBULAR ATROPHY.
Note: The biopsy shows striking acute and chronic thrombotic 
microangiopathy involving arterioles and glomeruli.  The biopsy 
also shows advanced scarring of the tubulointerstitial 
compartment (70-80% of the cortical area).

Imaging:
CT abd/pelvis ___
 
IMPRESSION: 
  
1.No wall thickening or pneumatosis concerning for colitis.    
  
2.Small amount of non-hemorrhagic intraperitoneal fluid. 

MRI C spine ___
IMPRESSION:  No cord compression or abnormal enhancement within 
the spinal canal.  Mild-to-moderate degenerative changes. 

MRI Head ___
IMPRESSION:  No acute infarcts, mass effect, hydrocephalus or 
abnormal 
enhancement.  Mild changes of small vessel disease.  Mucosal 
thickening left maxillary sinus and soft tissue changes in 
bilateral mastoids.

Renal US:
IMPRESSION: 
  
1. No evidence of hydronephrosis, stones, or focal renal 
lesions. 
2. Ascites. 

CT Chest ___
IMPRESSION: 
  
1.  Scattered small ground-glass and ___ opacities in 
the upper lobes could represent atypical infection, as 
suspected, or inflammation. 
  
2.  4 mm right upper lobe nodule is new since ___ 
and likely also infectious or inflammatory; this may be 
reassessed for resolution on follow-up imaging. 
  
3.  Hyperdense liver and spleen, similar to prior, likely due to 

hemosiderosis.  
  

Right lower extremity venous ultrasound ___:
Partial thrombus in the proximal right superficial femoral vein 
is relatively unchanged compared to the prior examination 
without evidence of DVT progression.   

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is ___ with accelerated CML s/p allo transplant 
___ complicated by GVHD, pneumonia, myositis, and DVTs who 
initially presented with fatigue, diarrhea, pancytopenia in the 
setting of Cellcept and Ponatinib therapy.

# Diarrhea: Patient presented with 4 weeks of watery diarrhea 
with ___ bowel movements daily and poor appetite. Symptoms were 
most likely secondary to cellcept toxcity or ponatinib toxicity. 
Colon biopsy results were consisted with shallow crypts that are 
typically seen with GVHD or cellcept toxicity. While GVHD is a 
possible etiolgy, chronic GVHD is much less likely to present 
with acute diarrhea. An extensive infectious work up including 
norovirus, CMV, cdiff, adenovirus, parvovirus, HHV6, and O&P 
were negative. Ms. ___ improved with decreased cellcept 
dosing. She was transitioned from 1000mg BID to ___ BID at 
time of discharge. She continues to have ___ loose bowel 
movements daily. However, she continues to trend in a positive 
direction at the time of discharge. She did require 2 weeks of 
TPN but is now tolerating a PO diet at the time of discharge.

# Pancytopenia: Pt was noted to have progressive pancytopenia on 
outpatient labs over weeks preceeding admission. Pancytopenia is 
thought to be secondary to ponatinib toxicity as all cell lines 
improved after holding drug. Ms. ___ has experienced 
pancytopenia on previous TKI treatments as well. She was also 
transitioned from bactrim to atovaquone for PCP ___. A 
bone morrow biopsy was hypocellular but without concern for 
recurrent CML. A Graft chimerism study notable for 100% donor. 
Pt did also have HSV oral lesion and there may have been a 
component of HSV marrow suppression as her counts also improved 
with acyclovir therapy. Ponatinib is held at the time of 
discharge.

# Nephrotic syndrome:  The patient presented with acute on 
chronic CKD with creatinine around 2 this admission. Her 
creatinine has been gradually uptrending over the last year. It 
was never worked up and thought to be secondary to TKI therapy. 
She was found to have 4+ proteinuria this admission with low 
serum albumin and elevated triglycerides. A  renal biopsy was 
notable for acute on chronic microangiopathic disease, 
glomerular sclerosing and fibrosis of kidney. Etiology of 
changes remains unclear but differential is broad including 
effects of TKI treatment. There was no hydro or obtruction on 
renal us. Complement levels were normal and no serum 
cyroglobins. She was started on losartan 100mg daily and 
lisinopril 5mg for proteinuria. Pt was also started on aggresive 
IV diuresis for anasarca with improvement in fluid status. She 
will be discharged on 40mg PO Lasix with goal of maintaining 
within 2kg of her discharge weight, which was 143.6 lbs. 
Creatinine was stable around 2 at time of discharge. 

#Dyspnea: Patient promoted dyspnea during admission but never 
developed hypoxia. Symptoms were initially thought to be 
secondary to pulmonary edema and did improve with initial 
diuresis. However, symptoms did not completely resolve. A CT 
Chest was notable for some scattered ground glass opacities and 
a 4 mm right upper lobe nodule. PFTS show mixed obstructive and 
restrictive physiology. Fungal work up unrevealing. Pulmonology 
recommended a course of azithromycin for atypical pneumonia with 
follow up CT scan in 1 month. Dyspnea continued to improve at 
time of discharge following course of azithromycin. She was also 
started on pulmonary prophylaxis with FAM: daily fluticasone, 
azithromycin 3x/wk, monteleukast every other day.

#R lower extremity pain: Pt noted to have partial DVT of right 
superficial femoral vein which is unchanged from prev study in 
___ and most likely represents remnent from previous distal 
DVT which were treated with 6 months of anticoagulation. 
Vascular surg evaluated vascular appearing lesion on right lower 
extreity and are uncertain regarding etiology. ___ be secondary 
to smaller superficial thrombi in smaller leg veins. Recommend 
continued warm compresses, compression,and elevation of leg. 
Further anticoagulation at prophylactic dosing should be 
discussed as an outpatient once platlets are stable.

# Seizure like activity: Pt has 3 episodes of right neck 
twitching and mental status changes on ___ which appeared 
seizure like to staff. There was no tongue biting or generalized 
activity. An MRI Head was normal and LP without concern for 
bacterial infection. Viral cultures were all negative from CSF. 
An EEG was notable for encephalopathy without epileptical 
discharges. Pt experienced no further concerning neurologic 
changes following ___.

# HSV:Pt promoted oral pain on admission and was found to have 
several ulcerative lesions. An oral swab of lesions was positive 
for HSV. Symptoms and ulcers improved on acyclovir. She will 
continue prophylactic dosing as an outpatient.

#CML: Ms. ___ is status ___ allogenic transplant in ___ 
with recurrent disease in late ___. Disease has currently been 
well controlled on ponatinib with BCR-ABL PCR .09. However,has 
now been discontinued as drug toxicity outweighing benefits of 
treatment. As noted above, repeat bone marrow bx this admission 
without concern for recurrent disease. Chimerism study showed 
100% donor.

# GVHD: Has had GI  and skin involvement in past in addition to 
myositis. Has been well controlled on current MMF and prednisone 
dosing. While there was initial concern for GVHD as etiology to 
current presentation, it is uncommon to have diarrhea with 
chronic GVHD. Cellcept and prednisone doses were decreased this 
admission. She will need to closely monitor with recent decrease 
in immunosuppresion. 

#HTN: Ms. ___ had poorly controlled hypertension this 
admission. Most likely related to pregressive kidney disease. 
She was started on losartan, which was uptitrated to 100mg with 
good BP control by discharge.

#Hypogammablobulinemia: Likely ___ nephrotic syndrome and 
protein wasting. At admission, IgG level was 82 and she received 
an IVIg transfusion at 0.4g/kg. On ___, she received a second 
IVIg transfusion at the same dose for an IGg level of 300. 
During the second transfusion, she had some mild upper back pain 
and chills, which resolved with slowing the infusion.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of ___ at ___. 
___ came in for several weeks of watery diarrhea which we 
believe is due to cellcept toxicity. We decreased your dose of 
cellcept with improvement of your symptoms. ___ were also found 
to have a condition called pancytopenia, which means low number 
of blood cells. We believe your CML medication ponatinib caused 
this and your blood counts improved when we discontinued this 
medication. 

___ were also found to have worsening kidney function this 
admission. The cause of your kidney problem is unclear but may 
also be due to the drug ponatinib. ___ were placed on losartan, 
which will help the kidney function better. ___ will continue to

IMAGING:
EGD ___ Normal
Flex Sig ___ Normal

Renal US ___
Tiny echogenic focus noted in the left kidney, perhaps a small 
AML or a calcified lesion unlikely to be of clinical 
consequence, but otherwise normal renal ultrasound. 

CT Sinus ___
Mucosal thickening in the maxillary sinuses, worse on the left.  
Opacification of the right sphenoid sinus.  Small polyps in the 
right posterior middle nasal turbinate and right pharynx.  The 
ostiomeatal units are patent. 

Gastric Empyting Study ___
IMPRESSION: Rapid gastric emptying. Note that the patient did 
not consume the full standard meal, making these findings 
difficult to interpret. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o F with hx of accelerated phase CML s/p sibling allo D0 
___ presenting with diarrhea x 4 days and nausea/decreased 
PO intake w/ weight loss over the past 1 month.  

# CML
CML s/p sibling allo D0 ___ complicated by GVHD.  No longer 
on TKI given multiple side effects.  Previous chimerism and 
BCR-ABL gene rearrangement study shows no residual disease 
however repeat test showed increased level of BCR-ABL gene.  
Here mycophenylate was stoooped to increase graft versus. 
leukemia effect.  We continued her current prednisone regiemtn 
15mg alternating with 20mg.  Her acyclovir and atovaquone were 
continued. 

# Nausea/Weight Loss
History of 1 month of worsening nausea and decreased PO intake 
correlated with 5 pound weight loss.  Concern for upper GI GVHD 
given decrease in steroids and nausea.  EGD and flex sig 
negative for signs of GVHD.  Her gastric empyting study was 
inconclusive.  Her symptoms improved with zyprexa and zofran.  
She was able to tolerate a diet at time of discharge and her 
symptoms were well-controlled.
 
# Sinus Congestion
Concern for sinus infection given symptoms and immunocompromised 
state.  CT sinus shows mucosal thickening w/o bone involvement.  
She was started on levofloxacin for a total of 14 days of 
treatment.  Her symptoms were imporved with afrin, flonase, and 
saline irrigation.  She will follow-up in ___ clinic in 1 month.

# Diarrhea
Presents with diarrhea x4 days and overnight had more non-bloody 
watery diearrhea.  Most likely secondary to viral or bacterial 
gastroenteritis.  However could be due to GVHD and recent 
decrease in prednisone dosing. Also could be medication side 
effects from mycophenylate.  On previous admission, had diarrhea 
and her mycophenylate dose was decreasd with improvement in his 
symptoms.  Her TKI was also disconinued during this admission.  
Diarrhea has been improving and flex sig was without signs of 
GVHD.  Stool studies were negative for infection.  On discharge 
her diarrhea had resolved.
 
# Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis 
Elevated bicarb w/ hypercholemia most likely due to combination 
of chronic kidney diease, diarrhea, and NS fluids.  We started 
oral bicarb replacement and her serum bicarb level normalized at 
time of discharge.

# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure
Elevated Cr to 2.6 from baseline 1.9-2.3 likely pre-renal 
etiology secondary to diarrhea and poor PO intake.  Also could 
possibly be due to renal GVHD.  Improved with fluids to 1.8.

# HTN
Her lasix, losartan, metoprolol, and amlodipine were continued.

# CAD
We continued here ASA 81.

IMAGING
-------
TTE ___
IMPRESSION: Hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function. No 
clinically significant valvular regurgitation or stenosis. 
Indeterminate pulmonary artery systolic pressure. Suggestion of 
pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.  Compared with the 
prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the left ventricular 
systolic function is now hyperdynamic (LVEF previously 55-60%). 

Pharmacological Stress MIBI ___
INTERPRETATION: Left ventricular cavity size is normal.  Rest 
and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake 
throughout the left ventricular myocardium.  Gated images reveal 
normal wall motion. Septal wall motion compatible with prior 
CABG.  The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 65% 
post stress.
IMPRESSION: Normal myocardial perfusion study.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis ___
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of PTLD.  
2. Soft tissue nodules in the left lower quadrant most likely 
represent the sequela of subcutaneous injections.

CT Chest ___
IMPRESSION:
1. As compared to ___, no lung nodules have newly 
appeared.  The
pre-existing lung nodules, including the minimal ground-glass 
nodules in the upper lobe, are all constant, unsuspicious in 
morphology.  If the patient is not at high risk for cancer, the 
lesions do not require further followup, given that their 
dimension is below 4 mm.
2.  Status post CABG, no lymphadenopathy, no pleural effusions.

CXR ___
ET tube is in a standard position.  NG tube tip is out of view 
below the 
diaphragm.  Cardiomegaly is stable.  Increasing opacities in the 
right 
perihilar region and right lower lobe are worrisome for 
worsening pneumonia.  Component of pulmonary edema is stable.  
Left lower lobe pneumonia is stable.  There is no pneumothorax 
or large pleural effusion.  There are low lung volumes with 
stable widened mediastinum  due to engorgement of vessels. 

CXR ___:
The patient is currently not intubated.  The right internal 
jugular line tip is at the right atrium and should be pulled 
back approximately 3 cm.  Heart size and mediastinum are stable. 
 Lungs are essentially clear.  No pleural effusion or 
pneumothorax is appreciated, although cannot be entirely 
excluded. 

Muscle Biopsy ___:  Final Report Pending

CT Chest Without Contrast ___:  Newly appeared massive 
bilateral opacities, predominantly ground-glass in attenuation, 
with subtle areas of consolidation.  Accompanying airways 
disease and small pleural effusions with atelectasis. 

EMG ___:  Abnormal study. There is electrophysiologic 
evidence for a moderate, generalized myopathic process with 
denervating features. In addition, the data are suggestive of a 
moderate, generalized, axonal, sensorimotor polyneuropathy. 
Based on the limited repetitive stimulation studies performed, 
there is no evidence for a disorder of neuromuscular junction 
transmission, including myasthenia ___. Compared to the 
previous study dated ___, there has been an improvement 
in motor response amplitudes and worsening in sensory response 
amplitudes.  

 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  

Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o F with history of accelerated phase CML 
s/p sibling allo transplant on ___ complicated by upper and 
lower GI GVHD ___, liver GVHD in setting of reducing 
immunosuppression ___, GVHD related myopathy resulting in 
weakness and respiratory failure ___ who presented for 
presyncope. Her lightheadedness improved significantly with IV 
fluids and she had no further episodes of presyncope. She had 
elevated creatinine above baseline that resolved with IV fluids. 
She was found to have an elevated troponin that trended down 
thought to be likely due to demand ischemia in the setting of 
anemia in addition to poor clearance in the setting of acute on 
chronic kidney injury. Her BCR-ABL load was elevated compared to 
prior levels and her prednisone immunosuppression was decreased 
to improve control of her CML. She was also found to have an 
elevated EBV viral load with concern for PTLD/lymphoma and had a 
CT Torso which showed no evidence of PTLD. She received 1 dose 
of rituximab on ___ and tolerated well.

On reduction of the pt.'s prednisone, she developed severe 
myalgias and respiratory distress thought to be ___ muscle 
weakness, hypervolemia, and flash pulmonary edema with BPs in 
220s/110s. She was transferred to the ICU, required intubation, 
and was diuresed.  She was extubated and her respiratory status 
returned to baseline. She was found to have both a new 
consolidation on CXR evaluated by both the pulmonary service and 
infectious disease service who both recommended a course of 
antibiosis for HCAP. She also had an elevated troponin during 
this episode. Cardiology evaluated pt and determined her to have 
an NSTEMI in the setting of elevated troponin and new focal wall 
motion abnormality on echocardiogram. She continued to have 
myalgias and had a muscle biopsy and EMG to better assess the 
cause of her myalgias. ___ results indicate no signs of 
active GVHD or GVHD myasthenia ___. Final results are 
pending. She remained hemodynamically stable and was discharged 
to rehab on her admission dose of prednisone.
 
ACTIVE ISSUES

# Acute Myalgias and Muscle Weakness:  On admission, pt. reports 
diffuse muscle weakness and myalgias.  Following reduction of 
prednisone from alternating 15mg/20mg daily, pt. had significant 
worsening of symptoms.  CK was mildly elevated.  For concern of 
worsening symptoms ___ to ongoing levofloxacin (has been 
associated with increased risk of tenosynovitis in pt.'s on 
chronic steroids), this medication was discontinued.  An EMG was 
done showing no evidence of GVHD induced myasthenia ___.  
___ muscle biopsy performed on ___ of the left biceps 
femoris biopsy returned negative for any evidence of 
inflammation.  The most likely etiology of the patient's 
symptoms were thought to be ___ profound deconditioning with a 
possible component of steroid induced myopathic fibroatrophy 
given ongoing steroids over the last ___ years.  GVHD less likely 
given no evidence of myositis on ___ path, although pt.'s 
physical exam is somewhat consistent with chronic GVHD. 

# Respiratory Failure:  Following reduction of patient's 
steroids, pt. developed profound muscle weakness.  In this 
setting, she became hypoxic and later hypertensive with BPs in 
220s/110s.  She had a presumed episode of flash pulmonary edema 
which resulted in her transfer to the ICU and subsequent 
intubation.  Pt. was diuresed significantly and extubated 
without issue.  She was thought to be volume overloaded 
secondary to initial resuscitation following her pre-syncopal 
presentation.  Pt. continued to respond well to diuresis and was 
transferred back to the medical floor.

# Hospital Acquired Pneumonia:  Pt. had a new consolidation on 
CXR on this admission.  Started on HCAP coverage with 
vanc/meropenem.  The patient initially responded well and was 
d/c'ed off vanc.  Given concern for worsening pneumonia and 
respiratory distress, pulmonary was consulted for possible 
bronchoscopy.  ___ then recommended cardiology evaluation given 
ongoing elevated troponin and question of ischemic changes seen 
on TTE and EKG.  ID also saw pt. and recommended continuation of 
levofloxacin for total of 5 day course for atypical coverage and 
meropenem for total of 8 day course.  For concern that 
levofloxacin was contributing to pt.'s myalgias/ tendonitis, pt. 
was discontinued 1 day earlier than completion of full course.  
At time of discharge, pt. had ongoing improving cough.  She had 
a repeat CXR (___) negative for consolidation or pulmonary 
edema.  

# NSTEMI:  In the setting of episode of flash pulmonary edema, 
pt. had an elevated troponin.  Cardiology evaluated the patient 
who recommended a repeat TTE which revealed showed decrease in 
EF to 40% and akinesis of the anteroseptal wall.  Given her 
known CAD, this was thought to most likely be related to either 
a type 1 primary coronary event or type 2 demand ischemia in the 
setting of recent hypertensive emergency and flash pulmonary 
edema.  Given that pt. was a poor cath candidate with ongoing 
acute on chronic kidney injury, will proceed with medical 
optimization at this time.  As such, pt. was discharged on ASA 
81mg Daily, metoprolol and amlodipine for afterload reduction.  
A statin was held at this time given ongoing myalgias.  Her 
losartan was held for resolving acute on chronic kidney injury.  


# Admission Troponin elevation:  Pt. had admission Troponin peak 
at 1.07, CK-MB 11. Patient did not have chest pain at this time, 
but did report dizziness and dyspnea which may be her anginal 
equivalent. ECG on admission was not suggestive of ischemia.  
Pt. evaluated for ACS but noted to have downtrending trops in 
setting of resolving anemia and resolving acute on chronic 
kidney injury.  Initial TTE showed hyperdynamic function 
consistent with her volume depleted status.  In the setting of 
known CAD, pt. also had a persantine stress MIBI which was 
negative for evidence of malperfusion/ischemia.  Likely cause of 
admission troponin elevation was thought to be due to demand 
ischemia in the setting of anemia in addition to poor clearance 
in the setting of acute on chronic kidney injury.  

# Poor appetite:  Patient not taking good PO at home. Signs of 
anasarca on exam with diffuse dependent edema.  Pt. states that 
she is eating more on this hospitalization compared to any other 
time recently.  Denies nausea/vomiting, abdominal symptoms, 
diarrhea.  Pt. was started on marinol for appetite stimulation 
but developed excess sedation.  This medication was 
discontinued. 

# Anemia:  On admission, pt. found to have Hct drop from 27 to 
19.  She received fluids in clinic of unknown quantity.  No 
history of bleeding.  Anemia work-up was negative for hemolysis 
with normal TSH level.  Pt. did have a retic count which was low 
given the level of anemia consistent with decreased production 
likely ___ pt's CML.  Her Hct remained stable after initial 
transfusion throughout the remainder of admission.

# Presyncope/lightheadedness:  Pt. presented with orthostatic 
hypotension in the setting of poor PO intake and ongoing 
antihypertensive/diuretic therapy making hypovolemia the most 
likely etiology. Given troponin elevation, considered cardiac 
etiology however stress MIBI negative.  Her lightheadedness 
resolved after giving IV fluids.  Her home furosemide and 
amlodipine were discontinued.  The patient was discharged on a 
reduced hypertensive regimen as described in transitional 
issues. 

# Acute on chronic kidney injury:  On admission, pt. was found 
to have creatinine elevated to 2.6 from baseline of 1.5 to 2.0.  
Likely pre-renal given hypovolemia with orthostasis.  She 
received IV fluids and her creatinine returned to baseline.  Pt. 
then had second episode of acute on chronic kidney injury ___ 
poor forward flow in the setting of flash pulmonary edema and 
NSTEMI.  Her renal function returned to baseline with diuresis.  
She was noted to have an elevated uric acid at this time which 
dramatically decreased following one dose of rasburicase. 

# CML
Accelerated phase CML s/p sibling allo D0 ___ now relapsed 
CML.  BCR-ABL returned slightly elevated compared to prior.  We 
continued prophylaxis on home acyclovir, atovaquone, fluconazole 
at renal dosing.  Her prednisone was attempted to be reduced to 
15mg daily to improve control of CML with evidence of increasing 
BCR-ABL.  The pt. did not tolerate this as above.  She has a 
repeat BCR ABL and kinase domain mutation pending.  TKI should 
be considered as an outpatient.

# Elevated EBV Viral Load
EBV was elevated on last admission and more elevated on this 
admission.  HHV6/Parvo B19 negative.  For concern of 
PTLD/lymphoma, pt. was evaluated with CT Torso which showed no 
evidence of PTLD.  Pt. given 1 dose of rituximab on ___ and 
tolerated it well.  

# Sinusitis 
Pt. received course of levofloxacin with resolution of symptoms.

CHRONIC ISSUES
# Hypertension:  Stable.  Continued altered regimen as described 
above.

# Hyperlipidemia
Stable.  Not currently on therapy at this time

# Coronary artery disease 
Stable.  Will continue home aspirin and antihypertensives as 
above.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:

1. Heme/Onc Follow-Up: Pt. requires follow-up with Dr. ___ on 
___ and ___. 

2. NSTEMI Follow-Up: Pt. requires follow-up with cardiology in 
___ weeks from discharge. She also should have a repeat TTE 
shortly prior to this visit. She has an appt. with cardiology on 
___.

3. Lab Work: Pt. does have chronic anemia and thrombocytopenia 
secondary to her CML. Pt. should receive labs every other day 
(CBC with diff, Chem 10, ALT, AST, Alk Phos, TBili, LDH, ___, 
PTT, INR) while at rehab. Lab results should be faxed to Dr. 
___ office at ___.

4. Hypertension Regimen: Pt. presented with orthostasis thought 
to be ___ both poor PO intake and strict blood pressure control. 
She also had an NSTEMI while hospitalized. Pt. was discontinued 
off of her daily losartan for ongoing renal dysfunction. 
Metoprolol XL was reduced to 250mg Daily from 300mg Daily. She 
was continued on amlodipine 5mg PO Daily. Furosemide was 
continued at 20mg PO Daily. Pt's standing weight at discharge 
was 139 lbs. Pt's medications should be titrated appropriately 
to HR and BP. Her losartan should also be restarted if possible 
if close monitoring is available, in place of amlodipine if 
amlodipine if not needed for blood pressure control.

5. Immunosuppression and steroid taper: Pt. was unable to 
tolerate prednisone taper as she had significant exacerbation of 
myopathy and muscle weakness. As such, she was continued on her 
admission dose of alternating daily doses of prednisone 
15mg/20mg. If attempting to reduce prednisone in future, please 
reduce on slow taper, consider ___ / week as tolerated and 
closely monitor symptoms. 

6. Poor Nutrition: Pt. has mild anasarca likely in part due to 
poor nutrition partially caused by decreased appetite and 
nausea. Pt. was started on dronabinol to improve these symptoms, 
however she became sedated. This medication was not continued at 
discharge. She was continued on furosemide prn for management of 
fluid volume.

7. Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor: Given increase CML disease 
activity, possible use of TKI should be discussed with Dr. 
___. Ponatinib has been associated with increased incidence 
of cardiac events and should be avoided in this pt. with known 
CAD and now recent NSTEMI. Desatinib may be a better option but 
was not initiated at time of discharge. Consider slow 
uptitration of dosage starting at 20mg as pt. tolerates.

8. Levofloxacin: Pt. was discontinued off of levofloxacin as 
this medication was associated with worsening myalgias in this 
pt. Please avoid fluoroquinolone class if possible as this seems 
to worsen her myalgias. There also is a high risk of 
tenosynovitis with these abx. in pt.'s on chronic steroids. 

9. Statin: Given pt's known CAD and NSTEMI on this admission, 
pt. would benefit from a statin. Pt. was not initiated on this 
hospitalization given myalgias.

10. Steroids and Osteopenia: Pt. had a bone scan in ___ 
revealing osteopenia. Given her chronic steroid use, please 
consider every ___ month bone scans.

11. Access Issues: Vascular access and lab draws have been a 
challenge as an inpatient. Additionally, pt. has coagulopathy 
likely ___ chronic steroid use resulting in diffuse ecchymosis 
from minimal skin injury. Given upcoming treatments and likely 
multiple hospitalizations, pt. may benefit from Port vs. PICC 
placement.

12. Pulm Follow-Up: Pt. was evaluated by the pulmonary consult 
team who recommended repeat chest CT 4 weeks from ___ to 
evaluate for resolution of pneumonia. If pt. has new symptoms, 
chest CT should be considered prior to this time. If resolution, 
no pulmonary follow-up is necessary. This can be coordinated 
with Dr. ___. 

13. Pending Labs: Pt. has BCR ABL and Domain Kinase mutation lab 
pending. This should be follow-up by Dr. ___.

14. Uric Acid: Pt. had elevated uric acid level on admission. We 
did not start allopurinol at this time given resolving kidney 
dysfunction. Consider starting allopurinol as an outpatient.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___.  You were admitted to the hospital 
because you felt as though you were going to faint and were not 
eating or drinking well.  You received fluids through your IV 
and your lightheadedness improved.  You also had worsening 
kidney function likely due initially to poor oral intake and 
later to heart dysfunction.  Your heart enzymes were found to be 
elevated both on admission and during your hospitalization.  The 
ultrasound of your heart initially was normal as well as a 
stress test.  A repeat ultrasound did show some wall damage 
indicating that you most likely had a small heart attack.  
Additionally, your EBV virus level was high.  You received one 
dose of rituximab to treat the EBV virus.

You prednisone dose was decreased to help improve control of 
your CML.  However, you developed worsening muscle pain and 
required help breathing with an airway tube in the Intensive 
Care Unit.  We removed excess fluid which improved your 
breathing.  You were also found to have a pneumonia at this time 
which was treated with antibiotics.  We obtained a muscle biopsy 
and an EMG to better assess your muscle pain.  These tests are 
currently pending.  Your condition improved and you were 
discharged with close follow-up.

All the best,

Your ___ Team

GVHD, liver GVHD, GVHD related myopathy, who presented from ___ 
clinic for lab abnormalities including hyperkalemia (5.4), 
elevated uric acid (11.5) and acute renal failure (2.3) and was 
found to have a DVT in left ___.  

#DVT in Lt ___: Based on ___ done on ___, DVT seems to be 
chronic and decreasing in size. Based on repeat ___ on ___, 
there is evidence of a new DVT in Lt superficial femoral vein 
that was not visualized on previous study. On presentation, pt 
had scute worsening of ___ edema, prompting us to do further 
imaging. Pt was initially started on heparin gtt with goal PTT 
50-80. However, given high risk of bleeding and current severe 
bruising, we transitioned to heparin SC 12500U BID. We will 
discharge pt on heparin SC 12500U BID for ___ months in 
discretion of outpatient oncologist, Dr. ___. 
- continue heparin SC 12500U BID for ___ months
- hold aspirin 81mg 

#chronic kidney failure: Cr 2.2 on discharge; baseline 1.5-2.0. 
Creatinine ranged 1.8-2.3 during hospitalization. Most likely 
prerenal in the setting of poor po intake; however, elevated 
uric acid may be contributing as well. 
. Throughout hospitalization, she received 1L of fluid and only 
upon admission. We encouraged oral intake and pt was compliant 
with plan. Given history of chronic kidney diseae and 
microangiopathic injury, small daily changes in the Cr are not 
clinically significant. ___ on presentation most likely prerenal 
given improvement with hydration. Based on renal biopsy done in 
___, there is thrombotic microangiopathic injury and severe 
intersitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. These changes may be 
due to TKI. We held lasix and discontinued it on discharge. 
Resuming lasix will be in discretion of PCP ___ Dr. ___. 
Please encourage oral intake. Please renally dose all 
medications and monitor pt's I/O's and weight. If Cr. rises, pt 
can be given IVF conservatively since new TTE showed EF 55%.  

#CML: Progression of pt's CML was not addressed during this 
hospitalization. This will be assessed as outpatient with Dr. 
___. Last BCR/AML checked on ___ and increasing. Pt p/w 
hyperuricemia and thrombocytopenia, which may be indicating 
changes in leukemia and rapid cell turn over. We tapered 
prednisone by 1mg every other day and stopped at 10mg daily. 
This is the dose we recommend on discharge. Changes can be made 
in discretion of Dr. ___. 

#Hyperuricemia: Urice acid on presentation 11.4. Pt was treated 
with one dose of rasburicase 6mg IV and was further placed on 
allopurinol ___ daily. However, repeat urice acid on ___ was 
8.7. Given that pt has CKD and is already on optimal dose of 
allopurinol ___ daily. We added Febuxostat 40 mg PO daily on 
___ and recommend continuing allopurinol for one week after 
discharge, last dose on ___. 
The exact cause of elevated uric acid is unknown. It may be due 
to rapid cell turnover and changes in CML. Pt will be follow up 
with Dr. ___ further assessment. We recommend checking 
uric acid level in one week. Elevated uric acid may be 
contributing to poor kidney function. 

#Thrombocytopenia: Plt count fluctuated through hospital course. 
This (in addition to hyperuricemia) may present rapid cell 
turnover and changes in leukemia. We discontinued aspirin on 
discharge and held it throughout hospitalization. We recommend 
monitoring plt count as outpatient. 

#Myopathy: Muscle biopsy official report showed no evidence of 
myositit but abnormal muscle fibers. Exact etiology is unclear 
but GVHD and possibly steroids likely. We tapered steroids and 
discharged pt on prednisone 10mg daily.  

#Cough: Most likely viral and post-infectious. Improving but 
intermittent in nature. It has been going on for a few weeks and 
since last admission. CT chest/sinuses negative for any acute 
infectious processes. CT-chest (done twice on ___ and ___ 
showed improvement of opacities observed in ___. Pulmonary 
was consulted and concluded no indication for bronchoscopy given 
improvement in imaging. They concluded post-infectious cough as 
most likely etiology and recommended atroven neb. Given the 
setting of new DVT, there was concern for PE. Pt was tachycardic 
but no dyspnea or pleuritic chest pain. V/Q was negative for PE 
on ___. B-glucan was positive on ___ but repeat on ___ was 
negative. Galactomannan was negative. 

#CAD s/p CABG: History of NSTEMI on last admission is 
questionable since pt only had a trop leak but no EKG changes or

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you here at the ___ 
___. 

You presented to us with laboratory abnormalities most likely 
due to acute kidney injury and dehydration. We treated you with 
IV fluids and following adequate hydration, these laboratory 
abnormalities resolved and your kidney function improved. In 
addition, your uric acid was very high on admission and you were 
given medications to lower the level since it can cause damage 
to your kidneys. You are being discharged on new medications, 
called allopurinol and febuxostat to maintain low uric acid 
levels. Allopurinol will be discontinued in one week, ___. It 
is important to mention that given your history of chronic 
kidney disease, small daily changes in your kidney function are 
not of clinical significance and can be managed by IV fluids. We 
encourage you to drink plenty of water everyday. 

You were also found to have a blood clot in your left leg. You 
are being treated with heparin injections twice a day. We also 
lowered your steroid dosage gradually and stopped at prednisone 
10mg daily. 

Please take your medications as instructed. Please attend all 
your follow up appointments. Please follow up with Dr. ___ in 
clinic on ___ as scheduled.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male without medical care 
for several years, no known past medical history, who initially 
presented to ___ on ___ with SOB and palpitations. 

In the ED at ___ he was found to be in afib with RVR to 
150s and respiratory distress. He was initially on BiPAP and 
weaned to ___.  CXR showed bialteral infiltrates concerning for 
pulmonary edema. Troponin was mildly elevated to 0.16, BNP was 
1066. An EKG showed lateral STD and cardiology was consulted. He 
was initially given ASA but heparin gtt was not started due to 
concern for AAA (See below). He was initially treated with 
diltiazem gtt and admitted to the ICU. An echo was obtained due 
to pulmonary edema and orthopnea and revealed a LVEF 35%, 
mild-mod global hypokinesis of inferior wall and septum, mod AI, 
mod AS, mod MR, mod TR, and mod pulmonary HTN. There was also 
moderate dilation of the aortic root and ascending aorta. No 
significant pericardial effusion was seen.  

The patient's labs were also notable for a marked leukocytosis 
with L-shift including 2% blasts. Due to concern for infection a 
CTA chest with CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast was obtained 
to rule out infectious source and PE. There was no PE or 
evidence of infection but a 6cm infrarenal AAA with possible 
evidence of impending rupture was seen. Dr. ___ at ___ 
reviewed the images urgently and felt no evidence of imminent 
rupture but transfer was initiated. 

While in the ICU he was switched from diltiazem to esmolol gtt 
and diuresed with IV Lasix with improvement in his orthopnea. 
The CTA had also been notable for bilateral pleural effusions 
and infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema. 

On arrival to ___ the patient reports feeling improved without 
any pain or discomfort. He relays the following history: He last 
had a physical ___ years ago as part of being a ___ 
___. He has no known medical history. At baseline he has no 
functional limitation with walking on flat ground and can walk 
up at lest 2 flights of stairs without needing to stop for air. 
He has no orthopnea, PND, leg swelling, palpitations, or chest 
pain at baseline. He had no fevers, chills, URI symptoms, n/v/d 
prior to this presentation. 

He has smoked 1ppd for at least ___ years, 2 ppd for the last 
year, and quit 3 weeks ago. He previously drank 5 mixed drinks 
per week but cut back to 3 mixed drinks per week 6 months ago 
with no history of alcohol withdrawal. No recreational drugs, no 
new sexual contacts and no history of STDs.

caliber vessel. This vessel bifurcates into the
Left Anterior Descending and Left Circumflex systems.
LAD: The Left Anterior Descending artery, which arises from the 
LM, is a large caliber vessel. There is
a 50% stenosis in the proximal segment.
The Septal Perforator, arising from the proximal segment, is a 
small caliber vessel.
The Diagonal, arising from the proximal segment, is a medium 
caliber vessel.
Cx: The Circumflex artery, which arises from the LM, is a large 
caliber vessel. There is a 90% stenosis
in the mid segment of the AV groove branch of the LCx
The Obtuse Marginal, arising from the proximal segment, is a 
medium caliber vessel.
RCA: The Right Coronary Artery, arising from the right cusp, is 
a large caliber vessel. There is a 50%
stenosis in the proximal segment.
The Right Posterior Descending Artery, arising from the distal 
segment, is a medium caliber vessel.
The Right Posterolateral Artery, arising from the distal 
segment, is a medium caliber vessel.
Findings
 Three vessel coronary artery disease. Moderate LAD and RCA 
disease with most significant
diseases noted in the medium caliber AV groove segment of the 
LCx

___
CONCLUSION:
The left atrial volume index is SEVERELY increased. The right 
atrium is mildly enlarged. The estimated right atrial pressure 
is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with a borderline increased/dilated cavity. There is 
normal regional left ventricular systolic function. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed. There is 
beat-to-beat variability in the left
ventricular contractility due to the irregular rhythm. The 
visually estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is 45-50%. 
Left ventricular cardiac index is normal (>2.5 L/min/m2). (-10.4 
%; normal less
than -20%) There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract 
gradient. Mildly dilated right ventricular
cavity with normal free wall motion. The aortic sinus diameter 
is normal for gender with normal
ascending aorta diameter for gender. The aortic arch diameter is 
normal with a mildly dilated descending
aorta. The abdominal aorta is severely dilated. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are moderately thickened.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.5 
cm2). However, dimensionless index is 0.26
when using the same beat that exhibits highest peak velocity 
through the aortic valve. There is mild to
moderate [___] aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets 
are mildly thickened with no mitral valve
prolapse. Torn mitral valve chordae are seen. There is mild [1+] 
mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild [1+] tricuspid 
regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: 1) Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction suggesting 
CAD in LCX territory. Global
longitudinal strain is moderately depressed. 2) Moderate aortic 
stenosis by aortic valve area
however the dimensionless index borders to severe aortic 
stenosis repeat evaluation of aortic
stenosis severity in sinus rhythm may bring clarity about true 
severity of aortic stenosis. 3) The
patient has significant mitral annular calcification and 
thickening of the mitral valve leaflets with
reverbaration artifact in the left atrium however a small 
echogenicity on the posterior mitral
annulus cannot be excluded. If clinically indicated a TEE may 
improve visualization.

+TEE ___
CONCLUSION:
There is moderate/severe spontaneous echo contrast in the body 
of the left atrium and in the left atrial appendage. A probable 
xx cm left atrial appendage thrombus is seen. The left atial 
appendage ejection
velocity is very depressed. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen 
in the body of the right atrium or right atrial appendage. There 
is no evidence for an atrial septal defect by 2D/color Doppler. 
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch with complex (>4mm, 
non-mobile) atheroma in the descending aorta to 35cm from the 
incisors. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are moderately 
thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. No abscess is seen. There is trace aortic 
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately 
thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral 
valve. No abscess is seen. There is mild to
moderate [___] mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve 
leaflets appear structurally normal. No mass/ vegetation are 
seen on the tricuspid valve. No abscess is seen. There is mild 
[1+] tricuspid regurgitation.
IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast with 
probable formation of sludge/thrombus in the left atrial 
appendage. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. Complex 
atheroma in the descending aorta.

Brief Hospital Course:
========
SUMMARY
========
Mr. ___ is a ___ male without medical care 
for several years, no known past medical history, who initially 
presented to ___ on ___ with SOB and palpitations, 
found to have heart failure (acute, unclear if chronic 
component), afib with RVR, leukocytosis with left shift, and 
infrarenal 6cm AAA. 

====================
ACUTE MEDICAL ISSUES
====================
#6cm infrarenal AAA: CT read at outside hospital raised 
concerning for evidence of hemorrhage into wall and weakening of 
wall concerning for impending rupture. However, per review by 
Dr. ___ ___ vascular surgery team there was no 
radiographic evidence of rupture and emergent surgery was not 
indicated. Vascular surgery team saw him in house and 
recommended optimization of cardiac problems before proceeding 
with an elective AAA repair. To further evaluate the AAA, we 
obtained a dedicated CTA abdomen. Vascular surgery reviewed 
imaging and appears amenable to physician modified ___. He 
was asymptomatic from the AAA standpoint. 

From a cardiology standpoint, we would like to treat with 
uninterrupted anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks at which time 
we will repeat TEE to assess atrial thrombus. If thrombus has 
resolved, consider for cardioversion pending repeat assessment 
of EF at that time. If has cardioversion, would need to be 
followed by another 4 weeks of uninterrupted anticoagulation. 

# HFrEF, acute: Initial Outside hospital TTE showed LVEF 35% 
with inferior WMA, moderate MR/TR, moderate AI and AS while 
patient was in atrial fibrillation. On repeat at ___ while in 
afib with improved rate control showed LVEF 45-50%. He reported 
no functional limitations at home prior to this incident without 
PND, or orthopnea. He underwent a cardiac cath on ___ which 
showed coronary disease (99% stenosis of distal LCx) though not 
significant enough to explain his degree of cardiomyopathy. 
Suspect cardiomyopathy is tachycardia-mediated and may improve 
with cardioversion. Should plan for cardioversion if repeat TEE 
in 4 weeks shows resolution of atrial thrombus and persistent 
reduced EF while in atrial fibrillation. Will discharge on every 
other day dosing of lasix 20 mg. 

# NSTEMI: Presented with lateral STDs on EKG on admission, mild 
troponinemia which has not been rising. Suspect this represents 
a type II NSTEMI secondary to demand ischemia, however could 
have had a missed event several days prior to admission. Cardiac 
cath did show significant a 99% stenosis of distal LCx which was 
not revascularized as did not seem to be supplying significant 
portion of myocardium and given need for surgery in near future 
did not want to commit patient to ___ year of uninterrupted DAPT. 
Optimized medication regimen with ASA, statin, and beta blocker.

# A. fib w/ RVR: Unclear trigger, but suspect may have been 
missed ischemic event as above. Patient was initially held off 
of anticoagulation due to possible need for surgery but once 
deemed stable was started on apixaban 5mg BID (CHADs2-VASc score 
is 4). Patient was initially started on an esmolol gtt but 
eventually transitioned to PO metoprolol succinate 200mg QAM and 
100mg QPM and PO digoxin 0.125mg daily with good control of 
rates. Patient had a TEE in anticipation of cardioversion but 
discovered a left atrial thrombus so cardioversion was aborted. 
Patient will need to remain on uninterrupted for 4 weeks and 
have a repeat TEE at that time to assess for resolution of 
atrial thrombus.  Should also assess ejection fraction at that 
time and if still compromised, consider cardioversion for 
possible tachycardia mediated cardiomyopathy.

# Leukocytosis: Patient presented with leukocytosis in the range 
of ___ with no clear evidence of infection clinically or on 
imaging. In ___ he had had a WBC of 18 on outside labs which he 
brought in for our review. Heme/onc reviewed smear which 
contained signficant left shift and circulating blast count of 
2%. No dysplastic features seen. He was initially given ATRA on 
___ due to concern for APML. However,given the absence of a 
significant number of circulating blasts in the periphery this 
was felt to be unlikely. ___ was sent for BCR/ABL PCR and was 
negative.  This effectively excludes a diagnosis of chronic 
myelogenous leukemia.  Per heme/onc, given low blast count and 
leukocytosis on previous testing, very unlikely to be an acute 
leukemia.  On ___, patient underwent bone marrow biopsy.  
Results pending.  Patient has a follow-up appointment with the 
oncology team on ___ to review results of bone marrow biopsy.
  
# ___: Unknown baseline, Cr 1.8 on admission downtrended to 1.1 
on discharge.  Likely cardiorenal in the setting of heart 
failure exacerbation on admission.  Patient was given IV 
diuresis with improvement in creatinine.  Patient likely has 
mild CKD although do not have baseline to compare to.

# s/p Tobacco use disorder: had quit prior to admission. 

====================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
====================
[] Atrial fibrillation and left atrial thrombus: Rate is well 
controlled at discharge on metoprolol and digoxin.  Patient 
should remain on Eliquis 5 mg twice daily uninterrupted and 
should have repeat TEE in 4 weeks to reassess left atrial 
thrombus.  If ejection fraction still compromised at that time 
please consider cardioversion for potential tachycardia induced 
cardiomyopathy.
[] Should have repeat digoxin level drawn on ___ to make sure 
at therapeutic level given possible interaction with statin.
[] Please check BMP 1 week after discharge and if creatinine 
stable consider starting an ACE inhibitor to optimize heart 
failure treatment.
[] On CT torso patient was noted to have several sub-solid 
pulmonary nodules measuring less than 6 mm for which follow-up 
with CT chest in ___ months as recommended by radiology.
[] Bone marrow biopsy results are pending at time of discharge.  
Patient will follow-up appointment with hematology to review 
results as outpatient.  Please ensure patient is aware of 
appointment and any hematology recommendations.
[] Patient will be discharged on Lasix 20 mg every other day.  
Patient advised to check his weight daily and notify his 
physician if weight increases by more than 3 pounds in 1 day.  
If weight continues to increase will likely need to uptitrate 
diuretic and increased frequency.

Discharge Instructions:
 Dear Mr. ___,
  
It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___!  

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?  
==========================   
- You were admitted because your heart rate was very fast and 
you were short of breath.

WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL?  
==============================  
- You were transferred to ___ due to concern about an enlarged 
blood vessel in your abdomen (AAA).
- Vascular surgery reviewed your imaging and will plan on 
surgery when your heart rate is stabilized and they can 
interrupt your anticoagulation.
- You were diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. Your heart rate 
was controlled with medications (metoprolol and digoxin). 
- You were also started on a blood thinner (apixaban AKA 
ELiquis) for stroke prevention. 
- You were found to have a blood clot in your heart, which means 
your anticoagulation needs to be uninterrupted for 4 weeks.   
- You underwent a bone marrow biopsy on ___ and you tolerated 
the procedure well. 

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME?  
================================  
- Please take all your medications as prescribed.
- Please arrange to establish with a primary care doctor within 
1 week of discharge.
- Please go to your follow up appointments as scheduled below 
with cardiology, hematology, and vascular surgery.
- Please refrain from showering for 24 hours after your bone 
marrow biopsy.
- You will need to remain on anticoagulation (eliquis) 
uninterrupted for at least the next 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, you 
should undergo another transesophageal echocardiogram to 
reassess the clot. If it has resolved, then you should discuss 
with your Cardiologist about cardioversion.
- Your surgeon will be in coordination with your Cardiologist to 
decide the safest timing of surgery.
- Weigh yourself when you get home and every morning. If your 
weight changes more than 2 lbs. within 24 hours, call your 
physician for management of your heart failure medications.

Thank you for allowing us to be involved in your care, we wish 
you all the best!

IMAGING:
___ CT CHEST W/O CON
IMPRESSION: 
1.  New small foci of ground-glass opacities in the upper lobes, 
larger on the 
left, are worrisome for infection. 
2.  Stable splenomegaly. 
3.  Dense coronary calcifications. 
4.  New small left effusion. 
5.  Stable enlargement of the main pulmonary arteries suggesting 
pulmonary 
hypertension. 

___ LLE DUPLEX U/S
IMPRESSION: 
  
Chronic, non-occlusive thrombus of the left proximal superficial 
femoral vein, 
unchanged since ___.   

___ CXR (PORT)
REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with CML 
transformation into AML and blast crisis with persistent cough. 
Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison 
to ___. 
The right central venous line tip is at the cavoatrial 
junction/proximal right atrium.  Heart size and mediastinum are 
stable.  There is new left 
retrocardiac opacity, not seen on the prior study, concerning 
for left lower lobe pneumonia associated with small amount of 
pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen. 

___ TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild 
to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with 
near-akinesis of the septum, and hypokinesis of the basal-mid 
anterior wall. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left 
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is 
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The 
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is 
no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most 
likely represents a prominent fat pad. 

IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction 
consistent with LAD ischemia/infarction. Mild mitral 
regurgitation. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___ and 
___, the function of the septum and anterior wall are 
similar (septal function was described as mildly hypokinetic on 
the most recent study but it was severely hypokinetic then 
also). The function of the mid to distal inferior wall has 
improved. Mild mitral regurgitation is seen.  

PATHOLOGY:
___ IMMUNOPHENOTYPING
Increased number of blasts. In a context of patient's known CML, 
this is concerning for acute blast crisis.  Correlation with 
clinical findings and morphology (see separate report 
___ is recommended.  Flow cytometry immunophenotyping 
may not detect all abnormal populations due to topography, 
sampling or artifacts of sample preparation

___ Bone marrow bx
 Chronic Myelogeneous leukemia - Blast phase (CML-BP), see note.
Note: This represents acute myelegenous transformation of the 
patient's
previously diagnosed CML; ie., CML-BP. CD34 and CD117 are 
increased and
highlight blasts occupying estimated 70-80% of the overall 
cellularity.
 CD20 highlights rare B cells.  CD3 stains interstitial T 
lymphocytes.
CD42 is present in the megakaryocytes, which do not appear 
increased.
TdT is negative.  MP0 is not expressed in blasts.  Glycophorin
highlights erythroid precursors, but is negative in the blasts.

___ Skin bx
PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:

Skin, left mid back; punch biopsy:

 - Mild spongiosis with dyskeratosis, patchy interface 
inflammation and
focal intra-epidermal eosinophils,  with superficial 
perivascular
mononuclear cell infiltrate and dermal eosinophils (see 
comment).
 - No fungal organisms identified on a PAS stain.
 - Multiple tissue levels examined.

Comment:  The histologic differential diagnosis includes both a
hypersensitivity reaction and graft versus host disease. The 
presence
of eosinophils is compatible with the clinical suspicion of a 
drug
eruption, although they do not exclude graft versus host 
disease.
Clinical correlation is recommended.

 

 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with CML s/p sibling allo D0 ___, complicated by chronic 
GVHD with gut, liver, muscle involvement presenting from ___ 
clinic with hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, hypercalcemia, ___ on 
CKD and pancytopenia, now with conversion to AML.
 
#CML/AML: BCR/ABL trended up from 0 to 2 to 5 to 104 to 162. 
Presented with hyperuricemia and pancytopenia likely due to 
conversion to AML and rapid cell turn over. No evidence of 
bleeding. Hemolysis unlikely with normal coag studies and Tbili. 
 Retic count 1.8 with retic index 0.88% showed poor red cell 
production. CMV/EBV/HHV6 negative. BM bx shows conversion to AML 
with as much as 65% blasts on smear with absolute blast count as 
high as 1200 and 0% neutrophils. Treated with 12 days of 
nilotinib with no improvement. Given continued decline and poor 
prognosis, transitioned to comfort measures only after which she 
expired. 

#Cough/HCAP: Patient had intermittently productive cough for ___ 
weeks with negative workup on last admission including CXR, CT 
Chest, V/Q scan, rapid resp viral panel. Clear lung exam, 
negative CXR at rehab prior to admission. RRV panel and cx, 
beta-glucan, galactomannan negative. BNP >40K so volume overload 
potentially played a partial role especially given LVEF 40-45% 
on TTE. PE unlikely as patient not hypoxic, no evidence of right 
heart strain on EKG, no evidence of infarct on CT Chest; 
regardless, anticoagulation held in setting of thrombocytopenia 
and no hemodynamic compromise. CT showed ?infectious process, in 
the setting of worsening cough/resp status portable CXR showed 
likely LLL PNA. On ___ patient met ___ SIRS criteria 
(tachycardic, tachypneic, low WBC) so cx drawn and started on 
empiric vanc/meropenem. Received benzonatate, codeine, 
guaifenesin-dextromethorphan as well as levalbuterol/ipratropium 
nebs prn for symptomatic relief. With continued worsening 
respiratory status patient started on morphine for SOB O2 
supplementation prn. Given prognosis, she was transitioned to 
comfort measures only with withdrawal of abx, scopalamine patch, 
and morphine gtt, on which she expired. 

#Hypercalcemia: Baseline high 8s-9s, on admission 10.7. Unclear 
etiology, given elevated alk phos in the setting of CKD could 
have increased bony release of calcium though increased bone 
turnover would likely cause a higher phosphate level. PTH 6 
which rules out hyperparathyroidism and makes hypercalcemia in 
the setting of worsening CML more likely especially with Vit D 
wnl but PTHrP elevated. Received IVF, furosemide, ___ dose 
pamidronate ___ and calcitonin ___ while calcium 
carbonate/Vit D held and calcium downtrended to 8.4.

#UTI: Found to have citrobacter/klebsiella UTI on culture taken 
after patient began to appear septic with ___ SIRS signs. 
Infection was covered by meropenem rx'ed for putative PNA. Foley 
catheter was left in place for comfort and abx discontinued when 
patient transitioned to comfort measures only. 

#CHF: Patient has known CHF likely of ischemic nature given CAD, 
found to have persistent LVEF 40-45% on TTE ___. Increased 
volume with IVF for hypercalcemia tx led to increasing dyspnea 
treated with oxygen supplementation, which improved after 
diuresis and PNA tx as above. At this point, IVF held as calcium 
dropped and for comfort reasons. 
 
#DVT in LLE: Left superficial femoral vein DVT found on last 
admission, discharged on SQ heparin for tx. Previously presented 
with acute worsening of LLE edema but now reduced compared to 
prior admission. LLE U/S shows unchanged partially occlusive 
clot of proximal superficial femoral vein. Anticoagulation held 
given thrombocytopenia, IVC filter placement held given 
stability of clot and goals of care. 

#Hyperuricemia: Uric acid on presentation 9.5. Pt treated on 
last admission with rasburicase and started on allopurinol and 
febuxostat. Discharged with uric acid 8.7. Febuxostat held on 
this admission due to drug rash. Elevated uric acid possibly due 
to worsening renal function in the setting of hypovolemia but 
given rising BCR-ABL and known CML->AML progression likely due 
to rapid cell turnover. Elevated uric acid unlikely to be 
contributing to poor kidney function given no urate crystals on 
urine sediment. Treated with rasburicase x1, uric acid dropped 
to but rose to 9.6 over several days. Allopurinol discontinued 
after patient transitioned to comfort measures only. 

#CKD: Baseline Cr 1.5-2.0 due to thrombotic microangiopathic 
injury with severe interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy 
possibly related to TKI shown on renal biopsy ___. Cr 2.2 on 
last discharge, presented with Cr 2.9. Most likely prerenal in 
the setting of poor po intake and hypovolemia; elevated uric 
acid unlikely to be causing renal damage after improvement with 
fluids and no urate crystals. Cr worsened to 2.5 after several 
doses of IV lasix. Urine output decreased ___. Further 
diuresis held, no further IVF or intervention to improve kidney 
function after transition to comfort care only. 

#GVHD: Known skin, gut, liver, muscle involvement. Aldolase 
mildly elevated consistent with known muscle disease but 
improved from ___. Rash likely drug related over acute GVHD 
per derm bx. Continued on prednisone 10mg then transitioned to 
4mg IV solumedrol BID given inability to tolerate PO prior to 
discontinuation of steroids given goals of care. 

#CAD s/p CABG: History of ?NSTEMI in past, ___ TTE with 
preserved EF 55%. ASA held due to thrombocytopenia. 

#Nutrition: Patient's weight has fallen from 141 to 127 lbs 
since ___, likely ___ poor PO intake. Copper level wnl, 
B6 low. Supplemented with ensure while taking PO prior to 
transition to comfort care.  

#Hypertension: 
-Stable on metoprolol and amlodipine until transition to comfort 
care at which point both rx dc'ed. 

Patient sadly died overnight ___ with her family 
present after comfort care for about 3 days.
