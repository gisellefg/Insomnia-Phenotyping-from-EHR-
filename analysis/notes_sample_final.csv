trying to communicate something important.  He exhibited 
paranoia
asking for a glass of water and then refusing it three times
because it had been spit in.  He was evasive and guarded and
repeatedly suggested that the interviewers would burn in hell 
and
stated that he spoke to god daily and that he knew how to speak
in tongues.  He was easily distractible asking if we thought it
interesting that the sheets had the word ___ printed on

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt. medically cleared and admitted to ___ inpatient 
psychiatry service after spending 2 days in ED for agitated 
behavior requiring multiple chemical restraints. Patient 
evaluated upon arrival to unit and placed on 15 min checks. Pt. 
refused to sign a CV.

Psych: Pt. initial presentation consisted of psychotic symptoms, 
namely grandiose and paranoid delusions, of being ___ the 
___, being able to speak in tongues, thinking people had 
spit in his water. ___ also beleived that he could read the 
mind of the the young girl he pushed and believed that she was 
making fun of his breasts and acne scars. He consistently denied 
any auditory hallucinations. ___ thought disorder and 
disorganization of speech were quite striking during his initial 
presentation and early part of his hospitalization, 
characterized by extreme looseness of associations, bordering on 
pressured and angry derailed tirades. ___ also presented with 
noticeably flat affect despite his angry and irritable behavior 
early on in his admission. He initially refused to take any 
medication and denied anything was wrong. An affadavit for court 
commitment was filed prior to expiration of ___ and ___ 
was committed to unit for 45 days, and required to take 
medication. ___ was started on Geodon 40 mg BID, which was 
quickly titrated up to 60 mg BID and eventually 80 mg BID after 
5 days. He also received Ativan 1 mg q6 PRN anxiety and poor 
sleep which he used regularly. He tolerated the medications with 
minimal side effects, though some ? stiffness was noted and 
patient was given Cogentin as well with each dose of Geodon. In 
the second week of medication, ___ developed an episode of 
orthostatic hypotension and his dose was decreased to 60 mg BID 
for 1 week. His orthostatis resolved with increased PO intake, 
and ___ was able to be titrated back up to 80 mg BID, Cogentin 
was also d/c'd. It was felt Geodon would be an appropriate 
antipsychotic for ___ given its neutral metabolic profile, 
ability for IM dosing if needed, lower risk for EPS, and little 
risk of prolaction elevation (given concern over breasts). ___ 
responded very slowly over the first 2 weeks of medication, 
showing improvement in his thought disorder and speech 
organization. The most striking feature of ___ hospital 
course, though, were his marked negative sxs which seemed to 
worsen during his stay: flat affect, alogia, withdrawal, apathy, 
and demoralization. It was thought that ___ likely was 
suffering from post-psychotic depression. Through discussions 
about his presentation and literature review, it was thought 
___ might benefit from initiation of Mirtazapine to help with 
negative sxs. He was started on 15 mg HS. Unfortunately, ___ 
did not tolerate the medication well, and developed intolerable 
sedation. The medication was thus discontinued on ___.  The 
patient was continued on the Geodon 60mg PO BID which he 
tolerated and was also continued on Cogentin 1mg PO BID PRN and 
Ativan 1mg PO TID PRN. The patient was discharged with 
prescriptions for the above medications and with a plan to 
follow up with his psychiatrist in two weeks.

As far as Mr. ___ diagnosis. He is ___ yo male admitted with 
bizarre and agitated behavior, exhibiting grandiose and paranoid 
delusions, and severe thought disorder. Patient has a ___ year 
history dating back to age ___ of depressive sxs and obsessive 
traits, 1 pior SA, and suffered the loss of his mother to CA at 
age ___. Last ___ patient had ___ psychotic episode, initially 
thought to be manic as well, but from discussions with outpt. 
psychiatrist and viewing d/c summary, there is little evidence 
of a manic episode. Based on current presentation and past 
history, it appears that Mr. ___ is suffering from the early 
beginnings of Schizophrenia, likely paranoid type, with 
pronounced negative symptoms and subsequent post-psychotic 
depression.

In the future, if patient does not show adequate remission of 
symptoms with geodon, it may be reasonable to try Risperdone, 
given the availability of a long-acting injectable form. Also, a 
re-trial of Mirtazapine may also be a consideration in the 
future if ___ negative/cognitive sxs continue to be an issue, 
though a lower starting dose would be recommended with slow 
upward titration.

Medical: ___ initially complained is some hand pain and 
tingling in his right hand secondary to injury from concert. 
Physical exam of this region was benign. No imaging was felt to 
be necessary. Patient was managed with PRN Ibuprofen with good 
effect. One episode of orthostasis as noted above on unit, 
responded well to decrease in Geodon dose and increased PO 
intake. The patient did not experience any other medical issues 
during his hospitalization. His vitals were monitored daily and 
apart from the orthostatic episode remained stable. He will f/u 
with his PCP upon discharge.

Social: SW evaluation done on admission. SW in contact with 
family throughout stay. Conference call made with ___ and 
psychiatry resident during initial part of stay to discuss 
diagnosis, treatment, and likely dispo planning. Also, ___ 
court-ordered to contact ___ to bring school materials. 
Contact made and ___ of school came to bring ___ belongings 
and materials, thought ___ made the decision to not continue 
with school given his current hospitalization. Letter was 
submitted on his behalf in attempt to obtain refund of tuition.

superimposed mild congestion is also probable. There is no 
pleural effusion. 
The bony thorax is unremarkable. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
1. Cardiomegaly with probable mild congestion. 
.
___ CT abd/pelvis
IMPRESSION: 
1. No evidence of mesenteric ischemia. 
2. New bilateral perinephric stranding, a nonspecific finding. 
This may be 
related to medical renal disease. 
3. Reticulonodular opacities at the lung bases likely reflect 
edema 
superimposed on chronic interstitial lung disease. 
4. Cardiomegaly with right heart failure. 
5. Small volume ascites.  
.
___ CT head
IMPRESSION: 
  
1. No evidence of infarction or hemorrhage, allowing for the 
presence of 
intravenous contrast from the preceding abdominal/pelvic CT. 
.
___ CT head
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute hemorrhage or acute large 
vascular territory 
infarcts. Prominence of the ventricles slightly out of 
proportion to 
prominence of the sulci is unchanged compared to ___. 
Periventricular 
hypodensities may represent chronic small vessel ischemic 
disease, 
transependymal migration of CSF, or a combination of the two; 
comparison with 
earlier prior imaging, if available, may be helpful in assessing 
change over 
time. 
.
___ CXR
The heart is enlarged. Mitral valve replacement is present. The 
interstitial 
failure present on the prior chest ___ appears 
less marked but 
this could be due to technical differences and I suspect that 
some 
interstitial failure is still present. Atelectasis is again 
present. 
  
IMPRESSION: Persistent cardiomegaly, interstitial failure 
possibly better. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital course was as follows: 

In the ___, initial BP 80/palp per ___ RN. Given 500 cc bolus and 
BPs improved to 103/56. She continued to be fluid resuscitated 
with a total of 4L NS. NGL lavage performed with return of dark, 
coffee-grounds. Labs significant for Hct 29.8 (baseline mid 
30___s), INR 21.2, venous lactate 10.7, Cr 3.6 (baseline 1.4 - 
1.9), troponin 0.02, CK 81. The patient was given 2 units pRBC, 
2 units FFP, panoprazole 40 mg IV X 1, and vit K 10 mg IV X 1. 
Given elevated venous lactate, a CTA abd/pelvis was performed 
that showed no signs of mesenteric ischemia, bibasilar lung 
opacities, non-specific bilateral perinephric stranding possibly 
related to renal failure, and ascites, pericholecystic fluid, 
and RV enlargement suggestive of R sided heart failure. She was 
seen by GI consult and admitted to the MICU for further care.  
.
In the MICU, GI performed EGD and noted esophagitis/gastritis 
and to have large clot in stomach but no active bleeding. 
Hematocrit nadir was 27, transfused 2 units w/ appropriate 
increase. Reversed anticoagulation w/ vitamin K, now on heparin 
gtt as INR<2 w/o new bleeding. Also patient noted to have a 
history of interstitial lung disease (f/b Dr. ___ and 
does not have home O2 but currently w/ O2 requirement s/p IVF 
resuscitation on arrival given hypovolemic hypotension in 
setting of bleed. Her O2 requirement has been lessening w/ 
diuresis. The morning of transfer, the patient was noticed to be 
slightly confused and does have a h/o sundowing. A head CT was 
negative for bleed and then found +U/A so started ciprofloxacin 
which was changed to ceftriaxone for concerns of deleriogenesis. 

.
Please see the following problem list for the pt's course once 
called out to the medical floor:
.
*) Increasing O2 requirement: Likely ___ volume overload from 
diastolic heart failure in combination with known interstitial 
lung disease. s/p echo ___ with EF 60-70%. Pt received IV lasix 
to a goal of -1.5L for approx 5 days and was transitioned to PO 
lasix when no longer exhibited signs of fluid overload. She 
continued to have a fluctuating O2 requirement and NC was 
titrated to >93%. On discharge, patient was satting well on 2L 
off of lasix.
.
*) Upper GI bleed: In setting of supratherapeutic INR. s/p 2u 
pRBC. Resolved and Hct stable s/p transfusion and Vit K. EGD 
with esophagitis, gastritis, clot but no acute bleeding. 
Continued BID protonix. Daily hcts were stable and increased 
throughout stay.  
.  
*) Anti-Coagulation/MVR - Patient on IV heparin with goal 50-70 
for anticogagulation for MVR. Initially on coumadin 2mg QD, 
which was eventually increased to her home regimen of 10mg 
___ and 15mg ___. On discharge, INR was 3.1 and heparin gtt 
discontinued. Patient to have close follow up with ___ 
Clinic.
.
*) Confusion/dementia: Pt with occasional severe agitation. Last 
episode ___ AM (pulled out IVs, refusing PO meds and O2NC). 
Likely secondary to underlying dementia/sundowning. Pt received 
zyprexa and haldol prn. Per daughter, this is her baseline.
.  
*) Acute on chronic renal failure: Prerenal, baseline Cr 
1.4-1.6. Followed Cr daily. On discharge, creatinine was 1.5.
.  
*) Cardiac - EF 60-70%. Continued metoprolol and transitioned to 
XL. Lisinopril was decreased as BPs were low normal. Continued 
statin.
.
*) UTI: Pt received cipro x 3d. Cx negative.
.  
*) s/p MVR - Mechanical valve. Heparin as above.  
.  
*) Hypothryoidism - Continued synthroid at home doses. TSH 0.68, 
free T4 normal.  
.  
*) DM II - Continue ISS while in house, but pt with little 
requirement. D/C'd on HD#12. Restarted metformin 1 day prior to 
discharge.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Syncope/Pre-syncope: The patient presented with pre-syncope 
likely either vasovagal or orthostatic in origin based on 
history. EKG was unchanged from previous and troponins were 
negative. The patient was admitted and placed on telemetry. She 
was noted to be bradycardic into the ___ and her Toprol XL 
was held with improvment in her heart rate to the ___. It 
was thought that the pre-syncope could be a combination of 
diabetic dysautonomia and orthostasis secondary to excessive 
beta blockade. The patient did not have any further pre-syncopal 
episodes while in the hospital, nor was she orthostatic based on 
vital signs. She was discharged to follow up with her PCP as an 
outpatient for further managment of her medications.

# Diabetes mellitus: Pt's HbA1C was 6.6 in ___. Because of 
her elevated creatinine, the patient's metformin was 
discontinued and she was started on an insulin sliding scale 
while in the hospital. She should follow up as an outpatient for 
further management of her diabetes.

baseline.

# Anemia: Pt's Hct is 34.8 which is around her baseline of 
___.

# Hypothyroidism: Free T4 is normal, TSH is on the lower limit 
of normal. ___ need to adjust synthroid as an outpatient.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Patient will likely need a repeat echocardiogram to evaluate 
valvular heart disease. Last echocardiogram was in ___ and 
showed no signs of aortic stenosis.

 The patient is status post median sternotomy and cardiac valve 
replacement.  Mediastinal contours are stable.  There is 
againmild prominence of the main pulmonary artery.  The cardiac 
silhouette is top normal.  There is mild diffuse increase in 
interstitial markings bilaterally, which may be due to mild

4.  Fibroid uterus. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Impression: Ms. ___ is an ___ yo woman with a hx of DMII, s/p 
MVR with baseline CKD who presents with elevated INR and ___.

**ACUTE ISSUES**
# Coagulopathy with Supratherapeutic INR: INR reported to be 9.2 
from outside laboratory and patient referred to ED, where INR 
was found to be 12.5. This is most likely due to combination of 
poor PO intake and inappropriate medication use. Patient found 
to be hypotensive in ED to SBP in the ___ and CT abd/pelvis was 
done to r/o bleeding. Patient given 5mg vitamin K and INR was 
allowed to drift down to 4.9, at which point warfarin was 
restarted at 2.5mg. INR continued to drift down to 3.5 and her 
dose was increased to 5mg at discharge in order to remain 
therapeutic. She will need an INR check on ___.

# Weakness and anorexia: Patient describes emotional decline 
since her husband died in ___ and she has lost 10 lbs since 
___. Although she reports good social support from family 
and friends, she lives alone and cooks for herself. 
Rehabilitation was discussed, per ___ notes, but patient 
declined this option.

# Hematuria: noted on exam on HD2 while Foley was in place. UA 
was not consistent with UTI; Hct remained stable and hematuria 
resolved with observation. 

# Acute on chronic kidney disease: Likely due to poor PO intake. 
Patient's baseline creatinine likely ~1.8-2.0 and on admission 
was 2.6. Resolved with IVF and was 1.9 at discharge. Lisinopril 
and Lasix were held in this setting. 

**CHRONIC ISSUES**
# h/o diastolic heart failure: Most recent echo in ___ 
showed normal EF > 65% with normal LV thickness and cavity size. 
BNP was not markedly elevated. 

# Interstitial lung disease: Pt has been reluctant to consider 
intervention for tissue diagnosis, oxygen was continued at ___.

# T2DM: most recent A1c was 6.3% on ___ and is diet 
controlled without the use of any oral medications. 

# h/o afib: Appears to not be an issue since valve replacement 
and is not on any rate control medication.

# hypertension: Lisinopril and Lasix were held as above, blood 
pressure was well-controlled during hospitalization at SBP of 
100 - 120.

# hypothyroidism: continued home levothyroxine.

# HLD: continued home simvastatin

# GERD: continued home omeprazole

**TRANSITIONAL ISSUES**

2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ 
mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The 
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Sub-optimal endocardial 
visualization; within this limitation, there appears to be mild 
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis 
of the basal to mid anterolateral wall and entire inferolateral 
wall. The apex is not well seen. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is 
no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Trivial mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

response in the presence of beta blocker therapy. No 
exercise-induced VT 
with only 2 isolated VPBs noted during the procedure. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
================================
___ with history of 3VD-CAD who elected PCI, now s/p DES to LM, 
LAD, and RCA presenting with substernal chest pain earlier 
today, found to have mild troponin elevation with new ST 
depression (V3), and is s/p PCI w/ POBA of D1 branch of LCA and 
was chest pain since then, but noted to have asymptomatic NSVT 
(38beats) x 1 episode

ACTIVE ISSUES:
================================
#CAD
Pt has known hx of 3VD-CAD who elected PCI (vs CABG), who 
previously was s/p DES to LM, LAD, and RCA who presented on this 
admission with substernal chest pain, was found to have mild 
troponin elevation with new ST depression (V3), and is now s/p 
PCI w/ POBA of D1 branch of LCA.

Subsequent to PCI, pt remained CP free but was noted to have 
asymptomatic NSVT (38beats) x 1 episode, that was not in the 
setting of any electrolyte abnormalities. See below for 
evaluation/treatment details. 

Otherwise, pt was continued on ASA, Plavix, Atorvastatin, and 
was started on Metoprolol after long discussion. Pt has listed 
allergy to Metoprolol but in actuality he avoids it as it made 
his depression worse in the past. Though in light of the 
frequency of his anginal episodes, the benefits of Metoprolol 
clearly outweighed the risks. For this reason, Metoprolol was 
started with the patient's permission.

#NSVT
Subsequent to PCI, pt remained CP free but was noted to have 
asymptomatic NSVT (38beats) x 1 episode, that was not in the 
setting of any electrolyte abnormalities.

Accordingly, pt had exercise stress test which showed no 
exercise induced VT with only 2 isolated VPBs noted during the 
procedure. He also had TTE which showed LVEF 45-50%, mild 
symmetric LVH, mildly depressed LV function, mild regional LV 
systolic dysfunction w/ hypokinesis of basal to mid 
anterolateral wall and entire inferolateral wall. 

Given such findings, it was felt that pt may have either 
arrhythmogenic scar tissue in the inferiolateral wall or 
infiltrative process (ex: sarcoid) that may predispose him to 
arrhythmias. Accodingly, he was discharged to home with 
outpatient cardiology follow up and was scheduled for elective 
outpatient cardiac MRI (to evaluate for previously mentioned 
etiologies).

CHRONIC ISSUES:
============================
#Hypertension:  
Patient with history of hypertension, and was mildly 
hypertensive upon arrival but remained within an acceptable 
range on home dose lisinopril, chlorthalidone and metoprolol. OF 
note, amlodipine was stopped during this admission given 
addition of Metoprolol Succinate.

#Obstructive sleep apnea:  
Patient with history of sleep apnea, and uses CPAP at home. He 
did not bring his machine with him so was provided with one 
which he used nightly.

#Anxiety/depression:  
Well-controlled currently so was continued on home regimen 
(lithium, ativan, prozac).

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
============================
1. Given inferior wall motion abnormalities, pt will need 
cardiac MRI to determine whether arrhythmogenic scar or 
infiltrative disease exists, that could account for NSVT. 
Cardiac MRI office will call pt next week to schedule elective 
study.
2.Pt will need to attend f/u with PCP for general healthcare 
maintenance
3.Pt will need to f/u w/ his cardiologist regarding his anginal 
symptomatology s/p PCI. Moreover, he will need to have his 
B-Blocker titrated as needed.

Discharge Instructions:
Dr. ___,

___ was a pleasure taking part in your care at ___.  You were 
admitted with chest pain.  You underwent a cardiac 
catheterization and underwent a balloon angioplasty.  We noted 
that you had a run of ventricular tachycardia, a dangerous heart 
rhythm.  Your resting echo looked slightly different that prior 
studies, so you underwent a repeat partial stress test.  You had 
2 VPBs and no inducible ventricular tachycardia.  We recommend 
you have an outpatient cardiac MRI to evaluate your heart 
muscle. Our office will call you next week to schedule an 
appointment that fits into your schedule.

Given your heart disease and ventricular tachycardia, we think 
it is very important that you take metoprolol.

History of Present Illness:
___ F w/ h/o HTN, lower extremity edema and afib on coumadin 
was brought in by family for concern of lethargy and found to be 
hyponatremic to 106. Pt had an unwitnessed fall on ___ 
but denies head strike or LOC. She briefly c/o posterior right 
shoulder which resolved shortly afterwards. Family noticed that 
pt had increasing fatigue and mild intermittent confusion over 
the past week. Her son said that on ___ they were able to 
complete a 2 block walk, longer than her usual walks, and did 
not experience SOB but felt fatigued afterwards. Pt has not had 
fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, dysuria, abdominal 
pain or bowel changes. However, family noted decreased appetite, 
po intake and urine output during this time. Pt lives alone and 
according to her son is normally quite functional and 
independently prepares her own food, reliably takes her 
medications and walks stably with a cane. Pt had complained of 
increased lower extremity edema during this time and in an 
effort to decrease edema pt reportedly decreased her fluid 
intake. When son stayed with his mother over the weekend and 
noticed decreased uop, the family recommended that she drink 
free water. Per family report she continued to take her 
prescibed doses of her medications, including ___ meds 
HCTZ, diovan and felodipine. Pt has had chronic lower extremity 
edema worsening over the past month and was evaluated by PCP ___ 
___ and ___. On both visits pt was found to have 3+ pitting 
edema in lower extremities with clear lungs and ___ 
JVP, not clinically determined to by volume overloaded. On ___ 
pt was found to be hyponatremic to 128 (baseline Na ___ over 
past year). PCP recommended compression stockings which she has 
not been compliant with, and discontinuation of felodipine 
however pt was hesitant to do so since she felt the CCB was 
improving her bp. Also of note, on ___, pt's weight was 131.5lbs 
(59 kilos) and had elevated INR of 4.7 (previously within ___ 
INR goal, on ___ INR 2.4).

intake found to be hyponatremic to 106 with altered mental 
status.
.
Severe symptomatic hyponatremia of unclear etiology, resolving
- admitted to the ICU for hypertonic saline and furosemide
- Nephrology consulted

lengthening and moderate TR, MR, pulmonary hypertension. EKG in 
ED did not show evidence of strain or ischemia. First set ___ 
and CKMB within normal limits. Repeat BNP was similar to prior, 
mildy elevated. Improvement in respiratory satus and decreased 
O2 requirement with iv lasix suggested some volume over load
- her lower extremity edema was ultimately attributed to her 
calcium channel blocker, so felodipine was held
.
HTN, diastolic CHF
- ___ management guided by Nephrology with PCP

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female admitted to the hospital with  abdominal 
pain, nausea, and elevated white blood cell count.  Upon 
admission, the patient was made NPO, given intravenous fluids, 
and underwent imaging which showed perforated appendicitis. She 
was started on a course of antibiotics ceftriaxone and flagyl 
and underwent serial abdominal examinations. 

The patient was taken to the operating room on HD # 3 where she 
underwent a laparoscopic appendectomy.  Intra-operative findings 
were notable for acute perforated appendicitis with phlegmon and 
an abscess.  There was a 100 cc blood loss.  The patient was 
extubated after the procedure and monitored in the recovery 
room.  

During the post-operative course, she was febrile with an 
elevated white blood cell count. Her surgical pain was 
controlled with intravenous analgesia. Because of the 
temperature spikes, the patient underwent a cat scan of the 
abdomen on POD #5 and she was reported to have a right lower 
quadrant collection.  She was taken to interventional radiology 
where a drain was placed. Her abdominal pain persisted and she 
underwent another cat scan of the abdomen which showed an 
additional fluid collection posterior to the uterus.  She

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain and found 
to have a perforation in your appendix. You were given IV 
antibiotics but continued to have pain and signs and symptoms of 
infection. You were taken to the operating room to have your 
appendix removed laparoscopically, and the infection washout out 
of your abdomen. After surgery, you continued to an elevation in 
your white blood cell count.  On imaging, you were reported to 
have fluid collections in your abdomen for which drains were 
placed.  Since then, your white blood cell count and your pain 
has decreased.  You continue on antibiotics.  Your are preparing 
for discharge home with ___ services for drain care assistance 
with the following instructions:

Please follow up at the appointment in clinic listed below. We 
also generally recommend that patients follow up with their 
primary care provider after having surgery. We have scheduled an 
appointment for you listed below.
ACTIVITY:
 
Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
You may climb stairs. 
You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until you 
see your surgeon at your next visit.
Don't lift more than ___ lbs for ___ weeks. (This is about the 
weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies to 
lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming.
 
HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
You may feel weak or ""washed out"" a couple weeks. You might want 
to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during surgery.
You could have a poor appetite for a couple days. Food may seem 
unappealing.
All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go 
away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your 
incisions. Under these dressings you have small plastic bandages 
called steristrips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks. 
(These are the thin paper strips that might be on your 
incision.) But if they fall off before that that's okay.
Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This is 
normal.
You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.
Do not use any ointments on the incision unless you were told 
otherwise.
You may see a small amount of clear or light red fluid staining 
your dressing or clothes. If the staining is severe, please call 
your surgeon.
You may shower. As noted above, ask your doctor when you may 
resume tub baths or swimming.
 
YOUR BOWELS:
Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain 
medicaitons. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as 
Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of 
magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain moving 
the bowels, call your surgeon. 
 
PAIN MANAGEMENT:
It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal 
surgery. This pain is often described as ""soreness"". 
Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain is 
getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.
You will receive a prescription for pain medicine to take by 
mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed. Do not 
take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take more 
medicine at one time than prescribed. Do not drink alcohol or 
drive while taking narcotic pain medication.
Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your 
pain gets too severe.
Talk with your surgeon about how long you will need to take 
prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain 
medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your 
surgeon has said its okay.
If you are experiencing no pain, it is okay to skip a dose of 
pain medicine.
Remember to use your ""cough pillow"" for splinting when you cough 
or when you are doing your deep breathing exercises.
If you experience any of the following, please contact your 
surgeon:
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours
- pain that is getting worse over time
- pain accompanied by fever of more than 101
- a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain
 
MEDICATIONS:
Take all the medicines you were on before the operation just as 
you did before, unless you have been told differently.
If you have any questions about what medicine to take or not to 
take, please call your surgeon.
 
DANGER SIGNS:
Please call your surgeon if you develop:
- worsening abdominal pain
- sharp or severe pain that lasts several hours
- temperature of 101 degrees or higher
- severe diarrhea
- vomiting
- redness around the incision that is spreading
- increased swelling around the incision
- excessive bruising around the incision
- cloudy fluid coming from the wound
- bright red blood or foul smelling discharge coming from the 
wound
- an increase in drainage from the wound

You will also need to follow-up with Dermatology to have 
excision of lesion left lower leg.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with history of CAD s/p CABG in ___ (___->LAD, 
SVG->diag->OM, SVG->PDA) and s/p NSTEMI in ___ with DES x3 
to RCA and POBA to D2 as well as hypertension and DM who 
presents with throat and chest pain. During this 
hospitalization, troponins were stable. Medical management of 
her CAD and anginal symptoms was optimized.
  
# CAD: Extensive CAD history with recent NSTEMI in ___ with 
DES to RCA. Symptoms on presentation (throat pain) are atypical 
for CAD, but prior NSTEMI had similar symptoms, making this 
concerning for an anginal equivalent. Troponins were <0.01, 
0.02, 0.02. Given her relatively stable troponins and her 
complicated cardiac anatomy, the decision was made to optimize 
medical management of CAD. She was continued on aspirin 325 mg 
and Plavix 75mg. She is also on Carvedilol 12.5mg BID, 
Lisinopril 20mg, and Imdur 90mg. Throughout this 
hospitalization, we attempted to better control the patient's 
hypertension on admission (180s/100s). 
 
# PUMP: TTE on date of discharge showed LVEF of 40-45%, largely 
unchanged from previous TTE in ___. Was euvolemic on exam.   

 
# RHYTHM: History of complete heart block s/p PPM. The patient 
was monitored on telemetry throughout the admission.  
 
# Hypertension: Blood pressure was elevated on admission to 
180s/100s. Patient had a good deal of anxiety on admission. She 
was unclear on which medications she had been taking most 
recently. By discharge, pressures had come down to 120s/80s. 
Hypertension medication regimen includes: Carvedilol 12.5mg BID, 
Felodipine 1.25 mg, Lisinopril 20mg. Discontinued outpatient 
atenolol 50mg (to simplify beta blocker regimen). Also increased 
Isosorbide Mononitrate 60mg to 90mg.
 
# Chronic Kidney Disease - Creatinine was elevated throughout 
admission, but close to baseline of 1.3-1.5. Renally toxic 
medications were avoided. 

# DM - Home medications were held during admission and the 
patient was on Insulin Sliding Scale. She will be discarghed on 
home meds.

CXR
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The 
lungs are 
clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or 
pneumothorax.  The 
patient is status post CABG.  Heart size is normal with stable 
cardiac and 
mediastinal silhouettes.   Pacemaker leads end in the expected 
locations of 
the right atrium and right ventricle. Hilar contours are normal.

to RCA and POBA to D2 as well as hypertension and DM who 
presents with chest pain and palpitations. 
 
#  chest pain/palpitations:  This patient was monitored in the 
ED and transferred to the cardiology floor for further 
evaluation.  She remained chest pain free during her hospital 
stay.  Her history and risk factors  raised some concern that 
chest pain may represent unstable angina given that it awoke her 
from sleep.  However, she demonstrated no elevation in trops x2 
and, her EKG was paced. On arrival to the floor she was 
hypertensive to 200 SBP.  She was continued on her home aspirin, 
plavix, Imdur, and statin and her home carvedilol was increased 
to 37.5 bid.  Her pacemaker was interrogated and revealed no 
significant tachyarrhthymia. The interrogation demonstrated 
normal device function. 81,024 PVCs  noted with 19 PVC runs 
without electrograms available for review. Rare PVCs were noted 
on telemetry.  It was ultimately felt that her chest pain may 
have been related to her hypertension she had no concerning EKG 
changes and no elevation of troponin.  

# Chronic  systolic congestive heart failure: Patients last echo 
in ___ showed 45%. Patient appeared euvolemic on exam this 
admission.  She was continued on  carvedilol (increase dose), 
lisinopril, and torsemide, and on a low sodium diet.   

#Complete heart block s/p pacer:  Patient was V-paced on 
admission, with a normal functioning device noted above.

# hypertension - Patient was hypertensive on admission with SBPs 
in the 180-210s.  She was continued on home doses of lisinopril, 
felodipine, carvedilol, imdur.  Her carvedilol dose was 
increased to 37.5 BID.  And her BP stabilized <160s.  

# diabetes type 2:  In house her home oral antihyperglycemics 
were discontinued and she was maintained on SSI and a diabetic 
diet in house.  On discharge she was restarted on oral therapy

CTA head and neck ___:
1. No evidence for acute intracranial abnormalities. 
2. No evidence for arterial dissection in the neck or 
intracranial compartment. 
3. Atherosclerotic plaque with moderate to severe stenosis of 
the right vertebral artery origin. Small focus of plaque in the 
proximal right V4 segment, distal to the right ___, with 
moderate narrowing of the remainder of the right V4 segment. 
4. Atherosclerotic plaque with mild narrowing of the left 
vertebral artery origin and P1 segment. Also calcified plaque in 
the proximal left V4 segment without flow-limiting stenosis. 
5. Atherosclerosis of bilateral proximal internal carotid 
arteries without flow-limiting stenosis. Atherosclerosis of

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo woman PMH CAD, diastolic HF ( mildly 
reduced EF 40-45%), PMR (on steroids), DM2, and per chart review 
a history of vertigo who presented with sudden onset of 
dizziness and vomiting. 

# Vertigo: Ultimately cause was unclear but resolved. She was 
seen by the Neuro Stroke team and had CT head as well as CTA 
head and neck which showed no evidence of acute intracranial 
abnormality or vertebral dissection. There was evidence of 
atherosclerotic disease. Acute stroke was therefore thought to 
be unlikely.  She was found to be orthostatic in the ED and 
received 1.5 L of IVF.  She was admitted to medicine and placed 
on telemetry; she had no events. The Electrophysiology Service 
was consulted to interrogate her pacemaker and her pacemaker was 
found to be working fine. ___ maneuver did not reproduce 
her symtoms making BPPV less likely. She was seen by physical 
therapy who recommended that she was safe for discharge with 
home physical therapy.  If persistently orthostatic, would check 
AM cortisol level to evaluate for adrenal insufficiency, 
especially since she is on long-standing Prednisone.

# Blurry Vision: Ms. ___ also noted that she had new blurry 
vision. Ophthalmology was consulted and blurry vision had nearly 
resolved. They believed vision changes may be related to dry 
eyes and recommended artificial tears QID, with Ophthalmology 
follow-up in 1 week. 

# ___: On HD2 she had an increase in her creatinine from 1.4 to 
2.1. This was thought to be contrast induced nephropathy vs. 
prerenal. Her lisinopril was held x 1 day. She was given IVF and 
creatine improved with creatinine at discharge 1.4 consistent 
with pre-renal rather than contrast-induced nephropathy.  Her 
lisinopril was restarted on discharge. 

# Nightsweats: Reported on admission. This was not worked up as 
inpatient, but this should be followed up as an outpatient.  

Chronic Issues:

# CAD: S/p CABG and PCI, s/p dual chamber pacemaker 
- continued home medications: carvedilol, plavix, aspirin, 
rosuvastatin

# HTN: continued torsemide and lisinopril (except x 1 day in 
setting of ___.  

# DM2: held home hypoglycemics, placed on insulin sliding scale  


 
===============================================================
Transitional Issues:
===============================================================
- Please check A1c and lipid panel at next PCP appointment for 
CVA risk factor optimization
- Lisinopril was held x 1 day given ___ with Cr to 2.1 and 
restarted prior to discharge after return of Cr to baseline, 
would recommend repeat chem 7 at next PCP appointment to ensure 
Cr stable
- periapical lucencies in the maxilla and mandible noted on CTA, 
would recommend dental follow-up as outpatient 
- she was complaining of night sweats during this admission, 
would recommend following up as outpatient and consider further 
malignancy work-up 
- may consider titrating down lisinopril if has persistent 
episodes of vertigo 
- should f/u with Ophthalmology 1 week after discahrge. 
Appointment currently being scheduled
- if patient continues to have orthostatic hypotension, would 
send AM cortisol to evaluate for adrenal insufficiency

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo woman ___ significant for CAD s/p CABG 
and PCI, dCHF (EF 40-45% in ___, Polymyalgia Rheumatica, DMII, 
depression, hypothyroidism who initially presented with chest 
pain and admitted for vertigo. 

Chest pain:  patient reported intermittent non-exertional chest 
pain over site of PPM. In the ED, PPM was evaluated by EP and 
found to be without issue. EKG was unchanged and troponin x 2. 
She had no more chest pain during her hospitalization. We 
decided not to perform a stress test given the atypical nature 
of her symptoms. She will follow with her cardiologist next 
month. 

Vertigo:  she reported symptoms were similar to her symptoms one 
year prior (patient was admitted for vertigo in ___. On 
arrival to the medicine floor she had unsteady gait. Cerebellar 
exam was normal and she had no other new focal deficits on neuro 
exam. Of note, she has chronic right sided weakness from prior 
stroke. ___ did reproduce her symptoms and Epley 
maneuver made her feel better.  Patient felt better on HD2 and 
was discharge home with home ___.  

Chronic Issues: 

CAD: S/p CABG and PCI, s/p dual chamber pacemaker. Pacemaker was 
evaluated in the ED and working properly. 
- Continued home medications: carvedilol, clopidogrel, aspirin, 
rosuvastatin. Of note patient reported she was only taking 25 mg 
carvedilol per day so gave her 12.5 mg BID and recommended this 
dose at discharge.
- Home isosorbide mononitrate divided 15 mg BID.

# HTN: 
- Continued felodipine, torsemide and lisinopril 

# DM2: 
- Held home glimepiride and linagliptin, placed on insulin 
sliding scale  

# Polymyalgia rheumatica:
- Continue home prednisone

Transitional Issues:
===========
- patient does not appear to be taking her carvedilol as 
prescribed, she has been taking 25 mg daily. We therefore 
changed her to 12.5 g daily at discharge. Please follow BP at 
next visit.
- she was give Rx for Meclizine at discharge
- chest pain: very atypical would recommend outpatient follow-up

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with a PMHx of CAD s/p multiple 
coronary interventions and pacemaker placement in ___ (hx of 
CHB), CKD, sCHF (LVEF 40-45% ___, and DM (last HbA1C 8.1% 
___, who presented to ___ with 8 weeks of poor PO intake 
after suddenly losing her long-time partner, found to have ___ 
on CKD, admitted for failure to thrive, fluid repletion and 
SW/psych counseling found to have major depressive disorder 
started on tx and supplemented nutritionally. She reported doing 
much better prior to d/c.

ACUTE ISSUES:

# ___ on CKD:
Pt with admission BUN/CR of 82/2.6, up from 76/1.96 on ___, and 
elevated from a reported baseline of 70/1.8 (hc DM2/HTN), in the 
setting of decreased PO intake for 8 weeks with ongoing 
diuretic/afterload reduction administration. Given BUN/Cr>20 
ratio and FeNa<1% consistent w/ pre-renal. Received multiple IVF 
boluses which worked to improvement her Cr in the right 
direction, and was d/ced with Cr 2.0 near baseline and expected 
to down-trend.

# Failure to thrive:
# Major depressive disorder:
Patient recently had a significant loss, her partner of ___ 
passed away unexpectedly in ___. No SI/HI. Patient describes a 
wealth of family support. ___ still be bereavement however 
meeting DSM-V criteria for ___. This is in the context of 5 
SIGECAPS positives, including depressed mood and anhedonia, with 
>2 weeks in duration and which cannot be accounted to by grief 
given functional decline to the point of hospitalization 8 weeks 
from partner's passage. TSH WNL. Underwent SW visit to which she 
responded well and agreed to continue with outpatient therapy. 
Discussion w/ PCP office on ___ yielded that she has not 
attempted pharmacotherapy for ___ prior and they are in 
concurrence she may benefit from SSRI initiation which they can 
follow. She was thus started on sertraline 50mg PO daily with 
first dose on date of d/c (___) and counseled on the need to 
wait a latency period prior to efficacy of the medication. She 
was seen by nutrition who recommended MVM and supplements with 
meals (ensure enlive) to promote caloric and protein intake.

# Hypoglycemia:
i/s/o DM2 (c/b CKD and diabetic retinopathy): She reports finger 
stick blood glucose levels of 50-100 each morning with several 
<70, suggesting that her DM medications may be overdosed. This 
may be further complicated by her recent decreased PO intake. 
Held home glimepiride and linagliptin in house, and placed on 
moderate ISS. However, seen by ___ on ___ who placed her on 
mild ISS and plan to d/c home glimepiride on discharge. FSG well 
controlled on date of d/c.

CHRONIC ISSUES:

# Hypertension
Held home carvedilol, felodipine, lisinopril, torsemide, and 
isosorbide mononitrate

# CAD 
Continued home clopidogrel (s/p remote stenting, cardiologist 
has continued given her significant CAD), ASA 81mg, 
rosuvastatin. Held coreg and imdur given relative hypotension 
and HRs ___.

# HFrEF (LVEF 40-45% ___:
Patient likely has some degree of ischemic cardiomyopathy. She 
currently did not appear volume overloaded on exam, gave careful 
IVF boluses iso ___ on CKD as above. Held home torsemide given 
concern for prerenal azotemia, home carvedilol given relative 
hypotension and HRs ___, and home lisinopril/felodipine/imdure 
given relative hypotension.

Continued home rosuvastatin.

# History of CHB s/p PPM placement:
Recently interrogated ___, Baseline ECG as above.

# Normocytic anemia:
Most likely AoCD with additional component of decreased epo 
production ___ CKD. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[ ] Her home lisinopril and torsemide and CCB were held in 
setting ___ and volume depletion, pls consider restarting at 
next visit given HFrEF if she is clinically capable of taking 
them. Beta-blocker, nitrate restarted at d/c. consider switching 
her CCB to hydralazine as an outpt for additional mortality 
benefit.
[ ] Will need screening colonoscopy
[ ] consider referral to psychiatry/psychology therapy follow-up 
as an outpatient per SW, and dual treatment for ___
[ ] f/u w/ PCP to gauge ___ symtpoms from time of SSRI 
intitiation and titrate as needed
[ ] Please obtain BMP at next visit to ensure Cr back to 
baseline (d/c Cr 2.0)
[ ] Patient with anemia, pls follow up CBC at next visit (d/c Hb 
10.0)
[ ] Patient with finger stick values prior to d/c of low 100's
[ ] the patient's pacemaker mode has been changed during this 
visit to avoid non-paced p-waves. please follow up with

History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ year old patient with a past medical history of CHB 
s/p PPM and CAD who is admitted with sudden onset of dizziness 
and lightheadedness with flushing while sitting visiting her son 
in the hospital.  

Her son is currently in the CCU with severe neurologic 
dysfunction after a code. She reports she has not been able to 
eat for at least one week and has been drinking water only. She 
has continued to take her glyburide through the last week. She 
states she was sitting at his bedside and had acute onset of 
flushing like her head was swelling. She also had some dizziness 
and diaphoresis with overall anxiety. This lasted up to 30 
minutes though she can't really quantify the time because she 
was very nervous to stand after the episode. She therefore went 
to the ED for evaluation. She notes that this occurred just 
after eating chicken from the cafeteria and reports that this 
was her first real meal in a week.

She denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, tunnel vision or 
other change in vision, tinnitus, spinning sensation, weakness, 
abdominal pain or other complaints. She was asymptomatic once 
her symptoms resolved on arrival to the ED.  

Per report, EP was curbsided in ED. As she had no complaints of 
chest pain or palpitations as a recent interogation, they did 
not feel her symptoms were consistent with CHB or PPM issue and 
requested medicine admission for presyncope workup.  

As above, the patient's PPM was last interogated one month ago 
(___) with no abnormalities noted. She was a-sensed, V-paced 
with underlying rhythm of CHB and no tachyarrythmias noted.  

In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.0 P 61 BP 175/77 R 16 O2 sat 
100% on RA. She did not receive any medications or IVF per ED 
notes. She was sent to the floor for management.  

On the floor, she is quite tearful at being separated from her 
son. She denies any current symptoms. She is very anxious and 
depressed. When asked, she states ___ in ___ has been following 
along with her and has been a tremendous help. She has no 
complaints and is willing to try broth and toast to eat. FSBG is 
125.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old female with history of CAD s/p CABG and 
CHB status post PPM placement who is admitted with an episode of 
dizziness and flushing while in the midst of a family tragedy. 
This patient had spent the previous week at her son's bedside 
during his hospitalization in the CCU.

# Presyncope: Most likely due to hypoglycemia from combination 
of not heating and taking her glyburide or hypotension from 
volume depletion. Mildly elevated creatinine suggests 
hypovolemia. EP consulted and interogated pacer, no evidence of 
failure. Cardiac enzymes cycled with no elevation. Treated with 
IV fluids, 

# Acute Renal Failure: pre-renal etiology. Treated with IVF. PO 
intake encouraged.

# CAD s/p CABG: Patient was continued on BB, ASA, lisinopril, 
atorvastatin.

# DM type 2: Metformin was held given creatinine of 1.4. Insulin 
sliding scale was given. Glyburide was held with concern for 
hypoglycemia as patient was not willing to eat much. On 
discharge we instructed her to hold her glyburide until further 
notice given her likely continued decreased oral intake.

Studies:
___:
CT neck w/o contrast:
IMPRESSION: No acute abnormality identified within the limits of 
this 
non-contrast examination. Prominent lingual tonsils and palatine 
tonsils and mild fullness in the left piriform sinus- correlate 
with clinical examination. Deg. changes in c spine.  
.
___: 
CXray:
No acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
___:
TTE:
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left 
ventricular cavity size is normal. LV systolic function appears 
depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to severe 
hypokinesis/akinesis of the septum, anterior free wall, and 
apex. The lateral wall may also be hypokinetic but was 
suboptimally visualized. Right ventricular chamber size and free 
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve is not well seen. There 
is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial 
mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial 
effusion. 

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) 
of ___, the extent of contractile dyfunction in the 
interventricular septum and anterior free wall is increased. 
However, hypokinesis in these walls was present in the prior 
study, as was severe hypokinesis of the apex.

COMMENTS:      
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system 
demonstrated 3 vessel native coronary artery disease.  The ___ 
had no 
angiographically apparent flow-limiting disease.  The LAD had an 
80% 
mid-vessel lesion followd by a total occlusion at D2.  The LCx 
had a 70% 
hazy, proximal OM2 stenosis.  The RCA had an 80% ostial stenosis 
and 
diffuse 90% in-stent restenosis. 
2.  Arterial conduit angiography demonstrated a patent LIMA0LAD. 

3.  Venous conduit angiography was not performed as both SVGs 
are known 
to be occluded. 
4.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate systemic 
systolic 
arterial hypertension with an SBP of 157mmHg. 
5. Successful PTCA and stenting of ostial, proximal and mid RCA 
with 
three overlapping drug eluting stents (2.5x23 Promus, 2.5x18mm 
Promus 
and 3.0x18mm promus distal to proximal). The 2.5mm stents were 
postdilated with 2.5mm NC balloon and 3.0 postdilated with 3.0mm 
NC 
Balloon. 
6. Successful hemostasis of left radial arteritomy with TR band. 

  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Three vessel native coronary artery disease with severe 
native LCx 
and RCA disease. 
2. Patent LIMA-LAD. 
3. SVG x 2 known to be occluded. 
4. Moderate systemic systolic arterial hypertension. 
5. Successful PCI of RCA with DESx3 
6. Successful LRA TR band. 
.
___:
REPEAT LHC:
1. Limited hemodynamic study showed aortic pressure of 127/73/90 
mm Hg. 
2. Selective coronary angiography was performed via right radial 

arterial access using a ___ Fr sheath. A ___ Fr JR 4 catheter was 
used to 
obtain a right coronary angiogram. Diagnostic left ___ 
angiography 
and subsequent intervention of the left coronary arterial system 
was 
carried out using an XB 3.0 ___ Fr guide catheter (an XB 3.5 
catheter 
proved to be oversized). 
3. The right coronary artery showed patent stents with TIMI 3 
flow. 
4. The left main was widely patent with no significant stenosis 
(except 
for a calcified distal plaque). The LAD had a diffuse calcified 
80% 
stenosis in the mid-segment followed by complete occlusion at 
the level 
of the second diagonal. The second obtuse marginal had a 70% 
stenosis 
involving its origin. 
5. Successful balloon angioplasty of a subtotally occluded 
second 
diagonal with 30% residual stenosis. 
6. Fractional flow reserve study of the second obtuse marginal 
70% 
stenosis yielded a value of 0.84. 
  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease. 
2. Successful balloon angioplasty of a 99% sub-totally occluded 
second 
diagonal branch with 30% residual stenosis and TIMI 3 distal 
flow. 
3. Hemodynamically non-significant diffuse 70% stenosis at the 
origin of 
OM2 (FFR 0.84). 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old woman with a history of CAD (LIMA->LAD, 
SVG->diag->OM, SVG->PDA), RCA PCI in ___, possible prior 
inferior and apical MI, poorly controlled DM, poorly controlled 
HTN, prior CVA, diastolic CHF and HLD, CHB with DDD, who 
presents with throat pain and elevation of troponin now s/p 
stent x3 to RCA for ostial lesion and 90% ISRS, with return to 
cath lab for D2 POBA due to recurrence of throat pain and rising 
trops.  Had improvement in symptoms but still elevated troponin 
most likely ___ to demand myonecrosis with poor clearance ___ to 
___. 

# NSTEMI and Demand Myonecrosis:  Pt presented to ED with severe 
throat pain for third time in a matter of days. First two times 
trops were negative and stress tolerance test and MIBI showed no 
anginal symptoms and a known fixed apical wall defect unchanged 
to prior. ECGs uninterpretable due to vpaced rhythm from 
patient's pacemaker for complete heart block. On this admission, 
pt worked up with CT neck which was negative.  However, troponin 
found to be elevated.  It is likely that her throat pain is her 
coronary equivalent given patient's diabetes.  Echo demonstrated 
worsening anterior and septal wall motion abnormalities with 
suboptimal view of lateral wall.  Trops peaked at 1.8 and the pt 
was classified as having an NSTEMI.  An invasive approach was 
indicated given elevated trops, prior CABG, and high TRS of 6. 
Cath revealed an RCA ostial stenosis ISRS of RCA, and these were 
treated with 3 DES.  While in cath lab, pt became hypertensive 
and recurrence of throat pain and case was discontinued but note 
was made of an occluded D2 and 70% OM lesion.  Back on the 
floor, pt had worsening of throat pain and spiked troponins 
again.  In conjunction with the previous echo demonstrating 
worsening wall motion abnormalities over left anterior wall, 
septum, and possibly lateral wall (suboptimally visualized) this 
suggested another potential culprit lesion outside of the RCA. 
Pt went back to cath lab on following day where OM2 showed good 
FFR of 84% so was not intervened on, but occluded D2 was POBAed 
with improvement of pain.  However, the following night patient 
again developed neck pain in the setting of an elevated blood 
pressure to 190's/110's. She was started on nitro gtt which 
resulted in complete pain relief. She was gradually weaned off 
of the nitro gtt and remained pain-free.  She developed a more 
modest trop spike most likely due to demand ischemia in setting 
of hypertension.  The patient seems to be very sensitive to 
hypertension and easily develops demand myonecrosis most likely 
from her ischemic cardiomyopathy causing elevated O2 demand with 
decreased supply in setting of CAD and both systolic and 
diastolic dysfunction.  The patient's troponins were monitored 
and were on the decline at time of discharge.  It will be 
important to control patient's hypertension as hypertensive 
episodes cause her to have her coronary anginal equivalent 
throat pain.  For stent, pt to continue aspirin and plavix.  For 
CAD/HTN/Angina, pt on Coreg 25, Imdur 60, Atorvastatin 80, and 
lisinopril 20 mg.  Of note, Imdur causes the patient headache 
within first hour of taking.  Imdur just started, and pt may 
become tolerant of side effect with time, but should continue to 
monitor in case side effects become worse or intolerable.  She 
was advised to take the medication an hour before getting up to 
go to work.
.
# Acute on chronic systolic and diastolic dysfunction:  No signs 
of acute symptomatic heart failure.  LVEF is now worse and 
estimated to be 30%.  Pt to continue on Coreg 25 mg and 
Lisinopril 20 mg with increase of lisinopril as tolerated.
.  
# RHYTHM:  A paced V sensed throughout at rate in ___.
.  
# HTN: Continue on Coreg, Imdur, Lisinopril, with uptitration of 
lisinopril as renal function tolerates.  ___ from 
CIN, this was not further increased in the hospital.  Pt sent 
home with script for blood pressure kit for outpatient follow 
up.
.  
#  DMII: ISS while here.  Discharged on home meds as creatinine 
came back down to 1.2.
.  
#  Dyslipidemia: Switched crestor to atorvastatin 80 mg. Spoke 
to pharmacy, unfortunately copay is $99 for either medication.
.  
# ___: Pt developed CIN both times she was administered 
contrast.  This improved with time and hydration.
.  
# Incidentals:
- Elevated ALT: Workup as outpatient
- 4-mm pulmonary nodule along the right major fissure. In this 
location, 
this could represent a lymph node. In a low-risk patient, no 
further specific 
followup is needed. In a high-risk patient, followup CT at 12 
months may be 
performed.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___.  You were 
admitted for throat pain and were found to be having a heart 
attack.  You were treated with placement of 3 drug eluting 
stents into a heart artery called the right coronary artery.  
However, you continued to have pain and your cardiac markers in 
your blood demonstrated that you were having another small heart 
attack.  You were treated with dilation of one of your other 
heart arteries which improved your symptoms.  

Your blood pressure was also high on admission and your 
medications were changed to better control this.

The following changes were made to your medications:
START Plavix (clopidogrel) to prevent your stent from clotting
START Carvedilol (coreg) for better blood pressure control
STOP Atenolol
STOP Amlodipine
START Isosorbide Mononitrate (Imdur) for control of your pain 
and blood pressure control
INCREASE Lisinopril for better blood pressure control
START Nitroglycerin tabs to be used as needed for chest or 
throat pain
STOP Crestor
START Atorvastatin for heart attack
START Home Blood pressure monitoring

You must take your aspirin and plavix everyday without fail.  
Please do not ever stop taking it unless told by your 
cardiologist.

History of Present Illness:
Ms ___ is a ___ year-old female with history of 
schizoaffective disorder, history of stroke, and hypothyroidism 
who was admitted to the cardiology service on ___ with an 
NSTEMI and an acute stroke after a fall on the night of ___. 
Per the admit note she tried to go to the bathroom around 1 am, 
tripped and fell and wasn't able to get up. She was found in a 
prone position by an aide. Upon arrival in the ED she was 
reportedly dysarthric and neurology was consulted due to concern 
for stroke. She was also noted to have ___ upper extremity 
strength. CT head and ___ were initially negative for any 
acute process. EKG showed no ischmic changes, however trop 
returned 0.68 with a CK of 3362. She was admitted to ___ for 
NSTEMI on a heparin gtt.  
.  
On the floor she continued to have dysarthric speech. MRI of her 
brain was ordered which did show bilateral subacute ischemic 
changes in both basal ganglia and body of the caudate nucleus on 
the right with no hemorrhagic changes. CK's trended upwards, 
concerning for rhabdo and her Cr on admission was elevated, but 
has since trended downwards with IVF. Cardiology felt that her 
troponin leak was likely due to demand ischemia. Her heparin gtt 
was stopped shortly after admission. Neurology consult team has 
been following.  
.  
Ortho ___ had also been consulted due to the fall and she has 
had CT of her ___ which ___ significant canal stenosis 
which could predispose to cord trauma even after minor injury so 
a MRI of ___ was done to rule out acute cord injury which 
was limited due to motion artifact. Ortho ___ did subsequently 
clear her cervical ___ in the am of ___ and her collar was 
removed.  
.  
She was noted to have paradoxical breathing which initially 
improved after her cervical collar was removed, which 
subsequently worsened. With a respiratory rate is in the mid 
30___ and 95% oxygen saturation on a face mask, she was found to 
have a WBC 20K and repeat CXR showed right-sided opacity 
concerning for possible aspiration PNA.  She was started on 
vanc, cefepime, and flagyl prior to transfer to the medical ICU. 
 
.  
On arrival to the MICU she continued to have paradoxical 
breathing and was very lethargic. She was subsequently 
stabilized, and transferred back to the medical floor for 
continued management.

IMPRESSION: No evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process. Left 
upper lung opacity versus bony sclerotic focus could be further 
evaluated with non-urgent chest CT. 
.
CT ___ ___:
IMPRESSION: No fracture or malalignment noted. There is 
significant canal stenosis at C5-C6 due to an eccentric disc 
osteophyte complex which predisposes to cord injury even from 
minor trauma. Given apparent neurologic deficit, consider MRI 
for further evaluation to assess for cord injury, not assessed 
by CT. 
.
MRI Cervical ___ ___:
Limited examination due to motion artifact. Multilevel 
degenerative changes with most significant change at C5-6 level. 
Apparent signal abnormality within the cord may be real or 
artifactual. Repeat examination is advised once the patient is 
able to tolerate the exam or with conscious sedation. The change 
from wet read and findings/recommendations were communicated to 
Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 9:30 a.m. on ___. 
.
MRI head ___:
Bilateral subacute ischemic changes involving the basal ganglia 
bilaterally with extension into the body of the caudate nucleus 
on the right with no evidence of hemorrhagic transformation. 
There is no evidence of mass effect or hydrocephalus. 
.
CXR ___:
The NG tube tip is in the stomach. The ET tube tip is most 
likely 5 cm above the carina. There is worsening of the left 
lower lobe atelectasis. The enlargement of both pulmonary 
arteries is unchanged. The upper lungs are essentially clear.
.
ECHO ___:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, 
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal 
(LVEF 70%). The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. 
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline normal 
free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.  
.
CT Head ___:
IMPRESSION: Bilateral basal ganglial infarcts ( acute - subacute 
and a few 
chronic alcunar infarcts) without evidence of hemorrhagic 
transformation or hydrocephalus or significant mass effect. Pl. 
see prior MR for additional details.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year-old female with schizoaffective disorder, history of 
stroke, and hypothyroidism who was admitted on ___ with an 
NSTEMI and an acute stroke s/p hypercarbic respiratory failure 
secondary to aspiration PNA, who improved but had subsequent 
difficulties swallowing and PEG tube placement.  During the 
subsequent hospital course, the patient underwent speech therapy 
and continued to improve to the point of tolerating increasing 
PO trials prior to discharge to rehab.
.
# Stroke: The patient was found to have subacute strokes in her 
basal ganglia and caudate and had weakness and dsyarthria 
present on admission, which corresponded to her neurologic 
deficits. She was initially unable to cooperative fully with a 
neuro exam, but did have hyperreflexic reflexes on exam here.  
Neurology was consulted and recommended aspirin and plavix, 
which was held briefly around the time of her PEG placement.  An 
NG tube was attempted to be placed, but patient did not tolerate 
exam.  She failed speech and swallow multiple times.  A PEG tube 
was placed for tube feeding after serial discussions with the 
patient and family. Later in her hospital course, prior to 
discharge, a video swallow study was conducted, showing that she 
had regained some swallowing function and so pureed solids were 
started in addition to tube feeds. The patient will need serial 
speech and swallow evaluations at her rehab center to monitor 
her improvement and determine when, if at all, the PEG tube can 
be removed.
.  
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Thought to be secondary to 
aspiration pneumonia.  She finished a full 8 day course of 
vancomycin/cefepime/flagyl.  Respiratory status was stable once 
extubated.
.
# Spinal Stenosis: Patient had trauma CT on admission remarkable 
for severe spinal stenosis with some cord compression. ___ 
surgery was consulted and felt no acute need for surgery or 
steroids however when her condition improves will likely need 
surgery.  Initially had a hard collar in place, but after 
discussion with Ortho ___, felt that collar could be removed.  
Patient will need follow-up with Dr. ___ in Ortho ___ in 2 
weeks.
.
# Trop leak/Demand ischemia: The patient was initially admitted 
to cardiology and felt to have demand ischemia in the setting of 
recent fall and stroke. She was inititally treated with a 
heparin gtt which was stopped shortly after admissison as the 
cardiologists felt it was demand ischemia in setting of 
infection. Her enzymes trended down and no ECG changes were 
noted.  TTE on ___ showed normal systolic function with no wall 
motion abnormalities.
. 
# Acute kidney injury: Elevated Cr on presentation, but trended 
down with IVF. Likely secondary to prerenal intravascular 
depleption. 
.
# Urinary Retention: The patient was found to have urinary 
retention after extubation. She failed several voiding trials 
and so a foley was placed. The patient should have serial 
voiding trials at rehab to determine when the foley can be 
removed. 
.
# Nutrition: As noted, the patient underwent PEG placement. She 
was maintained on TPN pre-procedurally, while the patient and 
family considered placement of a PEG tube and while the patient 
deferred a dobhoff feeding tube.  The day prior to discharge, 
the patient was able to start PO trials after her video swallow 
study, and the goal was to gradually increase PO intake by 
transitioning to night-time feedings at rehab.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your 
hospitalization.  You were admitted after being found down at 
home.  After further work-up, it was determined that you had a 
stroke.  A CT scan of your neck also showed cervical spinal 
stenosis, or a narrowing of the spinal canal in your neck.  It 
was also thought that you were having a heart attack, however 
this ultimately was not felt to be true.  

Unfortunately, you had an aspiration event and were sent to the 
ICU where you were intubated.  You completed a course of 
antibiotics for an aspiration pneumonia and were able to be 
extubated without difficulty.  You failed several speech and 
swallow exams and needed a PEG tube placed to be able to use 
your GI tract.  This was placed by ___. You started slowly 
re-developing the ability to swallow and take some food by 
mouth. We hope that you will continue to improve your swallowing 
to the point that we be able to remove the PEG tube. 
.
You also developed urinary retention here in the hospital, and 
are being discharged with a foley. Your rehab center should 
continue to do voiding trials. We hope you will improve and we 
will be able to remove the foley.
.
We made the following changes to your medications:
STARTED Plavix
STARTED Senna
.
Please go to all of the appointments scheduled below.

___: Urine culture: no growth
.
IMAGING:
___ Chest x-ray PA/lat
FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. 
There are 
relatively low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis. No 
discrete focal 
consolidation is seen. There is no large pleural effusion or 
pneumothorax.  Prominence of the pulmonary arteries suggests 
possible pulmonary arterial hypertension. The cardiac silhouette 
is stable. 
.
___ Portable Abdomen, Gastrograffin study
FINDINGS: Single portable supine view of the abdomen shows the 
G-tube to be in the proper position. Contrast is seen entering 
through the tube into the body and pylorus of the stomach. There 
is a nonspecific bowel gas pattern with no evidence of ileus or 
obstruction. No intraperitoneal air is seen.  The imaged lung 
bases are unremarkable. Degenerative changes about the lower 
lumbar spine are present. 
IMPRESSION: Appropriate position of G-tube. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is an ___ year old lady, with a history of stroke, 
aspiration, schizoaffective disorder and hypothyroidism, 
admitted from ___ for evaluation of possible 
aspiration pneumonia, found to have a UTI.  Hospital course 
complicated by ___ and transient hypoxia.
.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# UTI: UA positive with WBCs and large ___, accompanied by 
leukocytosis to 16 with left shift.  Patient was started on 
ceftriaxone for treatment of UTI, and her Foley catheter was 
changed.  Her leukocytosis subsequently resolved.  As her urine 
culture is still pending, she will continue on empiric oral 
treatment with ciprofloxacin for a course of seven days.
.
# ___: Creatinine was initially elevated to 1.5 from baseline 
1.0, and resolved to 1.1 with IVF at the time of discharge.  
FENa was consistent with prerenal azotemia, likely from poor PO 
intake in the setting of UTI.  Foley was changed and was 
functioning well.  
.  
# Hypoxia: Patient transiently desatted to 88% at nighttime, 
requiring supplemental O2.  Etiologies include undiagnosed sleep 
apnea given body habitus, atelectasis, pneumonia, pleural 
effusion and PE.  CXR was unremarkable.  This is most likely a 
combination of possibly sleep apnea with a component of 
atelectasis.  Patient was given an incentive spirometer, 
encouraged to get out of bed to chair and weaned off of 
supplemental oxygen.  She was asymptomatic.
.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Enteral nutrition: G tube site clean, with gastrograffin study 
showing G tube in place.  Continued TFs with some modification: 
Isosource 1.5 @ 75 cc/hr, cycled every 12 hours, as her home 
regimen was overfeeding.
.  
# Hypothyroidism: continued home dose levothyroxine 
.  
# Schizoaffective disorder: continued home lithium
.
# Past CVA: Continued aspirin and clopidogrel
.  
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
1.) At the time of discharge, urine culture was still pending.  
Final result returned with no growth.
2.) Please change TFs to Isosource 1.5 @ 75 cc/hr, cycled every 
12 hours, as her home regimen was overfeeding.
3.) Patient is confirmed DNR/DNI.

___ ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT

___       ___ MRN:   ___       TTE (Complete) 
Done ___ at 1:06:05 ___      FINAL

The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal 
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall 
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Tissue Doppler 
imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure 
(PCWP<12mmHg). The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be 
determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally 
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall 
thickness with preserved global and regional left ventricular 
systolic function. No clinically significant valvular 
regurgitation or stenosis. Normal pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the right ventricle was previously dilated and hypertrophied 
with borderline normal systolic function; due to technical 
limitations the right ventricle was not well visualized on the 
current study and could not be compared. 

RIGHT INGUINAL LYMPH NODE
-Biopsy consistent with T-Cell lymphoma
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o F w/ h/o CVA, aspiration, schizoaffective disorder and 
hypothyroidism p/w 7 days of lethargy and report of fever at ___ 
home placed on 7 days of Levofloxacin for reportedly positive 
U/A w/ ?slight infiltrate on CXR at ___ home transfered to ___ 
for further management in setting of lack of clinical 
improvement now has condition consistent with aggressive T-cell 
lymphoma.

# T-cell lymphoma / Fever and malaise: on arrival objective temp 
of 101.0 reported in ED at ___ w/ hx of low grade temps of 
nursing home. Infectious and thrombotic  source for fevers was 
evaluated with completely negative workup (no UTI, pneumonia, 
diarrhea, wounds). Diffuse Lymphadenopathy found on CT imaging 
which was suspicious for lymphoma and was biopsied in setting of 
high calcium and LDH. The Hematology-Oncology Team at ___ 
relayed to our primary team that the pathology is consistent 
with an aggressive T-cell lymphoma that would unlikely respond 
to chemotherapy. In discussions with the family and health care 
proxy, the decision was made for comfort measures care and for 
hospice to be involved back at the nursing home. Her persistent 
fevers have revealed no infectious source and thus are being 
attributed to her cancer.

Cardiac catheterization
 
History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ year old male with a past medical history 
only significant for HLD who presented with chest pain.  The 
patient states that 2 weeks ago he experienced exertional, 
substernal chest pressure on exertion (occurred while playing 
basketball) which subsequently resolved after a few minutes. 
Within the past few days, he has noticed episodes of burning 
chest pain which he thought was due to GERD.  The episodes have 
been occuring both with activity and at rest and last a few 
minutes in duration.  He had been taking TUMs.  The night prior 
to admission he awoke 4 times in the middle of the night with 
the burning chest pain- each episode lasted about ___ minutes. 
 On the day of presentation he experienced the worst episode of 
substernal chest pressure and burning, which he rated at a ___ 
in severity.  He denied any dyspnea during these episodes.  He 
subsequently called EMS, was given 4 baby aspirin in the 
ambulence, and was brought to the ___ ED.

IMAGING
=======
CT abd.pelvis ___

COMPARISON:  None.
 
FINDINGS: 
 
VASCULAR:
 
There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm.  There is minimal calcium 
burden in the
abdominal aorta and great abdominal arteries.
 
LOWER CHEST: Minimal atelectasis is noted in the lung bases. 
There is no
pleural or pericardial effusion.
 
ABDOMEN:
 
HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation 
throughout. There
is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of 
intrahepatic or
extrahepatic biliary dilatation.  The gallbladder is within 
normal limits,
without stones or gallbladder wall thickening.
 
PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, 
without evidence of
focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no 
peripancreatic
stranding.
 
SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, 
without
evidence of focal lesions.
 
ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size 
and shape.
 
URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with 
normal nephrogram.
There is no evidence of stones, focal renal lesions, or 
hydronephrosis. There
are no urothelial lesions in the kidneys or ureters. There is no 
perinephric
abnormality.
 
GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach appears within normal limits.  
Small bowel loops
are normal in caliber without evidence of small bowel 
obstruction.  The
sigmoid colon again demonstrates wall thickening with 
diverticulosis and
surrounding inflammatory changes.  This is compatible with the 
patient's
diagnosis of diverticulitis.  Again seen is a fistula extending 
between 2
segments of sigmoid colon (series 9, image 133 through 139).  
There is an
extraluminal pocket of air again seen anterior to the sigmoid 
colon (series 9,
image 124).  A probable fistulous tract between the sigmoid 
colon and distal
ileum is again seen (series 9 image 116 through 120).
 
RETROPERITONEUM: There is no retroperitoneal hematoma.  
Prominent lymph nodes
are noted in the retroperitoneum.
 
PELVIS: There is air in the urinary bladder.  There is 
thickening of the
superior bladder wall which extends contiguously with the areas 
of
inflammation related to the patient's sigmoid diverticulitis.  
This is
unchanged from the prior exam.  Prominent lymph nodes are noted 
in the pelvis.
There is no free fluid in the pelvis.
 
REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The visualized reproductive organs are 
unremarkable.
 
BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or 
acute fracture.
 
SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal 
limits.
 
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma or acute bleed in the 
abdomen and
pelvis.
2. Unchanged findings of chronic diverticulitis in the sigmoid 
colon with a
fistula extending between 2 segments of sigmoid colon, a small 
contained
perforation anteriorly, a probable fistula with the distal ileum 
and reactive
changes in the adjacent superior urinary bladder wall.  However, 
given the
presence of air in the urinary bladder, a colovesicular fistula

INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fevers   abdominal pain, 
concern for
diverticulitis// please review CT ABD PELVIS from OSH uploaded 
into OMR- from
ct torso
 
TECHNIQUE:  CT scan of the abdomen with IV and oral contrast 
from ___ was imported into the ___ PACs and reviewed.
 
DOSE:  Found no primary dose record and no dose record stored 
with the sibling
of a split exam.
!If this Fluency report was activated before the completion of 
the dose
transmission, please reinsert the token called CT DLP Dose to 
load new data.
 
COMPARISON:  Total exam DLP: 741.16 mGy-cm
 
FINDINGS: 
 
LOWER CHEST: Minimal subsegmental atelectasis is seen at the 
right lung base. 
There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.
 
ABDOMEN:
HEPATOBILIARY: The liver parenchyma demonstrates homogeneous 
attenuation. 
There is no evidence of focal lesions.  There is no evidence of 
intrahepatic
or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.  The gallbladder is within 
normal limits.
 
PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, 
without evidence of
focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation.  There is no 
peripancreatic
stranding.
 
SPLEEN: The spleen is enlarged, measuring 15.9 cm, without focal 
lesions.
 
ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size 
and shape.
 
URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with 
normal nephrogram. 
There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis.  
There is no
perinephric abnormality.
 
GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable.  Small bowel 
loops demonstrate
normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout.  
Multiple small
diverticula are seen within the sigmoid colon, with marked 
segmental wall
thickening and surrounding inflammatory changes in keeping with 
chronic
diverticulitis.  A 0.9 cm pocket of gas anterior to the proximal 
sigmoid colon
(2:69) appears extraluminal, concerning for a focal contained 
perforation.  A
contrast containing tract is seen connecting the proximal and 
distal sigmoid
(2:73) in keeping with an inter-sigmoid fistula.  There is also 
a linear tract
containing contrast within the superior wall of the proximal 
sigmoid
(___), suspicious for a intramural fistula.  Additionally, 
there is
tethering of a loop of distal ileum to the proximal sigmoid 
___: 64)
concerning for a fistula.
 
There is also contact between the inferior aspect of the sigmoid 
colon and the
superior wall of the bladder, with thickening of the bladder 
wall (___: 78). 
There is no abnormal enhancing tract extending to the bladder 
mucosa and a
colovesicular fistula is unlikely.  However, a small amount of 
gas is seen
within the bladder but this may be related to recent 
instrumentation.  No
abscess or fluid collections are identified.  The appendix is 
normal.
 
PELVIS: There is no free fluid in the pelvis.
 
REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The visualized reproductive organs are 
unremarkable.
 
LYMPH NODES: There are multiple enlarged ___ lymph nodes 
measuring up to 1.5 x
1.4 cm (2:63).  There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy 
by size
criteria.
 
VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm.  No 
atherosclerotic disease
is noted.
 
BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or 
acute fracture. 
Bilateral spondylolysis of L5 is noted.
 
SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal 
limits.
 
 
IMPRESSION:
1. Chronic diverticulitis involving the proximal sigmoid colon.  
There is a
small pocket of extraluminal gas with surrounding inflammatory 
changes
concerning for a focal contained perforation.  No abscess 
collections are
identified.
2. There is an inter-sigmoid fistula between the proximal and 
distal sigmoid,
an intramural fistula within the proximal sigmoid colon, and a 
suspected
fistula between the proximal sigmoid and the distal ileum.  
Additionally, the
inflamed sigmoid colon is in contact with the roof of the 
bladder with
significant bladder wall thickening.  A colovesicular fistula 
seems unlikely
as no definite one is seen and there is thickened bladder wall 
between the
inflammation and the bladder lumen, however, gas is seen within 
the bladder
but this may be explained by recent instrumentation of the 
bladder.
3. Splenomegaly.
 
RECOMMENDATION(S):  Correlation with a history of recent bladder
instrumentation, such as insertion of a Foley catheter, is 
recommended to rule
out a colovesicular fistula.

RUQUS:
1. Normal appearance of the liver without focal lesion 
identified.
2. No evidence of intra or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.
3. Mild splenomegaly.
4. No ascites.

CROSSMATCH INFORMATION
======================
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with a previous diagnosis of 
both a warm and cold auto-antibody.
Work-up at ___ revealed a warm auto-antibody of undetermined
specificity. The cold auto-antibody was not assessed. No 
allo-antibodies
were identified following autologous adsorption. Auto-antibodies 
can
complicate the serological work-up of patients and cause delays 
in
providing compatible blood products. If blood products are 
needed,
please inform the Blood Bank as early as possible.
 
Given the complex serology, to simplify future workups, we will 
provide
ABO compatible, antigen negative units for Mr. ___.
Approximately 4% of ABO compatible blood will be E, c, K and 
Jka-antigen
negative. A blood sample will be sent to ___ every two weeks to 
assess
for new allo-antibody formation.

___ 06:42  ___ year old man with history of ETOH abuse and diverticulitis, 
as well as developmental delay, presenting initially for alcohol 
withdrawal, found to be febrile, with severe anemia due to warm 
AIHA, now transferred out of the ICU for further management.  

#Anemia:  Hgb 7.7 on initial presentation, rapidly falling to 
5.5 without evidence of luminal GI bleeding or intraabdominal 
bleeding. He has evidence of hemolysis with high reticulocyte 
count, elevated LDH and indirect bilirubin, low haptoglobin, and 
positive Coombs test. No evidence of cirrhosis/hypersplenism on 
RUQ ultrasound. Normal coags rule out DIC, and smear showed no 
schistocytes to suggest microangiopathy. Hematolology consulted, 
presentation most concern for warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia. 
Patient started on Prednisone for treatment initially at 
90mg/day. C3/C4 nl (though C3 borderline low), RF neg, CRP 
elevated 19.8, HIV negative, Hepatitis serologies negative, B12 
WNL, dsDNA negative, G6PD elevated above assay. Hb has remained 
stable after initiation of prednisone, with subsequent 
downtitration from 90mg qd to 70mg qd on ___. While on high 
dose steroids, patient should remain on Bactrim DS 1 TAB PO TIW, 
calcium/vitamin supplements. He should continue to have once or 
twice weekly CBCs/LDH/Tbili/Hapto per hematology, who will 
follow closely as an outpatient.

#ETOH abuse and withdrawal: Presented ___ to detox, after 
last drink ___. Drinking heavily for ___ years, currently up to 2 
pints of vodka per day. Unable to control symptoms of withdrawal 
with diazepam, so received phenobarbital with rescue dose on 
___. Patient was intermittently agitated for much of his 
admission (less likely from EtOH withdrawal), likely in the 
setting of high dose steroids. He was treated with 500mg IV 
thiamine x3 days (___) with subsequent transition to PO 
thiamine 100mg daily. Phenobarbital taper finished on ___ and 
patient was discharged to home. He was also started on folate 
and a multivitamin. SW was consulted for substance abuse, and 
while we were unable to get him into his detox location of 
choice, he is getting reconnected with his home outpatient 
services. 

# Steroid-induced agitation: Patient demonstrated intermittent 
agitation ISO high dose steroids which was unlikley related to 
withdrawal (as discussed above). He was started on Haldol 0.5 mg 
PO TID and Benadryl 50 mg PO QHS with improved management of his 
agitation. 

# Chronic Diverticulitis: Patient presented with fevers, and has 
a history of diverticulitis. Abdominal CT was notable for 
sigmoid diverticulitis and he was started on IV abx on 
admission. Abd imaging was also notable for possible fistula 
with the distal ileum and reactive changes in the adjacent 
superior urinary bladder wall - given the  presence of air in 
the urinary bladder, a colovesicular fistula could not be fully 
excluded, but he did not have any evidence clinically of urinary 
or fecal complications suggesting a fistula. Patient was 
otherwise without active abdominal pain. General Surgery 
evaluated, and recommended no emergent need for surgery, but 
said he will need outpatient surgery followup for repeat imaging 
and possible elective sigmoidectomy. He will finish a 7 day 
course of Cipro/Flagyl the day after discharge (last day ___. 


# TRANSAMINITIS: AST>>ALT, fitting an alcoholic pattern. INR & 
platelets were normal. RUQUS demonstrated a normal appearing 
liver. Hep serologies were negative. Likely due to EtOH 
hepatitis, DF on admission 2. Remained persistently elevated 
during admission. Discussed importance of abstinence from EtOH. 
Should consider further outpatient hepatology workup.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted with alcohol withdrawal and anemia. You were 
treated with a medication called phenobarbital and your symptoms 
improved. We did test for your anemia which showed you have a 
condition called autoimmune hemolytic anemia (your immune cells 
are attacking and destroying your own red blood cells) and we 
treated you with steroids and your red blood cell levels 
improved. You were also found to have diverticulitis and you 
were treated with antibiotics. Because you were on high dose 
steroids, you were very agitated, we started medications to help 
relieve your agitation. 

You will be discharged to home. Please work with your father and 
visiting nurse service to take your medications as instructed. 
Please follow up with your health care providers with the below 
appointments.

TEE/cardioversion
 
History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo with PMH significant for HTN, 
presenting with a week long history of shortness of breath and 
dyspnea on exertion.  On presentation, she denied any chest 
pain, back pain, N/V, abdominal pain, HA, dizziness or 
peripheral edema. She has baseline DOE over the past few years 
and has been limiting her activity because of this.  She had 
been stable over the last few months but a few days ago noted 
increasing DOE.  She is having trouble walking any distance at 
all.  She has been using more of her Albuterol inhaler because 
of this.  She denies any new cough, URI symptoms or 
palpitations.  Other than feeling breathless, she has no other 
symptoms.
 
In the ED, initial vitals were  T 97.2 P ___ BP 123/65 RR 22 
SaO2 93% on RA. While in the ED, around 12:30pm the patient was 
tachycardic to 160.  Her EKG showed atrial fibrillation with 
RVR.  Her blood pressure at that time was stable with SBP of 
102/80 and O2 sats in high ___.  Patient was given 15mg IV 
Diltiazem with improvement in tachycardia to 90.  Her heart rate 
then increased back to about ~150 as the drug washed out.  She 
was given diltiazem 30mg PO.  She was offered outpatient 
management but chose admission.  

On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, 
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, hemoptysis, 
black stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or 
rigors. She has a chronic non-productive cough. She denies 
N/V/D, dysuria. All of the other review of systems were 
negative.  
 
Cardiac review of systems is notable for SOB and DOE as above, 
as well as paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and orthopnea. She 
denies chest pain, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or 
presyncope.

___ CHEST X-RAY
FINDINGS:  This examination is underpenetrated, accentuating 
density of the parenchyma. Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Low 
lung volumes accentuate heart size and pulmonary vasculature 
howevere there is no overt fluid overload. Lungs are clear.  
There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
  
IMPRESSION:  No cardiopulmonary abnormality on this 
underpenetrated study. 

___ TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal 
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall 
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally 
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an anterior 
space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. 

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular 
cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic 
function. No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.

___ TRANSESOPHAGEAL ECHOCARDIOGRAM
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of 
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right 
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen 
by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in 
the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are 
mildly thickened. There are filamentous strands on the aortic 
leaflets consistent with Lambl's excresences (normal variant). 
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: No intracardiac thrombus. Mild ___ regurgitation. 

  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo female presenting with dyspnea on exertion found with new 
onset symptomatic Afib with RVR and signs of volume overload.

# New onset Afib w/RVR: Pt presenting with shortness of breath 
and dyspnea on exertion which has acutely worsened over the week 
prior to admission. Pt thought to be in Afib for >48 hours upon 
presentation, outside of the window for cardioversion without 
TEE. Pt describes months of episodic dyspnea on exertion, 
self-treated as asthma with albuterol inhaler, but were perhaps 
possibly ___ paroxysms of Afib. Rate was not controlled on max 
dose diltiazem 15 mg/hr and metoprolol 400mg daily. She was 
bridged with heparin to a therapeutic INR on warfarin and 
underwent TEE/cardioversion with successful converstion to sinus 
rhythm. However, after cardioversion, pt developed >4.5 sec 
sinus pauses and bradycardia to ___. For this reason, she was 
not discharged on a beta blocker. She was set up to have an 
event monitor, with a plan to start low dose metoprolol 
succinate if she no longer has sinus pauses. INR was 3.6 on day 
of discharge; pt was prescribed warfarin 1mg, with instructions 
to hold the warfarin until INR check at ___ 
___ clinic on the day after discharge. 

# sinus pauses: occurred overnight after cardioversion, >4.5 
sec, asymptomatic. Unclear if these pauses occurred while 
patient was lying supine; she was not wearing CPAP at the time. 
Differential includes OSA vs. excessive nodal blockade vs. sick 
sinus syndrome. Pt has a history of non-compliance with CPAP and 
was counseled on the importance of CPAP for preventing sinus 
pauses and ectopy that could re-initiate her atrial 
fibrillation. Betablockade was held as above. Pt observed for 24 
hours while compliant with CPAP and did not have significant 
sinus pauses. She was arranged to have event monitor for ___ 
weeks, and to follow up with Dr. ___ in one month to monitor 
for further sinus pauses while off the beta blocker.

# orthopnea: CXR with vascular congestion. Pt likely with flash 
pulmonary edema ___ tachyarrythmia. Echo showed preserved 
systolic function, suboptimal images, could not comment on PA 
pressure. Given hives to HCTZ, a sulfa-moeity, initially avoided 
lasix in favor of ethacrynic acid, however net even with this 
agent. Ultimately diuresed with lasix IV without skin reaction, 
and orthopnea resolved. Pt still with baseline dyspnea on 
exertion. 

# Leukocytosis: Pt afebrile without focal infection signs. 
Leukocytosis persisted for 3 days; UA positive however culture 
grew mixed flora suggesting fecal contaminant. Leukocytosis 
resolved after removal of foley and 3 day course of ceftriaxone. 


# HTN: Home atenolol and amlodipine held while titrating nodal 
agents. Pt discharged on home dose of amlodipine but held beta 
blockade as above.

# OSA: Patient intermittently uses CPAP at home. Encouraged use 
and educated on importance of CPAP. Pt observed to be compliant 
towards the end of the admission.

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 
Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure to take care of you during your stay at ___. 
You came in with shortness of breath and were found to have an 
abnormal fast heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation. We were 
unable to slow down your heart rate with medicines, so we 
scheduled you for an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) 
which showed no clot, and then shocked the heart. This 
successfully converted your heart back to normal rhythm. 

You had a little extra fluid on your body from your heart not 
pumping efficiently while it was in Afib. We diuresed you with 
lasix and will be sending you home a small dose of lasix 20mg to 
take daily at home.

After the conversion, you had some very long pauses of your 
heart beat. Because of this we want you to wear a heart rhythm 
monitor for ___ weeks at home, to make sure you are not having 
more pauses, and also monitor if you go back into Afib. ___ 
___ will be in touch with you about this heart monitor, 
which you will receive at home in the mail within 3 business 
days.

We discussed the importance of wearing your CPAP to prevent 
converting back to Afib, and also to prevent the pauses we 
observed. Talk to your PCP about getting reconnected to a sleep 
center to keep your CPAP machine maintained and make sure you 
have the best-fitting mask.

When people are in atrial fibrillation, they are at risk of 
developing clots in the heart, which can break off and cause a 
stroke. To prevent this risk, you will need to take a blood 
thinner called warfarin, in case you go back into atrial 
fibrillation.  You will have to get your INR (a measure of how 
thin your blood is) checked regularly with the ___ 
clinic at ___ to make sure you are on the right 
dose of warfarin. You should get your INR checked tomorrow, 
___.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted for shortness of breath, most likely due fluid 
retention. This is most likely due to the blood received at your 
last hospitalization and your kidney injury. We were able to 
increase your water pills to give you more relief.

more than 3 lbs. Your weight on discharge was 61.4 kg (135.4 kg)

In addition, your blood pressure was a little bit high. At your 
last hospitalization at ___, they had discontinued 
lisinopril because you had some additional kidney injury (which 
was mostly likely due to low blood counts). Here, it appears 
that your kidney function has returned to your baseline 
(creatinine 2.0), so we feel comfortable restarting your 
lisinopril.

During your hospitalization, we received records from ___ 
that indicate that you have a H. pylori infection in your 
stomach. We started you on ""triple therapy"" which you should 
continue to take for a 14 day course.

Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum 
Recommendations: No evidence of recent or active bleeding on 
this examination. 
Due to suboptimal bowel preparation, this examination is not 
adequate for screening.
 
Additional notes: The procedure was performed by the fellow and 
the attending. The attending was present for the entire 
procedure and collaborated wtih the fellow on the findings of 
this report. The patient's reconciled home medication list is 
appended to this report. FINAL DIAGNOSES are listed in the 
impression section above. Estimated blood loss = zero. No 
specimens were taken for pathology 

ENDOSCOPY: Impression: Normal mucosa in the esophagus
The mucosa appeared pale and atrophied. In the fundus, the 
mucosa appeared somewhat patchy which could be consistent with 
atrophic gastritis. (biopsy)
Mucosa appeared normal but there were some dark areas of 
pigmentation likely related to iron supplementation. (biopsy)
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum 
Recommendations: Follow up biopsy results. 
Proceed with colonoscopy. 
Additional notes: The procedure was performed by the attending 
and the GI fellow. The attending was personally present during 
the entire procedure and collaborated with the Fellow on the

IMAGING:
========
___ KNEE W/O CONTRAST RI
1. Large knee joint effusion with associated synovitis.  No 
specific features for gout, however this could be further 
evaluated with arthrocentesis which I understand has been 
performed.
2. Degenerative changes as detailed above.  Tiny area of signal 
abnormality
along the posterior horn of the medial meniscus equivocal for 
small tear.  No large tear or ligamentous injury.
3. Cortical tunneling in the distal femur reflecting 
demineralization without aggressive infiltrative process 
identified.  This accounts for the
radiographic appearance.
   
___ (2 VIEWS) RIGHT
Moderate right knee joint effusion or synovitis.
There is mild degenerative arthritis of the right knee.
Diffuse small lucencies throughout visualized bones, with 
periarticular
spurring, consider disuse osteopenia, reflex sympathetic 
dystrophy or marrow infiltrative/neoplastic process if 
clinically appropriate.
   
___
The left atrial volume index is severely increased. No atrial 
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated 
right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Doppler parameters 
are most consistent with Grade II (moderate) left ventricular 
diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free 
wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, 
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and 
no aortic stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to 
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be 
significantly UNDERestimated.] There is moderate pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a 
prominent fat pad. 
   
___ (PORTABLE AP)
No significant interval change since the prior radiograph.
   
___ (PORTABLE AP)
Persistent moderate cardiomegaly and lung hyperinflation.  No 
focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
  
___ U.S.
No hydronephrosis.  Atrophic kidneys demonstrating cortical 
thinning
consistent with chronic parenchymal disease.  Simple bilateral 
renal cysts are incidentally noted.
  
___ (PA & LAT)
1.  Persistent moderate cardiomegaly and lung hyperinflation.  
No focal
consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
 
2.  The extent of pulmonary vascular congestion could be 
chronic, as it is
unchanged.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is an ___ y/o woman with a past medical history of 
chronic kidney injury (stage V), chronic anemia (EPO-dependent), 
CAD, HFpEF, HTN, and T2DM, who presented with shortness of 
breath, chest discomfort, and dizziness with blood pressures 
>200/90. 

# HFpEF exacerbation | Hypertensive Urgency | Volume Overload:
Initial concern for pneumonia, given possible retrocardiac 
opacity on plain film; however, final read of CXR negative for 
new infiltrate. Influenza negative. Cough with subjective fevers 
at home without leukocytosis. Exam and work-up suggestive of 
volume overload in the setting of diastolic HF and end-stage 
renal disease. TTE showed severe diastolic dysfunction, but no 
significant change from prior. She had minimal troponinemia 
without ischemic EKG changes attributed by cardiology to demand 
and poor renal clearance. Patient was initially started on IV 
hydralazine and nitroglycerin drip and continued on her home 
blood pressure medications (isosorbide 
mononitrate/carvedilol/doxazosin) for blood pressure lowering 
and aggressive diuresis with IV furosemide (80-120mg). She 
diuresed well, with improvement in her shortness of breath and 
lower extremity edema. Renal was consulted and recommended slow 
blood pressure lowering with permissive hypertension and target 
SBP 160s in the first few days with avoidance of DBP lowering 
below the ___. She was subsequently weaned off the nitroglycerin 
drip and the hydralazine and started on amlodipine 5mg daily, 
with improved blood pressure control. Dizziness, which was not 
accompanied by focal neurologic deficits, resolved with improved 
antihypertensive control. At discharge, her blood pressure was 
120-150s/50-60s. She also was started on torsemide 20mg PO daily 
for maintenance diuresis.

# Right Knee Gout: 
Patient developed right knee swelling on ___ in the setting of 
aggressive diuresis. The knee joint was aspirated and sent for 
gram stain, culture, cell counts, and crystal analysis. Crystal 
analysis was consistent with negatively birefringent MSU 
crystals. After a negative gram stain and 36h with negative 
cultures, the knee joint was injected with 40mg of 
methylprednisolone, given limited treatment options otherwise 
(NSAIDs, colchicine suboptimal due to ESRD, systemic prednisone 
suboptimal due to hypertension and fluid overload). Knee X-ray 
showed enlarged joint space and diffuse small lucencies 
throughout visualized bones, with periarticular spurring. MRI 
was obtained and showed changes consistent with osteopenia with 
no concern for malignancy.

# Acute-on-chronic normocytic anemia:
Likely in the setting of ESRD. No evidence of hemolytic anemia. 
Guaiac negative x3. Received 2U of pRBCs for nadir Hgb of 6.6 
for Hgb threshold of 9 per nephrology, with appropriate 
improvement in Hgb. Continued ferrous sulfate 325 mg daily.

# Thrombocytopenia: Platelet count nadired in the 130s, likely 
due to physiologic stress and brief antibiotic treatment on 
admission, normalized prior to discharge without dedicated 
intervention.

# Acute-on-chronic kidney injury (stage V):
Mild elevation of BUN/Cr compared to baseline. At baseline, she 
has declined HD in the past. Most likely cardiorenal in 
etiology, given severe diastolic dysfunction and fluid overload 
on exam in the setting of severe hypertension. FeUrea consistent 
with intrinsic renal disease, which is expected given her stage 
V chronic kidney injury. Nephrology consulted, and patient did 
not need urgent dialysis. Cr remained 4.3 at discharge, likely 
her new baseline in the setting of diuresis.

# Strep bovis bacteriuria: She was found to have asymptomatic 
Strep bovis bacteriuria without pyuria. Antibiotic treatment was 
deferred due to absence of symptoms and lack of clear true UTI. 

CHRONIC ISSUES
# CAD
- continued aspirin 81 mg daily
- continued pravastatin 20 mg qPM
- continued isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg daily

# T2DM
- Humalog insulin sliding scale and glargine 10 units qhs
- held glipizide and sitagliptin

# GERD
- continued pantoprazole 40 mg q24h

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
# Patient was started on amlodipine 5mg PO daily and home 
Isosorbide Mononitrate (Extended Release) was increased from 60 
mg to 90 mg daily, with good BP response. Target diastolic BPs 
given CAD and ESRD is >50.
# Patient was started on torsemide 20mg PO daily. ___ require 
uptitration when patient back to regular PO intake at home. 
Please monitor volume status and adjust dose of diuretics as 
needed.
# Simple bilateral renal cysts were incidentally noted on renal 
ultrasound.
# Patient diagnosed with first episode of gout, may require 
urate lowering agent if she develops another episode.
# F/U SPEP/UPEP which was still pending at time of discharge.
# Suggest further evaluation of chronic anemia; note that 
colonoscopy in ___ was inadequate for screening, and she could 
benefit from another colonoscopy if amenable, especially in 
light of Strep bovis bacteriuria, potentially fecal contaminant, 
but clinical significance of which is uncertain.
# Patient was noted to have an elevated protein to creatinine 
ratio of 8.2, please follow up on this issue and consider 
further management per primary nephrologist.
# She does not carry a diagnosis of COPD, but was found to have 
hyperinflation on CXR; could benefit from PFTs as an outpatient.
# New creatinine baseline 4.3.
# Dry weight: 55.3 Kg
# She was given lab script at discharge for reevaluation of CBC 
and chemistries/renal function.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you. You were admitted to the 
___ because you were short of 
breath and your blood pressure was very elevated. This was 
thought to be related to a large amount of fluid that your body 
had accumulated because of your heart failure and your kidney 
problems. We gave you the same medication in your water pills at 
home, but in intravenous form, which helped improve your 
breathing and lower your blood pressure. We also made changes to 
your home blood pressure medication regimen to ensure that your 
blood pressure remains under control.

While you were in the hospital, you developed right knee pain 
and swelling. We took a small sample of the fluid in your knee 
and analyzed it and found out that you had condition known as 
gout. Gout is due to crystals accumulating in your joints. You 
were treated with a steroid injection in the knee with good 
results. 

Wishing you a speedy recovery,
Your ___ Care Team

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with T2N2bM0 SCC of the tonsil 
who was admitted with currently admitted with neutropenic fever 
approximately 2 weeks after receiving ___ with 
concurrent chemotherapy.
.
#Neutropenic fever: ANC 710 on admission and febrile to 101.5. 
Given mucositis, Mr. ___ was started on Vancomycin and 
Cefepime. Blood cultures from ___ were read out as no growth. 
UA/CXR were unremarkable, and no abscess was observed on CT of 
the neck. Mr. ___ was maintained on neutropenic precautions 
until ___ when Mr. ___ ___ rose above 1000 following 
one dose of Neupogen (300mcg SC). Antibiotics were stopped on 
___ after Mr. ___ was afebrile x 3 days and cultures 
were found to be negative.
.
#T2N2bM0 SCC of tonsil: Mr. ___ was continued on XRT while 
in house. He also experienced considerable pain secondary to 
mucositis. This was accomplished by maintaining his 100 mcg/hr 
fentanyl patch, adding on a morphine ___, and treating 
topically with viscous lidocaine. Eventually, Mr. ___ 
___ was titrated to manage his pain and this regimen 
corresponded to a basal rate of 3mg/hr with a bolus rate of 3mg 
(6 min delay) and a total hour lockout of 12mg. With the 
assistance of palliative care, the  ___ was weaned and the 
basal rate was then transitioned to an additional 75mcg/hr of 
transdermal fentanyl. The bolus morphine was converted to 
enteral morphine ___ mg every 2 hours as needed. A bowel 
regimen with liquid colace and lactulose.
.
#Thrush: Mr. ___ was noted on ___ to have oral thrush on 
exam. He was begun on Fluconazole 200mg daily for 3 days with 
complete eradication of thrush.
.
#FEN: Mr. ___ expressed a dyspepsia with 60cc/hr bolused 
tube feeds. He was transitioned to 45 cc/hr tube feeds with 
nutrition's guidance. He was maintained on the Boost formula. 
Mr. ___ dyspepsia also improved with twice daily 
ranitidine.

Transitional Issues:

oncology service, he was followed by psychiatry, with initiation 
of mirtazepine. He was monitored by a 1:1 sitter and denied 
active suicidal or homicidal ideation throughout his stay on the 
oncology service.

(2)PEG/nutrition: He was admitted to the oncology service due to 
concern for PEG malfunction, though bedside PEG study ultimately 
revealed patent/well positioned PEG, precluding need for 
replacement. Following video swallow study demonstrating 
tolerance of soft solids and thin liquids, he was trialed on PO 
only diet with daily calorie counts. Unfortunately, they were 
able only able to use his I&Os, as his PO intake was not 
recorded. Patient stating that he has been trying to eat more. 
In the event that he requires tube feeds to maintain adequate 
caloric intake, Jevity 1.2 at 70 mL/h (or Jevity 1.2 at 105 mL/h

regimen) is advised by nutrition.

(3)Substance abuse: On admission, he endorsed daily cocaine use 
for the preceding 2 months, last ___, with toxicology screen 
positive for cocaine and opiates. There were no signs of 
intoxication or withdrawal throughout his stay on the oncology 
service.

(4)Squamous cell carcinoma of the left tonsil s/p cisplatin/XRT 
concluding in ___: He has residual chronic pain and 
dysphagia, and pain remained well controlled on home Fentanyl 
patch with morphine for breakthrough throughout his stay on the

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___. You came in because you were feeling depressed and had 
thoughts of harming yourself. Psychiatry evaluated you and 
believe you will benefit from inpatient psychiatric care. We 
also started on you on a new medication, mirtazapine, which may 
help with depression as well as increase your appetite.

Studies of your G-tube showed that it is patent and well 
positioned. We decided to hold off on tube feeds during 
hospitalization to see if you can take enough nutrition through 
eating. We are glad to see your taste buds are coming back, and 
encourage you to keep eating. If you are unable to maintain your 
weight, you will need to re-start tube feeds.  

We wish you all the best in your recovery.

PSYCHIATRIC

#) SIMD/PSA
Patient presented with depression and SI but reported that these 
thoughts went away when he was admitted. During his admission to 
the medicine service, he was placed on 7.5mg mirtazapine which 
helped mitigate his symptoms of hopelessness and may have 
improved his appetite as well. During his stay on Deac 4, we 
increased the dose to 15mg QHS which helped the pt to achieve 
good sleep nightly, and he also ate meals routinely with a very 
good appetite.

Patient expressed significant anxiety about being discharged to 
a shelter, as he was certain that he would quickly relapse on 
drugs if he was not in a controlled hospital setting. He also 
expresses anxiety at currently being homeless,as his long time 
girlfriend has kicked him out of her home given his 
polysubstance abuse. 

Despite reports of anxiety, Mr. ___ remained safe during his 
hospital stay and consistently engaged animatedly with peers in 
the milieu.  He denied si except he would tell us repeatedly 
that if we did not find a ""long-term"" rehab placement for him 
and d/c'd him to a shelter, he would plan to relapse on drugs 
and then would likely become suicidal again.  Mr. ___ was 
encouraged to work toward sobriety and engage in his recovery 
while on our hospital unit.  Although he attended a couple of 
unit groups and AA meetings early in his admission, he refused 
to engage further in recovery work, and he repeatedly told us 
that he was waiting for ""rehab placement"" to begin such work.  
We advised the patient using drugs/etoh upon d/c would be his 
choice, and we strongly recommended that he avoid use of illicit 
drugs and etoh.  

Patient was difficult to find long-term placement for in a 
substance rehab program or medical respite due to his medical 
complexities. Patient was told that if he were able to take less 
PRN morphine or transition to methadone, that perhaps placement 
would be easier. The patient reported that he needed to continue 
his morphine at home doses and that he adamantly refused to make 
changes to his pain regimen.  

We discussed his pain medication regimen with Dr. ___, 
___ oncologist/prescriber. She voiced some concern over 
increasing the fentanyl patch (in order to decrease frequency of 
breakthrough morphine ___ and would prefer to have pain consult 
help us convert him to methadone, which she has raised 
previously to the patient, but he has been resistant.  The team 
reiterated this recommendation daily with the patient, who 
consistenly refused such an option and was adamant that he will 
not consider different meds.  We also discussed with the patient 
his long h/o drug abuse and suggested that he has a dependency 
on fentanyl and morphine.  Mr. ___ had no insight into this 
and refused to discuss further with the team.  He would become 
upset and end our meetings when we attempted to direct our 
meetings toward discussions about his drug abuse and options for 
recovery. 

#) SECONDARY GAIN
Mr. ___ underwent a lengthy inpatient psychiatric admission 
as the team attempted to work with him to improve his prognosis. 
 We shared the diagnostic impression that despite his cancer and 
chronic pain (which could both perpetuate depression), his drug 
abuse appears to largely drive his mood d/o and current 
psychosocial stressors including homelessness. 

The team repeatedly encouraged Mr. ___ to work toward his 
recovery during his long hospitalization here on Deac 4 by 
attending groups and working with the team via insight-oriented 
meetings.  Mr. ___ consistently became upset and ended our 
meetings when attempted to engage him in talk about recovery, 
and he refused to consider alternatives to Q2h morphine/fentanyl 
patches.  He also repeatedly told us that if we d/c'd him to a 
shelter he would abuse illicit drugs and then likely become 
suicidal.  
Despite the above, he never self-harmed on the unit and was 
highly animated with peers.  After pursuing placements for him 
in rehab facilities, all of which rejected him due to dependency 
on morphine/fentanyl patch and unwillingness to transition to 
methadone, it appeared likely that Mr. ___ was making 
threats of relapse/suicide to gain shelter on Deac 4.  

On the day of discharge, the patient denied SI/HI, depression, 
or any other acute problems.  He did state that he does not like 
sheltered living, and had no intentions of going to the ___ Medical Stay-Inn Bed which we had arranged for him.  
The patient asked the team to allow him to stay in his hospital 
bed until he could arrange a stable residence.  The pt was 
advised that hospitalization was no longer necessary and that we 
recommend he utilize the sheltered housing which had been 
arranged for him.  
  

GENERAL MEDICAL CONDITIONS
#) CANCER
Patient has history of SCC of left tonsil on chronic PEG. While 
patient was admitted he was followed by nutrition including 
daily calorie counts. They deemed his oral intake to be 
sufficient and patient did not need to use his PEG tube at all 
since his arrival. We notified his oncologist Dr. ___ 
improved po intake and that the GI tube may be able to be 
removed in the near future. Patient continued to take morphine 
at his home dose for his cancer pain. 

#) HYPOTHYROIDISM
He continued levothyroxine at his home dose. 

#) TOOTH PAIN
During admission, patient experienced some tooth pain that 
resolved with tylenol.  He had no fevers or signs of infection.

PSYCHOSOCIAL
#) GROUPS/MILIEU
The pt was highly animated and engaing with the peers on the 
unit.  He never engaged in any unsafe behaviors, and he was 
often found on the telephone talking with friends/family.  He 
did occasionally attend groups including AA at the beginning of 
his hospital stay, but he then declined most groups during the 
last couple of weeks of admission.  The pt ate all meals in the 
milieu, slept well, and cooperated with unit rules.  

#) COLLATERAL
The pt allowed us to speak with his GF, with whom he was 
previously living.  She reported that due to his relapse on 
drugs and lack of motivation for change, he could not return 
home.  She understood that he was recently suicidal and agreed 
that using illicit drugs is the precipitant for him not doing 
well.

#) PLACEMENT
At the pt's request for ___ rehab, the team attempted to 
have the pt d/c'd to subst abuse residential programs, sober 
living residences, or nursing home placement.  All programs, 
which are listed below, have declined Mr. ___ due to his 
cont'd use of narcotics and unwillingness to consider transition 
to methadone.

LEGAL
Patient signed CV and remained on such during his hospital stay.

RISK ASSESSMENT
This patient is currently sober, not suicidal/homicidal, is 
feeling well and is highly animated and euthymic in the milieu, 
all of which indicate a low immediate risk of harm. 
He does, however, have a very high risk of relapse on illicit 
drugs which gives him an overall poor prognosis and a high 
chance of future suicidal thoughts/self-harm.

Static risk factors include:
White male with a h/o suicidal thoughts in the context of 
illicit drug use.

Modifiable risk includes:
Chronic pain (which is well-controlled per the patient on 
Morphine and Fentanyl), recent SIMD (which was treated by a 
lengthy inpatient psychiatric admission where the pt 
successfully started Remeron and experienced a great improvement 
in mood), and homelessness (which was addressed by arranging a 
placement at the ___ Medical Stay-In Bed).  Mr. 
___ chronic illicit drug use and stated intention to use 
again if d/c'd to a shelter do increase his risk.  We attempted 
to modify this by pursuing placement in a rehab/snf/sober house 
(all of which advised that they would consider the patient if he 
would take methadone in lieu of fentanyl patch/morphine - a 
recommendatino which he rejected).  We also attempted to modify 
this risk by providing a great deal of psychoeducation about 
drugs use and its potential to worsen mood and lead to SI.  Mr. 
___ was given the opportunity on Deac 4 to work on his 
recovery by attending a multitude of groups and meetings about 
substance abuse, most of which he rejected.  
Mr. ___ is considered competent to make his own decisions 
(including those described above), and we advised him upon d/c 
he is likewise competent to accept our referrals and maintain 
sobriety or to reject them.  He was advised that failure to 
comply with recommendations could lead to him suffering 
irreversible damage (i.e. suicide in the context of illicit drug 
use).  To further help Mr. ___, we referred him to a 
substance abuse partial program, and have provided aftercare 
psychiatric treaters.

The patient is protected by the following factors:
He now has about 3 weeks of sobriety from illicits and has many 
outpatient referrals for further care.  He does have a GF who 
appears to be supportive and encouraging him to work toward 
sobriety.  Mr. ___ also is connected to his oncologist, with 
whom he appears to have a good relationship and is motivated to 
continue seeing in follow-up.

PROGNOSIS
Poor due to the fact that this patient is at high risk for 
relapse on drugs, has stated that he will likely use again, and 
is precontemplative in terms of the change process.

IMAGING: 
========

___ EEG:
This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring study due to 
the presence of numerous brief electrographic seizures  

___ CXR:
Endotracheal tube terminating 4.4 cm above the level of the
carina.  Tubing is seen coiled over the neck, which may 
represent
oropharyngeal coiling of an orogastric tube.  No acute
intrathoracic process.

___ CTA Head/Neck:
1.  Dental amalgam streak artifact limits study. 
2. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, large
territorial infarct. Please note MRI of the brain is more
sensitive for the detection of acute infarct. 
3.  Patent circle of ___ without definite evidence of
stenosis,occlusion,or aneurysm. 
4. Nonocclusive probable atherosclerotic narrowing of left
vertebral artery origin narrowing. 
5. Otherwise, patent bilateral cervical carotid and vertebral
arteries without definite evidence of stenosis, occlusion, or
dissection. 
6. No evidence of dural venous sinus thrombosis. 
7. Nonspecific patchy consolidations in bilateral lung fields. 
If clinically indicated, consider dedicated chest imaging for
further evaluation. 8. 14 x 6 mm collection of air in the right
paratracheal region, which may be iatrogenic.  Attention on
follow-up on chest x-ray. 
9. The nasogastric tube appears to descent towards the right. 
Consider checking location of the nasogastric tube.

___ EEG:
presence of numerous brief right frontotemporal electrographic 
seizures 

___ MRI Head:
1. No acute intracranial contents. Parenchymal atrophy. 
2. Symmetric mucosal enhancement, stranding oropharynx, may be
reactive, inflammatory, or other etiology, incompletely
visualized. 
3. Abnormal left globe, see above.

___ CXR:
No prior chest imaging available. 
ET tube is in standard placement.  Nasogastric drainage tube 
ends
in the upper portion of a nondistended stomach.  
Left lung and hemithorax are substantially smaller than the
right, but I do not see discrete atelectasis or evidence of 
prior
surgery.  No focal abnormality is seen in either lung.  Pleural
effusion is small on the left if any.  Cardiomediastinal and
hilar contours are normal. 
Although no acute or other chest wall lesion is seen,
conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection
or characterization of most such abnormalities. If the
demonstration of trauma or other soft tissue abnormality 
involving the chest wall is clinically warranted, the location 
of
any referable focal findings  should be clearly marked and 
imaged
with either bone detail radiographs or Chest CT scanning.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with developemental delay (non 
verbal at baseline) with possible seizure disorder whom 
presented with generalized tonic clonic seizures and was found 
to be in NCSE whose course was complicated by slow weaning from 
the ventilator requiring tracheostomy and PEG tube placement who 
has not yet returned to baseline and is now comfort measures 
only.  

#Nonconvulsive Status Epilepticus
He presented after possible GTC. cvEEG initially showed multiple 
non-convulsive events, followed by a convulsive event and 
eventually progressed into NCSE. He was loaded and trialed on 
multiple AEDs without success and eventually required intubation 
with phenobarbital and midazolam and propofol gtts. After burst 
suppression was achieved he was eventually weaned down off of 
his AEDs and will be discharged on phenobarbital and ***(maybe 
lacosamide). Etiology unclear, but did not seem to be infectious 
(no sustained leukocytosis, no fevers, normal CSF, no 
consolidation on CXR, UCx final negative, BCx negative), no 
ischemia or inflammation MRI, paraneoplasic antibodies negative. 
His mental status has improved and he is no longer 
encephalopathic. He regards examiner and will wave hello. He is 
non-verbal at baseline.

#Respiratory distress with recurrent aspiration
Initially intubated for airway protection in setting of NCSE, 
but was unable to be weaned from the ventilator so tracheostomy 
and PEG was placed on ___. He has subsequently been weaned 
down to trach collar with humidified air. Patient repeatedly has 
aspiration events with desaturation and respiratory distress. 
There was concern for trachea-esophageal fistula due to TF 
coming out of tracheostomy. CT chest and EGD did not show any 
evidence of fistula. Continue humidified air, morphine and 
Ativan PRN for symptomatic management and comfort.

#Deep venous thrombosis: 
Patient with right sided DVT secondary to PICC-line leading to 
removal of the line.  He was treated with anticoagulation until 
he was made comfort measures only.

#Code status
Patient was made DNR/DNI on ___ due to persistent ventilator 
dependence. The patient's guardian and sister, ___, 
applied for expanded guardianship to make the patient CMO which 
was approved on ___. He is no longer ventilator dependent, 
but is dependent on artificial nutrition. Due to deconditioning, 
severity of brain disease, he is not at his baseline and it will 
be difficult to get him back to a quality of life is such that 
she believes he would enjoy. We are now focused on his comfort 
with feeding for pleasure, reduction in medications without 
prolongation of life through artificial feeding.

Transitional Issues:
-Continue comfort care of eating for pleasure, humidified air 
for tracheostomy, morphine, Ativan as needed for pain, 
respiratory distress, scopolamine, glycopyrolate for secretions
-Wean AEDs as appropriate. When patient becomes less alert, plan 
to transition to Ativan around the clock. 
-Minimize supplemental fluid intake. Will no longer provide 
artificial nutrition

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted because you were having a lot of seizures, 
which required a lot of medications stop them. Because these 
medications are sedating, you were intubated (a breathing tube 
was put down your throat) to help you breathe. It was difficult 
to wean you off the ventilator, so a tracheostomy and feeding 
tube were placed so that we could get the tube out of your 
mouth. Since then, you have been slowly recovering, but you are 
not back to your normal self. We will continue to provide you 
with care to keep you comfortable.

Thank you for involving us in your care.

Sincerely,

___ Neurology

Discharge Instructions:
Your band was removed, but that does not mean you have to 
abandon your efforts to improve your health.  Take this 
opportunity and incorporate what you have learned from your 
health care team.  Continue being active on a regular basis and 
follow these healthful guidelines (not diet!) for life long 
benefits.

In the hospital, you will be on a stage 3 diet for healing.  
This diet includes all liquid, high protein, low sugar and low 
fat supplements.  When you are discharged home, you may advance 
your diet as tolerated.  Below are some helpful tips to continue 


your journey of eating well and healthy living.

 

1.Keep an eye on calories.

2.Always eat at a table.  Avoid eating while driving, standing, 


sitting on the sofa, or lying in bed.  

3.Eat slowly.  Continue to take 30 minutes to eat a meal and 
chew your foods thoroughly. 

4.Surround yourself with healthy foods. Clean out your cabinets 


of any trigger or unsafe foods.

5.Keep a food journal or track your intake on-line.  Record 
what you eat, portion sizes, and the time you eat.  You may want 


to include your mood and hunger level, as well.

6.Avoid skipping meals.  Always eat at regular times to avoid 
overeating later in the day.

7.Listen to your body.  Eat when you are physically hungry and 
stop when you are full.

8.Be active.  Engage in at least ___ minutes of physical 
activity most (if not all) days of the week. 

9.Regularly check your weight.  Give yourself an acceptable 
range (i.e. 5 pounds).  This prevents slip ups from becoming 
bigger problems down the road.

10. Make small changes.  Set small, reasonable goals to keep on 


track. 

11. Reward yourself.  Treat yourself when you reach goals with 
a non-food treat (i.e. pedicure, movie). 

12. Ask for support. Call the ___ nutrition clinic for 
follow-up at ___. Join Weight Watchers, talk to friends 


and family or contact a local dietitian. 

13. Drink plenty of fluids. Stay hydrated.

Fluids & Diet
Fluid intake is extremely important the first month of your 
recovery. You must also take in enough liquids
to prevent dehydration. Dehydration can cause nausea, fatigue, 
lightheadedness and dark urine.  We recommend you track what you 


drink and eat each day. 
Most Frequent Problems

Discomfort
Abdominal soreness below your ribs on the left side is the most 
common site of tenderness after waking up. Despite this 
discomfort, it is very important that you get out of bed and 
take short walks.

Dehydration
Your most important job after surgery is drinking enough fluid. 
Dehydration is the most common reason to return to the hospital 
after surgery. Your goal is to drink 8 cups (64 oz) of fluid a 
day. You may not be able to drink this much fluid at first, but 
come as close as you can. Refer to your nutrition
packet for more details.

Wound Drainage & Infection
It is important to care for your incisions to prevent infection. 


You will have small fiber tapes on your wounds. This should keep 


your wound dry and closed. Leave them on until they fall off by 
themselves. Do not put band aids, ointments, lotions or powder 
on your incisions. You may get your incisions wet but
avoid scrubbing them. Pat them dry. It is not unusual for an 
incision to drain a little bloody fluid after you
go home. If you have some drainage, dab the wounds with diluted 
hydrogen peroxide (hydrogen
peroxide mixed half and half with water) and then cover with a 
dry gauze. Doing this twice a day will
speed your recovery.
Infections are uncommon and rarely serious after a laparoscopic 
operation. An infection will be red, warm,
firm, and tender. The infected fluid will look more like pus 
than like blood. If you notice this please call the
nurse at the Bariatric ___ Program to discuss your symptoms

Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Except for subsegmental 
atelectasis in the lingula, lungs are clear.  No pleural 
effusion or pneumothorax is present. Clips are seen in the right 
upper quadrant of the abdomen.  No acute osseous abnormalities 
are identified.
 
IMPRESSION:
No acute cardiopulmonary process.

STRESS ECHO ___
The patient exercised for 9 minutes and 0 seconds according to a 
Gervino treadmill protocol ___ METS) reaching a peak heart rate 
of 102 bpm and a peak blood pressure of 170/80 mmHg. The test 
was stopped because of fatigue. This level of exercise 
represents a poor exercise tolerance for age. The exercise ECG 
was uninterpretable due to resting ST-T wave changes (see 
exercise report for details). There is resting systolic 
hypertension. The blood pressure response to stress was blunted. 
There was a blunted heart rate response to stress [beta 
blockade].

Resting images were acquired at a heart rate of 56 bpm and a 
blood pressure of 162/90 mmHg. These demonstrated normal 
regional and global left ventricular systolic function. Right 
ventricular free wall motion is normal. There is no pericardial 
effusion. Doppler demonstrated mild mitral regurgitation with no 
aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation or significant resting 
LVOT gradient. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. Echo images were acquired within 43 seconds after 
peak stress at heart rates of 92 - 80 bpm. These demonstrated 
appropriate augmentation of all left ventricular segments. There 
was augmentation of right ventricular free wall motion.

IMPRESSION: Poor functional exercise capacity. Uninterpretable 
ECG changes in the absence of 2D echocardiographic evidence of 
inducible ischemia to achieved low workload. Mild mitral 
regurgitation at rest. 

___ STRESS
This ___ y.o. IDDM woman with h/o HTN was referred to 
the lab for evaluation of chest pain and dyspnea. The patient 
exercised 
for 9.0 minutes of a Gervino protocol (~ ___ METS), representing 
a poor 
exercise tolerance for her age. The test was stopped due to 
fatigue. 
At minute 7 of exercise, the patient noted ___ non-progressive 
left 
sided chest heaviness. This discomfort improved with deep 
inspiration 
and resolving quickly in recovery by minute 1.25. At peak 
exercise, 
there was non-specific T wave normalization was noted. The T 
waves 
returned to baseline in recovery. The rhythm was sinus with 
rare, 
isolated apbs, frequent, polymorphic vpbs, and several 
ventricular 
couplets throughout the study. Baseline systolic hypertension 
with an 
initial drop in systolic blood pressure during exercise. 
Appropriate increase in blood pressure response to exercise as 
it 
continued but the overall response was blunted. Blunted heart 
rate 
response to exercise in the presence of beta blocker therapy. 
  
IMPRESSION: Poor exercise capacity. Atypical anginal type 
symptoms with 
uninterpretable ECG changes to achieved low workload. Resting 
systolic hypertension with abnormal blood pressure and blunted 
heart 
rate response to exercise. Echo report sent separately. 

 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with DM, HTN, ___ edema presented to ED with Chest Pain. 
Chest pain was exertional in nature and raised concern for 
unstable angina. Initial troponins x2 in ED were negative. EKG 
with no acute ischemic changes. Chest pain may have been 
muscular in origin or associated with anxiety at the time, given 
patient's known history of panic attacks. Given patient's risk 
factors she underwent a stress test on ___ which showed 
nonspecific ECG changes in the absence of 2D echo evidence of 
inducible ischemia. ___ hospital course is summarized by 
problems below:

#Chest Pain: Patient presents with exertional chest pain that 
raised concern for unstable angina. Initial troponins x 2 
negative along with no EKG changes.Third troponin also returned 
negative. Stress was done on ___ which showed nonspecific 
ECG changes in the absence of 2D echo evidence of inducible 
ischemia.LVEF greater than 60%. Reached METS of 4.8 on stress. 
Patient was medically treated on aspirin 81. Home atenolol was 
discontinued and patient was started on losartan 25 daily during 
this hospitalization. PCP was notified prior to discharge and 
will monitor blood pressure on discharge. 

#HTN:SBP in th 130's. HTN was controlled with home dose of lasix 
and losaratan 25 daily. Atenolol was discontinued.

# DM: Hg A1C was 8.6 on ___. Patient's oral hypoglycemics 
were held during hospitalization. Blood sugars were controlled 
with ISS.

IMAGING:
=====================
Echocardiogram ___: Normal left ventricular wall thickness, 
cavity size, and regional/global systolic function (biplane LVEF 
= 71 %). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good 
leaflet excursion. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally 
normal. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is 
normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. 
IMPRESSION: Trivial physiologic pericardial effusion. Normal 
biventricular cavity sizes with preserved regional and global 
biventricular systolic function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the effusion is slightly smaller, though the exact same 
orientation was not obtained with this study and may therefore 
represent no change.  

Echocardiogram ___: Right ventricular chamber size and free 
wall motion are normal. There is a very small pericardial 
effusion anterior to the right ventricle (clip 5). No 
hemodynamic compromise is suggested. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female with hx CAD, HTN, DM2 (diet-controlled), HL, 
GERD who presented at ___ with chest pain, transferred to 
___ for cath, then transferred to CCU after perforated LCx 
during cath. The following issues were addressed during this 
hospitalization: 

# Perforated LCx: Cath complicated by LCx perforation during 
procedure. Perforation was sealed with a balloon. In CCU for 
monitoring. Possible complication is bleeding and possible 
cardiac tamponade. She was monitored closely but remained 
hemodynamically stable. A follow-up Echo was obtained (see 
results above), and she was discharged the day after admission.
 
# Unstable angina s/p cath: Patient presented with UA, trops 
negative, no EKG findings. Per cardiologist recommendations, she 
underwent cath.  Cath notable for Cx with mid vessel 70% lesion 
at the takeoff of a small OM which was subtotally occluded

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your stay at ___ 
___.

#Why did you come to the hospital?

- You were having chest pain that did not get better at ___ 
___. Your cardiologist, Dr. ___ you for a procedure 
to check your heart's blood vessels for blockages that might be 
the cause of your pain.

# What happened when you were at the hospital?

- You had a cardiac catheterization. During the procedure, a 
balloon opened a blockage in one of your heart's blood vessels 
that was probably causing your chest pain. During the procedure, 
one of your arteries was damaged, causing a leakage of blood 
outside of the artery. It was treated by putting pressure on it 
for a few minutes and giving you medicine to help your blood 
clot. You recovered very well from the procedure but stayed 
overnight in the hospital so we could watch you closely.

# What should I do when I leave the hospital?

You should:
- take all of your home medications as prescribed before you 
came to the hospital.
- see your cardiologist and primary care doctor at your 
scheduled appointments.

Best,
Your ___ Team

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You came to the hospital because your doctor was concerned about 
your chest pain and high blood pressures. Your blood pressures 
were improved while you were in the hospital. You underwent 
another heart catheterization which showed that the previous 
blockages in your heart had remained the same, and that there 
were no new blockages in your heart.  We watched you overnight 
after the procedure and you continued to do well without more 
chest pain.

We changed some of your home medications while you were in the 
hospital. Please take all of these medications as prescribed and 
make sure you follow up with your primary care doctor about the 
doses of these medications when you leave the hospital.

Please follow up with your cardiologist and Primary Care Doctor 
after you leave the hospital.

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___.

Sincerely,
Your ___ Medicine Team

IMAGING:
==========
___ CXR: IMPRESSION:  
  
No acute intrathoracic process. 

___ TTE:
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
normal cavity size and regional/
global biventricular systolic function. Small circumferential 
pericardial effusion without
echocardiographic evidence for tamponade physiology.

___ Coronary angiogram:
The coronary circulation is right dominant.
LM: The Left Main, arising from the left cusp, is a medium 
caliber vessel. This vessel bifurcates into
the Left Anterior Descending and Left Circumflex systems.
LAD: The Left Anterior Descending artery, which arises from the 
LM, is a medium caliber vessel.
There is a 30% stenosis in the proximal segment.
The Diagonal, arising from the proximal segment, is a medium 
caliber vessel. There is a 30% stenosis in
the proximal segment.
Cx: The Circumflex artery, which arises from the LM, is a large 
caliber vessel.
The ___ Obtuse Marginal, arising from the proximal segment, is a 
medium caliber vessel.
The ___ Obtuse Marginal, arising from the mid segment, is a very 
small caliber vessel. There is a 100%
stenosis in the ostium. Collaterals from the mid segment of the 
LAD connect to the mid segment.
The ___ Obtuse Marginal, arising from the mid segment, is a 
medium caliber vessel.
RCA: The Right Coronary Artery, arising from the right cusp, is 
a medium caliber vessel. There is a
30% in-stent restenosis in the ostium. There is a stent in the 
proximal, mid, and distal segments.
The Right Posterior Descending Artery, arising from the distal 
segment, is a medium caliber vessel.
The Right Posterolateral Artery, arising from the distal 
segment, is a medium caliber vessel.
Sedation
The procedure was not feasible without moderate sedation. Risks, 
benefits and alternatives were
discussed and informed consent obtained. With rhythm, blood 
pressure and oxygen saturation monitors,
constant nursing observation, and direct attending supervision, 
the patient received an appropriate level
of sedation (see medication list ). The attending was at the 
bedside continuously for 20 min during
sedation. The patient was subsequently observed with serial 
examinations until the return of pre-sedation
mental status.

Complications
There were no clinically significant complications.
Findings

 Branch vessel coronary artery disease.
 Mild disease. Known small OM occlusion is chronic and seen on 
prior angio.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
=====================
___ yo F with hx of CAD s/p cath ___ c/b LCx perforation, RCA 
CTO PCI in ___, presenting with bothersome chest discomfort & 
lightheadedness for past 2 months (both at rest and with 
exercise) reminiscent of her prior angina, sent in by her 
cardiologist in this context when she was found to have 
hypertensive urgency in clinic. Hypertension improved with nitro 
drip & was transitioned to PO antihypertensives, EKG & trops 
negative, negative pMIBI in ___. Due to symptomatic angina, 
she underwent coronary angiogram on ___ that showed branch 
vessel coronary artery disease and mild disease with known small 
OM chronic occlusion. No intervention was made. Her medications 
were optimized with hypertension regimen including isosorbide 
mononitrate XR 60 mg BID, carvedilol 37.5 mg BID, quinapril 40 
mg qAM, verapamil 120 mg qPM, doxazosin 6 mg qPM. She was 
monitored closely and discharged in stable condition.  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
==================
HTN: 
[] Consider renal artery ultrasound with doppler for 
consideration of revascularization if this HTN continues to be 
an issue
[] consider increasing quinapril to 60 mg daily for hypertensive 
control

[] Consider addition of acupuncture for coronary angina given 
patient on maximum anti-anginal therapy (pt with allergy to 
ranolazine)

[] Pt was placed on chlorthalidone for about 3 days in the 
setting of hypertensive urgency but developed hyponatremia. 
Would avoid this medication in future treatment. 
*** Please repeat BMP at post-discharge follow up to ensure Na 
normalizes***

OSH with a dose of hydralazine and subsequently with lower BPs 
on nitro gtt. History concerning for unstable angina given 
substernal chest pressure at rest associated with left sided 
chest throbbing/pressure that she states is similar to her last 
MI. Her EKG is unchanged from baseline and her troponins x2 are 
negative, which is reassuring. Exam otherwise not remarkable. 
Patient treated as though hypertensive emergency given chest 
pressure, although no evidence of end organ damage. She had a 
negative pMIBI at ___ in ___ when she was having 
similar sxs to now, although could have been falsely reassuring 
b/c of her collateral anatomy. The patient's hypertension was 
treated with nitro gtt and then transitioned an oral regimen 
that included isosorbide mononitrate XR 60 mg BID, carvedilol 
37.5 mg BID, quinapril 40 mg qAM, verapamil 120 mg qPM, 
doxazosin 6 mg qPM. On ___, she underwent coronary angiogram 
that showed showed branch vessel coronary artery disease and 
mild disease with known small OM chronic occlusion. No 
intervention was made. 

# Hyponatremia
Pt with new hyponatremia likely from chlorthalidone that was 
started this admission. Chlorthalidone was discontinued ___

IMAGING/STUDIES
===============
CTA CHEST ___
Limited by respiratory motion.  No evidence of pulmonary 
embolism to the 
segmental level or aortic abnormality. 

TTE ___
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal 
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be 
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is 
low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The right ventricular free wall is 
hypertrophied. with borderline normal free wall function. There 
is abnormal septal motion/position (there is an intermittent 
septal bounce that is nonspecific. Can be seen in constrictive 
pericarditis, but there is no other clear evidence for this 
including reduced e' velocities). The number of aortic valve 
leaflets cannot be determined. There is no aortic valve 
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is borderline pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which 
most likely represents a prominent fat pad. 
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Low normal global 
biventricular systolic function. Couldnt assess RV size well 
but may be mildly dilated. Borderline pulmonary hypertension. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___ 
global biventricular systolic function is less vigorous. 
Pulmonary pressures are lower but could be underestimated due to 
limited interrogation angles with poor image quality (patient 
could not roll over for the technologist).

and HFrEF (EF 40%) who presents from pulmonary clinic in setting 
of severe COPD, FEV1/FVC 32% (FEV1 21% predicted), new anemia of 
unclear etiology. She was treated with steroids and discharged 
on a steroid taper. There was concern initially for COPD 
exacerbation but further history revealed she was near her 
baseline respiratory function. Her respiratory function was 
concerning for her home safety and after ___ evaluation, the 
decision was made to discharge her to rehabilitation ___. 
During her hospitalization, she was found to have anemia 
(baseline Hgb from ___ of 12, down to 9 on admission and 
stable at 8). Given significant change from baseline, concern 
for active blood loss anemia. Stool guaiac x 3 negative, CT A/P 
without evidence of acute bleed/retroperitoneal bleed. Likely, 
anemia secondary to hemorrhoid bleeding per history but Hgb 
remained stable throughout remainder of hospitalization and was 
stable at 8.7 on discharge. 

# Acute on chronic anemia - Hemoglobin of 7.9 ___ (stably low 
on subsequent repeats ___ was concerning given 
history of severe hemorrhoids and also upper GI symptoms 
(epigastric pain and nausea)/history of acute pancreatitis 
(lipase normal).  This may all have been ___ hemorrhoidal 
bleeding, though initial rectal guaiac NEG.  Upper GI source 
considered (may be hidden somewhat ___ severe constipation), 
especially in setting of complaints of epigastric pain and 
ongoing steroid treatment for COPD.  No signs of RP bleed on 
physical exam, abdominal exam benign.  CT Abd/pelv ___ with NO 
sign of intraabdominal bleed.  Hemolysis labs unremarkable.  
Iron studies consistent with Fe deficiency (Fe 45, Ferritin 9.1, 
Fe sat ~8%), started PO supplemental iron.  Reticulocyte index 
<2% suggesting marrow suppression, furthermore WBC count quite 
low despite treatment with high dose steroids.  Patient with 
history of multiple SBOs, ?malabsorption, B12 equivocal at 334, 
together with Fe deficiency may have caused a normocytic 
anemia/cytopenias.  Started B12 supplementation at time of 
discharge.  After giving aggressive bowel regimen ___, patient 
had several BMs, the last of which this AM was mixed with red 
blood, most likely bleeding internal hemorrhoids.  Given that Hb 
was stable (8.4->8.7), patient cleared for discharge with close 
outpatient follow-up with her PCP to monitor CBC.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male without medical care 
for several years, no known past medical history, who initially 
presented to ___ on ___ with SOB and palpitations. 

In the ED at ___ he was found to be in afib with RVR to 
150s and respiratory distress. He was initially on BiPAP and 
weaned to ___.  CXR showed bialteral infiltrates concerning for 
pulmonary edema. Troponin was mildly elevated to 0.16, BNP was 
1066. An EKG showed lateral STD and cardiology was consulted. He 
was initially given ASA but heparin gtt was not started due to 
concern for AAA (See below). He was initially treated with 
diltiazem gtt and admitted to the ICU. An echo was obtained due 
to pulmonary edema and orthopnea and revealed a LVEF 35%, 
mild-mod global hypokinesis of inferior wall and septum, mod AI, 
mod AS, mod MR, mod TR, and mod pulmonary HTN. There was also 
moderate dilation of the aortic root and ascending aorta. No 
significant pericardial effusion was seen.  

The patient's labs were also notable for a marked leukocytosis 
with L-shift including 2% blasts. Due to concern for infection a 
CTA chest with CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast was obtained 
to rule out infectious source and PE. There was no PE or 
evidence of infection but a 6cm infrarenal AAA with possible 
evidence of impending rupture was seen. Dr. ___ at ___ 
reviewed the images urgently and felt no evidence of imminent 
rupture but transfer was initiated. 

While in the ICU he was switched from diltiazem to esmolol gtt 
and diuresed with IV Lasix with improvement in his orthopnea. 
The CTA had also been notable for bilateral pleural effusions 
and infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema. 

On arrival to ___ the patient reports feeling improved without 
any pain or discomfort. He relays the following history: He last 
had a physical ___ years ago as part of being a ___ 
___. He has no known medical history. At baseline he has no 
functional limitation with walking on flat ground and can walk 
up at lest 2 flights of stairs without needing to stop for air. 
He has no orthopnea, PND, leg swelling, palpitations, or chest 
pain at baseline. He had no fevers, chills, URI symptoms, n/v/d 
prior to this presentation. 

He has smoked 1ppd for at least ___ years, 2 ppd for the last 
year, and quit 3 weeks ago. He previously drank 5 mixed drinks 
per week but cut back to 3 mixed drinks per week 6 months ago 
with no history of alcohol withdrawal. No recreational drugs, no 
new sexual contacts and no history of STDs.

___
CONCLUSION:
The left atrial volume index is SEVERELY increased. The right 
atrium is mildly enlarged. The estimated right atrial pressure 
is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with a borderline increased/dilated cavity. There is 
normal regional left ventricular systolic function. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed. There is 
beat-to-beat variability in the left
ventricular contractility due to the irregular rhythm. The 
visually estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is 45-50%. 
Left ventricular cardiac index is normal (>2.5 L/min/m2). (-10.4 
%; normal less
than -20%) There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract 
gradient. Mildly dilated right ventricular
cavity with normal free wall motion. The aortic sinus diameter 
is normal for gender with normal
ascending aorta diameter for gender. The aortic arch diameter is 
normal with a mildly dilated descending
aorta. The abdominal aorta is severely dilated. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are moderately thickened.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.5 
cm2). However, dimensionless index is 0.26
when using the same beat that exhibits highest peak velocity 
through the aortic valve. There is mild to
moderate [___] aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets 
are mildly thickened with no mitral valve
prolapse. Torn mitral valve chordae are seen. There is mild [1+] 
mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild [1+] tricuspid 
regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: 1) Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction suggesting 
CAD in LCX territory. Global
longitudinal strain is moderately depressed. 2) Moderate aortic 
stenosis by aortic valve area
however the dimensionless index borders to severe aortic 
stenosis repeat evaluation of aortic
stenosis severity in sinus rhythm may bring clarity about true 
severity of aortic stenosis. 3) The
patient has significant mitral annular calcification and 
thickening of the mitral valve leaflets with
reverbaration artifact in the left atrium however a small 
echogenicity on the posterior mitral
annulus cannot be excluded. If clinically indicated a TEE may 
improve visualization.

+TEE ___
CONCLUSION:
There is moderate/severe spontaneous echo contrast in the body 
of the left atrium and in the left atrial appendage. A probable 
xx cm left atrial appendage thrombus is seen. The left atial 
appendage ejection
velocity is very depressed. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen 
in the body of the right atrium or right atrial appendage. There 
is no evidence for an atrial septal defect by 2D/color Doppler. 
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch with complex (>4mm, 
non-mobile) atheroma in the descending aorta to 35cm from the 
incisors. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are moderately 
thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. No abscess is seen. There is trace aortic 
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately 
thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral 
valve. No abscess is seen. There is mild to
moderate [___] mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve 
leaflets appear structurally normal. No mass/ vegetation are 
seen on the tricuspid valve. No abscess is seen. There is mild 
[1+] tricuspid regurgitation.
IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast with 
probable formation of sludge/thrombus in the left atrial 
appendage. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. Complex 
atheroma in the descending aorta.

SUMMARY
========
Mr. ___ is a ___ male without medical care 
for several years, no known past medical history, who initially 
presented to ___ on ___ with SOB and palpitations, 
found to have heart failure (acute, unclear if chronic 
component), afib with RVR, leukocytosis with left shift, and 
infrarenal 6cm AAA. 

====================
ACUTE MEDICAL ISSUES
====================
#6cm infrarenal AAA: CT read at outside hospital raised 
concerning for evidence of hemorrhage into wall and weakening of 
wall concerning for impending rupture. However, per review by 
Dr. ___ ___ vascular surgery team there was no 
radiographic evidence of rupture and emergent surgery was not 
indicated. Vascular surgery team saw him in house and 
recommended optimization of cardiac problems before proceeding 
with an elective AAA repair. To further evaluate the AAA, we 
obtained a dedicated CTA abdomen. Vascular surgery reviewed 
imaging and appears amenable to physician modified ___. He 
was asymptomatic from the AAA standpoint. 

From a cardiology standpoint, we would like to treat with 
uninterrupted anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks at which time 
we will repeat TEE to assess atrial thrombus. If thrombus has 
resolved, consider for cardioversion pending repeat assessment 
of EF at that time. If has cardioversion, would need to be 
followed by another 4 weeks of uninterrupted anticoagulation. 

# HFrEF, acute: Initial Outside hospital TTE showed LVEF 35% 
with inferior WMA, moderate MR/TR, moderate AI and AS while 
patient was in atrial fibrillation. On repeat at ___ while in 
afib with improved rate control showed LVEF 45-50%. He reported 
no functional limitations at home prior to this incident without 
PND, or orthopnea. He underwent a cardiac cath on ___ which 
showed coronary disease (99% stenosis of distal LCx) though not 
significant enough to explain his degree of cardiomyopathy. 
Suspect cardiomyopathy is tachycardia-mediated and may improve 
with cardioversion. Should plan for cardioversion if repeat TEE 
in 4 weeks shows resolution of atrial thrombus and persistent 
reduced EF while in atrial fibrillation. Will discharge on every 
other day dosing of lasix 20 mg. 

# NSTEMI: Presented with lateral STDs on EKG on admission, mild 
troponinemia which has not been rising. Suspect this represents 
a type II NSTEMI secondary to demand ischemia, however could 
have had a missed event several days prior to admission. Cardiac 
cath did show significant a 99% stenosis of distal LCx which was 
not revascularized as did not seem to be supplying significant 
portion of myocardium and given need for surgery in near future 
did not want to commit patient to ___ year of uninterrupted DAPT. 
Optimized medication regimen with ASA, statin, and beta blocker.

# A. fib w/ RVR: Unclear trigger, but suspect may have been 
missed ischemic event as above. Patient was initially held off 
of anticoagulation due to possible need for surgery but once 
deemed stable was started on apixaban 5mg BID (CHADs2-VASc score 
is 4). Patient was initially started on an esmolol gtt but 
eventually transitioned to PO metoprolol succinate 200mg QAM and 
100mg QPM and PO digoxin 0.125mg daily with good control of 
rates. Patient had a TEE in anticipation of cardioversion but 
discovered a left atrial thrombus so cardioversion was aborted. 
Patient will need to remain on uninterrupted for 4 weeks and 
have a repeat TEE at that time to assess for resolution of 
atrial thrombus.  Should also assess ejection fraction at that 
time and if still compromised, consider cardioversion for 
possible tachycardia mediated cardiomyopathy.

# Leukocytosis: Patient presented with leukocytosis in the range 
of ___ with no clear evidence of infection clinically or on 
imaging. In ___ he had had a WBC of 18 on outside labs which he 
brought in for our review. Heme/onc reviewed smear which 
contained signficant left shift and circulating blast count of 
2%. No dysplastic features seen. He was initially given ATRA on 
___ due to concern for APML. However,given the absence of a 
significant number of circulating blasts in the periphery this 
was felt to be unlikely. ___ was sent for BCR/ABL PCR and was 
negative.  This effectively excludes a diagnosis of chronic 
myelogenous leukemia.  Per heme/onc, given low blast count and 
leukocytosis on previous testing, very unlikely to be an acute 
leukemia.  On ___, patient underwent bone marrow biopsy.  
Results pending.  Patient has a follow-up appointment with the 
oncology team on ___ to review results of bone marrow biopsy.
  
# ___: Unknown baseline, Cr 1.8 on admission downtrended to 1.1 
on discharge.  Likely cardiorenal in the setting of heart 
failure exacerbation on admission.  Patient was given IV 
diuresis with improvement in creatinine.  Patient likely has 
mild CKD although do not have baseline to compare to.

# s/p Tobacco use disorder: had quit prior to admission. 

====================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
====================
[] Atrial fibrillation and left atrial thrombus: Rate is well 
controlled at discharge on metoprolol and digoxin.  Patient 
should remain on Eliquis 5 mg twice daily uninterrupted and 
should have repeat TEE in 4 weeks to reassess left atrial 
thrombus.  If ejection fraction still compromised at that time 
please consider cardioversion for potential tachycardia induced 
cardiomyopathy.
[] Should have repeat digoxin level drawn on ___ to make sure 
at therapeutic level given possible interaction with statin.
[] Please check BMP 1 week after discharge and if creatinine 
stable consider starting an ACE inhibitor to optimize heart 
failure treatment.
[] On CT torso patient was noted to have several sub-solid 
pulmonary nodules measuring less than 6 mm for which follow-up 
with CT chest in ___ months as recommended by radiology.
[] Bone marrow biopsy results are pending at time of discharge.  
Patient will follow-up appointment with hematology to review 
results as outpatient.  Please ensure patient is aware of 
appointment and any hematology recommendations.
[] Patient will be discharged on Lasix 20 mg every other day.  
Patient advised to check his weight daily and notify his 
physician if weight increases by more than 3 pounds in 1 day.  
If weight continues to increase will likely need to uptitrate 
diuretic and increased frequency.

Discharge Instructions:
 Dear Mr. ___,
  
It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___!  

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?  
==========================   
- You were admitted because your heart rate was very fast and 
you were short of breath.

WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL?  
==============================  
- You were transferred to ___ due to concern about an enlarged 
blood vessel in your abdomen (AAA).
- Vascular surgery reviewed your imaging and will plan on 
surgery when your heart rate is stabilized and they can 
interrupt your anticoagulation.
- You were diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. Your heart rate 
was controlled with medications (metoprolol and digoxin). 
- You were also started on a blood thinner (apixaban AKA 
ELiquis) for stroke prevention. 
- You were found to have a blood clot in your heart, which means 
your anticoagulation needs to be uninterrupted for 4 weeks.   
- You underwent a bone marrow biopsy on ___ and you tolerated 
the procedure well. 

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME?  
================================  
- Please take all your medications as prescribed.
- Please arrange to establish with a primary care doctor within 
1 week of discharge.
- Please go to your follow up appointments as scheduled below 
with cardiology, hematology, and vascular surgery.
- Please refrain from showering for 24 hours after your bone 
marrow biopsy.
- You will need to remain on anticoagulation (eliquis) 
uninterrupted for at least the next 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, you 
should undergo another transesophageal echocardiogram to 
reassess the clot. If it has resolved, then you should discuss 
with your Cardiologist about cardioversion.
- Your surgeon will be in coordination with your Cardiologist to 
decide the safest timing of surgery.
- Weigh yourself when you get home and every morning. If your 
weight changes more than 2 lbs. within 24 hours, call your 
physician for management of your heart failure medications.

Thank you for allowing us to be involved in your care, we wish 
you all the best!

Cardiac Cath ___
=====================
Coronary Description
The coronary circulation is right dominant.
LM: The Left Main, arising from the left cusp, is a large 
caliber vessel. This vessel bifurcates into the Left Anterior 
Descending and Left Circumflex systems. LAD: The Left Anterior 
Descending artery, which arises from the LM, is a large caliber 
vessel. There is a severe thrombus with a TIMI flow grade of 0 
in the mid segment. There is a 100% stenosis in the mid segment. 
The Septal Perforator, arising from the proximal segment, is a 
small caliber vessel. The ___ Diagonal, arising from the 
proximal segment, is a medium caliber vessel. The ___ Diagonal, 
arising from the mid segment, is a medium caliber vessel. There 
is a 100% stenosis in the proximal segment. There is a severe 
thrombus in the proximal, mid, and distal segments. Cx: The 
Circumflex artery, which arises from the LM, is a large caliber 
vessel. The ___ Obtuse Marginal, arising from the proximal 
segment, is a medium caliber vessel. The ___ Obtuse Marginal, 
arising from the mid segment, is a medium caliber vessel. RCA: 
The Right Coronary Artery, arising from the right cusp, is a 
large caliber vessel. The Acute Marginal, arising from the 
proximal segment, is a small caliber vessel. The Right Posterior 
Descending Artery, arising from the distal segment, is a medium 
caliber vessel. The Right Posterolateral Artery, arising from 
the distal segment, is a medium caliber vessel. 

Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: Percutaneous coronary 
intervention (PCI) was performed on an ad hoc basis based on the 
coronary angiographic findings from the diagnostic portion of 
this procedure. A 6 ___ EBU3.5 guide provided adequate 
support. Crossed with a Runthrough wire into the distal LAD. 
Predilated with a 2.0 mm balloon and then aspiration 
thrombectomy x 2 passes. Significant improvement in thrombus 
burden. Final angiography revealed normal flow, no dissection 
and 0% residual stenosis. Diagnonal 2 with thrombus was wired 
and dottered with improvement in flow. The procedure was not 
feasible without moderate sedation. There were no clinically 
significant complications.
Findings
 Single vessel coronary artery disease.
 Acute occlusion of the LAD. After aspiration thrombectomy 
(large clots aspirated), there was no lesion (plaque, dissection 
or residual thromus) seen in the mid and distal LAD by ___. 
Thrombus in the diagonal also improved after ""dottering"". No 
stent placed.

The testicular echogenicity is normal, without focal 
abnormalities. 
The epididymides are normal bilaterally. 
Vascularity is normal and symmetric in the testes and 
epididymides. 
  
In the sitting and standing positions the testes are similar in 
appearance 
with symmetrical flow visualized on Doppler imaging.  No hernia 
is visualized. 
  
IMPRESSION: Normal scrotal ultrasound.  Images were obtained in 
the supine, sitting and standing positions and no abnormality 
was identified. 

___ Focused TTE with Bubble Study
==================================
CONCLUSION: There is no evidence of an atrial septal defect or 
patent foramen ovale by 2D/color Doppler or agitated saline at 
rest and with maneuvers. There is SEVERE regional left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis to akinesis of 
the distal half of the left ventricle. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function appears moderately to severely depressed. 
Compared with the prior TTE (images reviewed) of ___, LV 
function appears similar to slightly more vigorous at the base. 
Saline contrast was used in this study to evaluate the 
interatrial septum.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:
=========
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male who was recently admitted for 
L2-5 laminectomy who presented initially to CHA with chest pain 
found to have STEMI, transferred to ___ for cath and 
management.

#CORONARIES: Single vessel CAD, 100% occlusion, now s/p 
thrombectomy.
#PUMP: LVEF25-30% (___)
#RHYTHM: Sinus

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES 
=========================== 
- Warfarin for ___ months for thrombus formation prevention, 
repeat TTE in 3 months to see if he still needs it
- Will receive Ziopatch at ___ Cardiology f/u visit to assess 
if afib (?cardioembolic process to STEMI)
- Not on ASA given on AC, needs to be restarted if comes off of 
warfarin
- PCP, ___, Spine appointments post-discharge

ACUTE ISSUES: 
============= 
#Anterior STEMI
#Apical Akinesis
Patient presented initially to CHA with ___ minutes of chest 
pain. EKG demonstrated ST elevations in V1-4. He was given 
aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin gtt, nitro, and morphine and 
transferred to ___ for further management. On arrival, he was 
taken to the cath lab where a thrombectomy of the LAD was 
performed. No stents were placed. There were no residual 
coronary artery disease visualized on the cath, raising concern 
for an embolic source of the stroke. Plan is for him to follow 
up with Dr. ___ in clinic to arrange for ziopatch placement 
in order to quantify any possible paroxysmal atrial 
fibrillation, although we did not identify this on telemetry 
during his stay. He had a negative TTE with bubble study. He has 
a newly depressed ejection fraction of ___. The patient was 
started on aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, metoprolol, and 
lisinopril for cardioprotection. He was started on warfarin for 
prevention of thrombus prevention given apical akinesis; he 
should receive a follow up TTE in 3 months post-discharge to 
assess return of function and possible cessation of warfarin. On 
discharge, his INR was 2.1.

#Scrotal swelling
Patient was very concerned about a described ""dusky"" 
discoloration of the scrotal skin skin his recent laminectomy. 
The patient was evaluated by Ortho Spine and Urology. Urology 
felt it could be related to nerve damage after recent spine 
surgery. Can continue to monitor.

#S/p laminectomy
Patient was recently admitted on ___ for severe central canal 
stenosis at L3-L4 with almost complete obliteration, consistent 
with cauda equina and had a laminectomy performed. Ortho Spine 
saw pt during this hospitalization and advised outpatient follow 
up 2 weeks post-discharge.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: ___ y/o female with a PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and breast 
cancer who presented to the ED s/p mechanical fall and was found 
to be hypoxic.   
.  
# s/p mechanical fall: In the emergency department the patient 
had a plain film done of her left hip as well as CT scan of the 
pelvis which showed no evidence of fracture. She did have some 
initial improvement in her hip pain with addition of Percocet 
and tramadol as needed, however still had some unsteadiness on 
her feet due to pain. The physical therapy team evaluated her 
and felt that she would be safest to go to a rehabilitation 
facility to rebuild her strength before going home. She 
continued to improve with each physical therapy session.
.
# Hypoxia: The patient was noted to have an O2 sat of <85% on RA 
on the ED and was started on 4L O2 NC. This was then weaned to 
2L. On room air she repeatedly had O2 sats between 85-88% and 
<88% upon ambulation on room air. Upon review of the records 
this appears to be a common occurrence upon hospitalization that 
she has been hypoxic and requiring oxygen. She however, has been 
completely asymptomatic related to this. She had a CTA which 
showed no evidence of PE, but did show evidence of diffuse 
emphysema which was in accordance with what was seen on prior 
CTA a year ago. As a result she was scheduled for follow-up in 
___ clinic with Dr. ___ at the end of ___. She 
remained asymptomatic throughout her hospital stay.
.  
# UTI: Pt was asymptomatic, however had a urinalysis revealing 
many WBCs in her urine upon arrival to the emergency department. 
She was initially treated with levofloxacin and then switched to 
ciprofloxacin for a total of a three day course. She would 
benefit from repeat U/A and culture after discharge given a 
history of frequent UTIs in the past and episode of urosepsis on 
past admission requiring ICU care.
.  
# Acute renal failure: Pt with a rise in creatinine from 1.0 to 
1.3 on day of discharge. Her HCTZ was held and she was 
encouraged to drink plenty of liquids. This level should be 
checked upon discharge and she may need IV hydration if unable 
to take enough po for likely prerenal etiology.
.
# HTN: She had good blood pressure control with SBPs in 
120s-140. She was continued on home amlodipine, metoprolol and 
valsartan. 
.  
# Type II DM: She was continued on her home dose of glipizide 
and monitored with Humalog sliding scale infrequently as needed.

___ blocker that could have influenced her heart rate. No 
sign of tachycardia to suggest SSS or brady-tachyarrhytmnia 
either. Patient had her dose of beta-blocker reduced to 
metoprolol 25 mg Daily and she was monitored on telemetry 
throughout her stay.  Heart rates off of metoprolol entirely had 
been in the 90's without any pauses, and on 25mg daily of 
metoprolol her heart rates were in the ___ without any pauses.  
Given her apparent marked sensititivity to beta blocker therapy 
and lack of any abnormalities on extended telemetry, further 
syncope evaluation with EP study was not performed.  Her HCTZ 
and valsartan were left in the same dosage (a brief increase in 
these medications had resulted in relative hypotension). She did 
not have abnormalities on telemetry and did not have any other 
syncopal episode.  If she develops recurrent syncope or near 
syncope, she should undergo electrophysiology study.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ F with history of CKD, dementia, HTN, DMII, presenting from 
clinic with worsening hypertension, altered mental status and 
acute renal failure.

# Delirium - the patient was found to be delirious on admission. 
 Initial workup, including blood work, cultures and head CT scan 
was negative.  A paronychia of her right large toe was found 
which was drained; pain from the paronychia may have contributed 
to her initial delirium. Geriatrics was consulted, and the 
patient received supportive measures such as better pain 
control, a bowel regimen and attempts to preserve her sleep wake 
cycle.  She was agitated at times, and responded poorly to 
olanzapine but did improve with daily seroquel 6.25 at night, 
which was later increased to 12.5 to help improve her sleep/wake 
cycle.  A urinalysis was later re-checked which did demonstrate 
a urinary tract infection and she was treated with IV 
ceftriaxone for 3 days. Finally, her delirium might have been 
worsened by constipation, which was treated with disimpaction.

# Urinatry tract infection - treated as above.

# Hypertension - the patient had a blood pressure elevated with 
systolic pressures in the 200s at clinic prior to admission.  
She was continued on valsartan and amlodipine, and hydralazine 
10mg bid was added to her regimen, resulting in good blood 
pressure control.

# Diabetes - the patient was not on any oral anti-hyperglycemics 
on admission as her PCP had discontinued these 3 weeks prior.  
She was started on a humalog sliding scale and lantus.

#Acute renal failure - This resolved quickly with IV fluids. 

#Code status: The patient was confirmed to be DNR/DNI with the 
family.

#Transition of care issues: Geriatrics recommended discontinuing 
the rosuvastatin and omeprazole if they are not needed.  This 
should be discussed with the patient's primary care provider.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with a h/o DM2, CAD s/p stenting and CABG for 3 prior MIs, 
s/p repair of buried penis with phalloplasty and skin graft 
___, who presented with hematuria, anemia, and ___ on CKD 
after foley was removed s/p the procedure
 
# Acute blood loss anemia
# Hematuria: developed hematuria soon after Foley removal. 
Urology followed patient, and bleeding from inside urethra 
thought to be from traumatic foley removal. Did not appear to be 
a bladder or renal/urethral source since he was noted to be 
bleeding from around catheter rather than within and in the 
hospital had clear urine, and normal renal/bladder ultrasound. 
Graft was evaluated by plastics and appeared to be healing well. 
He required 3 units of PRBCs throughout hospitalization after 
presenting with Hgb of 6.9 at OSH (baseline 10). His discharge 
Hgb was 8.1. He continued to bleed intermittently throughout 
admission, especially after moving/walking. He remained 
hemodynamically stable.

# Hyperkalemia: Patient had intermittent hyperkalemia during 
admission with a high of 6.4, more recently 5.2-5.3. Unclear 
etiology, but possibly ___ hemolyzed blood products or poor 
kidney function or both. Restarted diuretic on ___, changed to 
bumex given sulfa allergy. EKG x 2 has been reassuring.  
 - continue to trend  
 - continue bumex  

# ___ on CKD: Cr 2.9 on admission, 2.3 at discharge, from 
baseline in 1.7-2.2 range.  Likely developed prerenal ___ in 
setting of blood loss. Transfused as above. Held home 
furosemide, lisinopril, atenolol initially, and restarted 
atenolol at lower dose, and bumex instead of lisinopril (see 
transitional issues below)
 
# Leukocytosis
# Bandemia and atypical WBCs on Diff:  He had no infectious 
symptoms. CXR was negative for infection. Urine culture and 
blood cultures were obtained and were negative. Ongoing 
intermittent mild elevation.
 
# CAD/HTN/HLD: no active symptoms or new EKG changes. Held home 
ASA given bleeding, continued home rosuvatstain

Transitional Issues:
====================
- ___ should remain in place until it can be evaluated by 
urology. Patient to have appointment with them in ___ days.
- Urology expects lesion to bleed in coming days. Ok if there is 
moderate blood soaking through pads. Check H/H and if drop of 2 
points in hemoglobin or < 7, patient will need transfusion.
- Ok to wash area of skin graft daily with saline-soaked gauze 
lightly once daily, and place bacitracin on it after 
- CHANGED: Atenolol was initially held in the setting of 
bradycardia to ___, then restarted at lower dose (12.5mg). 
Consider changing given it is renally cleared. 
- STOPPED Lasix 80mg PO daily given it may be too high a dose, 
and given the sulfa moiety on it, and patient's sulfa allergy
- STARTED Bumex at 1mg (equivalent to 40mg Lasix)
- please check daily weights, and consider titrating bumex to 
2mg if necessary
- HELD lisinopril in setting of kidney injury. Consider 
restarting as outpatient
- Please check CBC, Chem 7 on ___ 
- HELD aspirin with active bleeding. Consider starting in the 
next ___ days.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It has been a pleasure taking part in your care at the hospital. 
You were admitted because you were having bleeding from your 
penis. We think that a tear occurred in the urethra when your 
catheter accidentally came out at rehab. You continued to have 
bleeding at the hospital, especially with movement, and the 
urology team removed your catheter and cystoscopy was performed. 
Bleeding was seen near the end of the urethra, and a larger 
catheter was placed that helped slow down the bleeding. You had 
clear urine over most of the admission, including the last few 
days of the admission. You required transfusions. 

Additionally, you had findings of increased potassium in your 
blood and injury to your kidney. These both improved by the time 
of your discharge.

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO AFTER LEAVING THE HOSPITAL:
1. Work on building up your strength at rehab
2. Keep your catheter in until you are evaluated by the 
urologists in their clinic
3. Continue the decreased dose of atenelol. Discuss with your 
primary care doctor whether to increase it
4. Do not take aspirin or lisinopril until your doctor tells you 
to

___, it has been a pleasure taking part in your care, and we 
wish you the best.
- Your ___ care team

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the Acute Care Surgery Service on ___ 
after a fall sustaining left sided rib fractures. You were given 
pain medication and watched closely to make sure you were able 
to take deep breaths. You were seen and evaluated by the 
physical therapists who recommend that you have ongoing physical 
therapy at home. 

You are now ready to be discharged home with the following 
discharge instructions:

* Your injury caused left sided rib fracture ___ which can cause 
severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths 
because of the pain.
 
* You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead 
of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths. If 
the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and 
notify your physician.
 
* Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to 
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 
times every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small 
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that 
pool in the lungs.
 
* You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold 
against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and 
deep breathing.
 
* Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short 
periods may ease the pain.
 
* Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you 
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid 
and fiber intake if possible.
 
* Do NOT smoke
 
* If your doctor allows, non-steroidal ___ drugs 
are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin, 
Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side 
effects so make sure your doctor approves.
 
* Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute 
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation 
around your ribs (crepitus).

6.) Acute Kidney Injury, on POD#3 her creatinine spiked to 2.5 
from 1.8. This was equivalent to her pre-admission creatinine 
however this remained stable following blood transfusion and 
oral fluids with serial labs. 

Otherwise, pain was initially controlled with a PCA followed by 
a transition to oral pain medications on POD#1.  The patient 
received Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of 
POD#1.  The foley was removed on POD#1 and the patient was 
voiding independently thereafter. The surgical dressing was 
changed on POD#2 and the surgical incision was found to be clean 
and intact without erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient 
was seen daily by physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout 
the hospital course and repleted accordingly. At the time of 
discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling 
well.  The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The 
patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately 
controlled on an oral regimen. The operative extremity was 
neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign. 

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as 
tolerated on the operative extremity.
 
Ms ___ is discharged to rehab in stable condition.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the podiatric surgery service, 
transferred from an outside hostpial on ___ for a 
surgical site infection, right hallux.

Throughout her hospital stay, the patient remained afebrile with 
stable vital signs; pain was well controlled with oral pain 
medication on a PRN basis.  The patient remained stable from 
both a cardiovascular and pulmonary standpoint. He was placed on 
vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and flagyl while hospitalized. On 
hospital day 2, she was seen by the infectious disease team who 
recommended a 6 week course of ancef for cultures growing MSSA. 
Patients intake and output were closely monitored and noted to 
be adequate. The patient received subcutaneous lovenox 
throughout admission; early and frequent ambulation were 
strongly encouraged.

At the outside hospital, the patient received 2 positive tests 
with +HCG in her urine.  The test was repeated here, and while 
it was negative, the serum HCG remained elevated. The Gynecology 
was consulted who recommended obtaining a pelvic ultrasound 
which was negative for a pelvic mass. They recommended she 
follow up with gynecology for a further outpatient workup and 
would contact her in regards to her blood work as well as an 
appointment time.

The patient was subsequently discharged home on hospital day 3. 
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient was discharged home with services. The 
patient received discharge teaching and follow-up instructions 
with understanding verbalized and agreement with the discharge 
plan.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

___ was a pleasure taking care of you at ___. You were admitted 
to the Podiatric Surgery service after your right foot surgery. 
You were given IV antibiotics while here. You were also found to 
have elevation of a hormone in your blood known as HCG, or human 
chorionic gonadotropin hormone. We discussed this with the 
gynecologists who recommended an ultrasound of your pelvis which 
was normal. The gynecologists evaluated you and recommended that 
you follow up with them as an outpatient. You are being 
discharged home with the following instructions: 

ACTIVITY:
There are restrictions on activity. Please remain weight bearing 
as tolerated to your right foot in a surgical shoe until your 
follow up appointment. You should keep this site elevated when 
ever possible (above the level of the heart!) 

No driving until cleared by your Surgeon.
PLEASE CALL US IMMEDIATELY FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS:
Redness in or drainage from your leg wound(s).
New pain, numbness or discoloration of your foot or toes.
Watch for signs and symptoms of infection. These are: a fever 
greater than 101 degrees, chills, increased redness, or pus 
draining from the incision site. If you experience any of these 
or bleeding at the incision site, CALL THE DOCTOR.

Exercise:
Limit strenuous activity for 6 weeks.
No heavy lifting greater than 20 pounds for the next ___ days.
Try to keep leg elevated when able.

BATHING/SHOWERING:
You may shower immediately upon coming home, but you must keep 
your dressing CLEAN, DRY and INTACT. You can use a shower bag 
taped around your ankle/leg or hang your foot/leg outside of the 
bathtub. You should not get your foot wet as this can result in 
worsening infection. You should change your dressing every other 
day by applying gauze with betadine to your wound with a kerlex, 
or gauze wrap to your foot.

Avoid taking a tub bath, swimming, or soaking in a hot tub for 4 
weeks after surgery or until cleared by your physician.

MEDICATIONS:
Unless told otherwise you should resume taking all of the 
medications you were taking before surgery. 
Remember that narcotic pain meds can be constipating and you 
should increase the fluid and bulk foods in your diet. (Check 
with your physician if you have fluid restrictions.) If you feel 
that you are constipated, do not strain at the toilet. You may 
use over the counter Metamucil or Milk of Magnesia. Appetite 
suppression may occur; this will improve with time. Eat small 
balanced meals throughout the day. 

DIET:
There are no special restrictions on your diet postoperatively. 
Poor appetite is not unusual for several weeks and small, 
frequent meals may be preferred.

FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENT:
Be sure to keep your medical appointments. 
If a follow up appointment was not made prior to your discharge, 
please call the office on the first working day after your 
discharge from the hospital to schedule a follow-up visit. This 
should be scheduled on the calendar for seven to fourteen days 
after discharge. Normal office hours are ___ 
through ___.
PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CALL THE OFFICE WITH ANY OTHER CONCERNS OR 
QUESTIONS THAT MIGHT ARISE.

severe anemia and elevated WBC on cbc done today in workup for 
possible transplant.  Patient became febrile after admission to 
the hospital.

# Accelerated phase CML: Patient was anemic on admission and 
transfused.  It was decided that patient should undergo 
myeloablative induction for possible allogeneic stem cell 
transplant.  Patient started induction chemotherapy on ___ 
with cytarabine and idarubicin (7+3) according to protocol.  Her 
dasatinib was held.  Her ANC nadir was ___. Her course was 
complicated by fevers for which she was started on vancomycin 
and cefepime and her PICC line was removed.  Blood cultures, 
urine cultures and stool cultures remained negative. She 
developed a diffuse rash, and dermatology was consulted.  It was 
felt that this may have been a drug rash related to cefepime, 
vancomycin or hydralazine and she was treated with topical 
steroids.  Hydralazine and cefepime were stopped and aztreonam 
was started.  She spiked a temperature of 101 on ___ and

___.  A pre transplant work up was completed as an inpatient, 
including infectious disease consultation and dental 
consultation.

# History of CAD: Patient was continued on her home dose of 
statin.  She was ruled out for myocardial infarction with serial 
cardiac biomarkers.  Her metoprolol was uptitrated during this 
admission due to hypertension and she was discharged on 100 mg 
PO tid. 

# HTN: Patient was initially started on her home dose of 
metoprolol.  She had several episodes of elevated blood pressure 
and her metoprolol was uptitrated to 100mg PO tid.  She was 
started on hydralazine, but it was later stopped ___ drug rash.  
She was started on valsartan 80mg PO daily, with improved 
control of her blood pressure.

experienced some nausea and emesis which was controlled with 
zofran.  Stem cell transplant was performed. Her course was 
complicated by neutropenic fever and she was treated with 
antibiotics. She remained culture negative. She developed 
esophagitis and was found to be negative for CMV but esophaheal 
biopsy suggested esophageal GHVD and also had evidence of skin 
GHVD. She received a tapered course of steroids and improved. 
She also developed intense headaches while she was 
thrombocytopenic. Head CT showed no acute intracranial 
hemorrhage or mass effect, with a few vague dense areas noted in 
the brainstem/posterior fossa, likely being artifactual. Her 
headaches resolved. She was discharged to the oncology 
apartments and will follow closely with the ___ and 
her primary oncologist.

hx suggestive of upper GI GVHD. She was started empirically on 
methylprednisolone 30 mg IV BID, in addition to her Budensonide 
3 mg PO TID, and cyclosporine 125 mg IV q12 for possible GVH 
colitis. Zofran and omeprazole were ordered for her 
nausea/vomiting.  Stools were sent for o&p, bact cultures, viral 
cultures, and clostridium difficile toxin.  Due to her 
continuing diarrhea, CT abdomen done on HD3 which showed 
uncomplicated ileocolitis with continuous involvement of distal 
ileum up to proximal transverse colon just beyond the hepatic 
flexure, suggestive of graft versus host disease or 
infectious/inflammatory etiologies.  The pt. was placed NPO on 
HD3 for colonoscopy, but given her poor PO intake while in the 
hospital, was evaluated and started on TPN by HD4.   While on 
the high dose steroids, the pt's diarrhea did not improve much, 
and she wast started on empiric abx therapy with metronidazole  
500 mg IV qday and levofloxacin 750 mg IV qday (as she was 
allergic to cefepime/possibly penicillins) on HD4.  Stool 
studies all came back negative for infectious etiologies of her 
diarrhea.  Bx results from her colonoscopy were negative for CMV 
but positive for severe graft versus host colitis throughout the 
colon.  Her antibiotics were discontinued, and she was started 
on mycophenolate mofetil 1000 mg po BID and her cyclosporine was 
increased from 175 mg po BID to ___ qAM/qHS.  Her 
diarrhea began to improve, TPN was dc'd on HD 9, and she was 
discharged home on HD12 on CSA, MMF, and IV methylprednisolone 
for control of her GVH colitis.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital due to nausea, vomiting, and 
diarrhea for several days duration.  You had a CT scan of you 
abdomen which showed inflammation.  You were given medications 
for a possible infection in your colon for several days, as well 
as medications for possible Graft Versus Host Disease of the 
colon.  You were evaluated by colon specialists 
(gastroenterologists) who performed a procedure to look at the 
inside of you colon and take biopsies (colonoscopy).  It was 
determined that your diarrhea was NOT from an infection, but due 
to Graft-Versus-Host-Disease (a complication that can happen in 
people with allogenic stem cell transplants).  You were placed 
on large doses of immunosuppressants (Methylprednisolone, 
Cyclosporin, Mycophenolate Mofetil, and Budenoside) to stop your 
immune system from attacking your colon.  Your diarrhea began to 
improve, you were placed on a full low bacteria diet, and 
discharged from the hospital.

___ with CML, s/p allogeneic SCT D 163 (on discharge) with 
post-transplant period complicated by upper and lower GI GVH 
(biopsy ___, s/p treatment with steroids, currently on 
cyclosporin 50 in am, 25 in pm and atovaquone, who presents with 
persistent nausea, vomitting, and diarrhea. Anemic on 
presentation and transfused 2 units of RCC and following a 
seemingly inadequate response on lab tests received a further 2 
units. Started on IV methylprednisolone for ? GVHD and converted 
to an oral steroid taper. Cyclosporin level increased due to low 
level. Deranged LFTs noted and will be repeated in community. 
Found to have an enterobacter UTI and commenced on a 3 days 
course of oral levofloxacin.
.
#Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea: Presented with 5 days of 
symptoms which were improving on admission. For concerns of GVHD 
(see previous history) she was started on IV methylprednisolone 
30mg bid and this was converted to an oral prednisone taper 
following resolution of symptoms by the day after admission. PRN 
ondansetron for nausea. She was found to have moderate LeukE on 
UA although there were only 3WBCs on urine microscopy. She was 
commenced on a 3-day course of oral levofloxacin for her UTI 
(note sensitive to ciprofloxacin on sensitivity testing). Stool 
cultures were negative.
.
#Anemia: She was noted to have a Hb/Hct of 7.1/20.2 in clinic 
and was transfused 2 units RCC. Post transfusion HCt was only 
20.5 (cause unclear) and she received a further 2 units RCC with 
post transfusion labs Hb 9.9 HCt 29.1. Retic count was suitably 
elevated for degree of anemia and other hemolysis screen was 
negative.

# Possible GVHD: Her symptoms were thought to perhaps represent 
mild GVHD although the presence of a UTI may be the cause. She 
was started on a IV methylprednisolone and converted to an oral 
steroid taper. Her cyclosporin dose was increased to 50mg am 
75mg pm following a low cyclosporin level of <30. Continued 
budesonide.
.
#Elevated LFTs: She was noted to have deranged LFTs on admission 
which were not present on previous laboratory testing. There was 
evidence of a transaminitis and increased during admission. She 
will have her blood repeated on ___ with results faxed to Dr 
___.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old woman with CML, s/p MRD allo SCT ___ with 
Busulfan/Cyclophosphamide. Her post-transplant course was 
complicated with GVH of the upper and lower GI tract that 
required hopitalization for IV steroids and increased 
immunosuppression. She was admitted for investigation of 
worsening LFTs. She was treated with high dose IV 
methylprednisolone, oral Mycophenolate mofetil and increasing 
cyclosporin doses. She quickly developed symptoms suggestive of 
GI GVHD with cramping ___ pain, nausea and vomiting. LFTs 
worsened during admission but she did not necessitate a liver 
biopsy due to considerable improvement in these following 
increased immunosuppression. The general picture was that of 
severe multi-organ GVHD. Her GI symptoms worsened with abdominal 
pain and profuse watery diarrhea and she had a CT scan which 
demonstrtaed confluent small bowel enteritis. At this point she 
was placed on bowel rest and administered TPN. GVHD was 
confirmed at endoscopy and biopsy where mucosa was noted to be 
friable and extensively ulcerated in keeping with severe GVHD. 
Her cyclosporin was titrated up and her symptoms improved 
although diarrhea persisted despite a considerable period of 
bowel rest on TPN. Her Hb/HCt had been slowly falling and her 
stool was found to be guaiac +ve felt likely 2o to her bowel 
inflammation. She was found to have a swollen left arm shortly 
after a PICC line was placed and there was evidence of an 
extensive LUE DVT extending to the subclavian vein. This was 
treated conservatively as anticoagulation was felt to be 
inadvisable in the setting of her continued bowel inflamation 
and guaiac +ve stools. Due to problmes of low cyclosporin levels 
her cyclosporina nd mycophenolate were changed to IV on ___. 
WBC count progressively dropped ? cause and she may need a bone 
marrow biopsy soon if her counts do not improve. She was 
continued on IV methylprednisolone mycophenolate and cyclosporin 
w/continued TPN for bowel rest. Blood glucoses high and 
titrating up insulin in TPN in addition to addingNPH low dose 
BID on ___. Gradually, diarrhea improved and pt was able to be 
transitioned slowly to PO medications. Levels of cyclosporin 
were monitored to ensure therapuetic range and absorptions. 
Slowly pt's diet was also advanced and at discharge pt was off 
TPN. Closes follow-up was planned on ___.
.
# Rising LFTs:  This was found to be liver GVHD.  Progressively 
settling following GVHD treatment. Mildly elevated on previous 
admission in week prior to current admission. She was initially 
asymptomatic although latterly developed severe diarrhea, nausea 
and vomiting. Her steroids initially oral prednisone were 
increased to IVMP 30mg bid and cyclosporin was gradually 
uptitrated. She had ___ U/S ___ which showed focal fatty 
infiltrate and nil else. Bil rose from 1.6 on ___ and 
transaminases were progressively rising. MRCP on ___ showed 
hemosiderosis of liver and spleen, thickening of duodenum and 
___ jejunum in keeping with inflammatory/infectious etiology 
and a small stone in GB. Seen by hepatology ___ and lab 
investigations for vit D,  Hep B/C/Adeno/CMV/HHV6/EBV PCRs, Hep 
A Ab, HSV Ab. These all came back -ve save vit D level which was 
low and seh was sterted on vitamin D supplementation. Put on 
bowel rest and started on TPN. Bil rose from 1.6 to 5.7 on ___ 
with improved transaminases. By repeat on ___ Bil level had 
dropped to 5.1 and by ___ Bil dropped to 2.9 with improved 
transaminases. She therefore did not go for liver bx. LFTs 
continued to trend down with high levels of immunosuppression. 
Slowly immunosuppression was titrated down and LFTs remained 
stable as diarrhea continued to improve. Transition to PO 
fluconazole resulted in rise in LFTs w/out evidence of other 
worsening GVHD symptoms so pt was restarted on home 
voriconazole. LFTs will continued to be monitored as meds are 
titrated on an outpt basis.
.
# CML: s/p allo SCT. She continues to recover from her 
transplant. Guaiac +ve stol ___ and transfused 1 unit 
___. Transfusion goal HCt >25 Plt >20. 
.
# GVHD ___ pain, nausea and  vomiting and elevated LFTs): 
Previous significant upper and lower GI GVHD. She ws found on 
this admission to again have severe GVHD in his case involving 
the small bowel and liver. On admission she was started on IV 
methylpred 30mg bid. Whilst she was asymptomatic on admission, 
she quickly developed abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting felt 
likely to be GVHD. Increased cyclosporin to 75mg bid, added 
mycophenolate 500mg bid and voriconazole 200mg bid on ___. 
Increased mycophenolate to 1g bid on ___. Cyclosporin 119 and 
increased cyclosporin to 100mg bid ___ then 125mg bid ___. As 
high level changed to 125/100 on ___. Cyclopsorin increased to 
125mg bid ___ and 150mg bid ___ due to persistently low 
levels and felt that this was likely due to poor absorption from 
the gut. SShe had suprapubic tenderness with diarrhea as of ___ 
- NOT peritonitic. Initially felt to be ? inadequately treated 
UTI (Enterobacter in UCx in week prior and Rx levo for 3 days). 
Rpt UA and UCx were -ve. Started on oral cipro ___.. Due to 
diarrhea was changed to IV cipro/metronidazole ___. MRI showed 
duodenitis/jejunitis ? infectious ? inflammatory. Supportive IV 
fluids where given and then TPN was started for nutritional 
support. High stool output. Seen by GI ___ who recommended 
stool studies which were negative. Changed Abx to IV meropenem 
___. ___ ___ showed small bowel enteritis 
encompassing most of small bowel with no dilatation. UGIE and bx 
___ showed abnormal, friable mucosa throughout approximately 
75% of the duodenum which was denuded with a shiny erythematous 
base and could be consistent with known history of GVHD. IV 
meropenem stopped ___. Awaiting CMV immunostaining. EBV 20 
copies and was repeated ___ and was not amplifyable although 
the sample was slightly hemolysed. She symptomatically improved 
although had persistent diarrhea despite bowel rest. She was 
treated with loperamide. Gradually symptoms improved and pt was 
able to be transition from IV meds to PO meds and diet advanced 
slowly while TPN continued until pt was able to tolerated PO 
diet at a sufficient level to maintain calorie needs. At time of 
d/c TPN had been stopped and pt was taking only POs.
.

# L UE DVT: Swollen L arm post PICC insertion. Had U/S and 
doppler ___ which showed edema but no hematoma or localised 
edema but repeat U/S showed Left Basilic DVT ___.  PICC was 
removed on ___. She did not receive anticoagulation given low 
Plts, guaiac +ve stool and significant ulceration on bx 
suggestive of continued significant bowel inflammation. Later pt 
had some intermittent residual swelling in the arm which was 
attibutated to mild edema because of lingering partial occlusion 
in the veins. Repeat US was negative at that time.
.

Imaging:

IMPRESSION: 
 CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 5:43 ___ 
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma. 
2. Left lower lobe consolidation with adjacent small left 
nonhemorrhagic 
pleural effusion. This finding is concerning for infection in 
the appropriate clinical setting. 
3. Increased attenuation of the liver, compatible with 
hemosiderosis, 
unchanged. 
4. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis. 
5. Extensive calcified atherosclerotic disease of the aorta and 
its branches without associated aneurysmal changes. 
6. Right thigh lipoma is partially imaged. 
.
EMG:
IMPRESSION: 
Abnormal study. There is electrophysiologic evidence for a 
myopathy with 
denervating (""inflammatory"") features, most severely affecting 
the lower 
extremities. The findings are not suggestive of an acquired 
demyelinating 
polyneuropathy, such as Guillain- ___ syndrome. 
.
ECHO ___: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial 
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated 
right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are 
normal (LVEF >55%). A mid-cavitary gradient is identified. There 
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the 
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, no 
change. 
.
CHEST CT: report pending at time of discharge
. 
PATHOLOGY:
Muscle biopsy, r4 rectus femoris muscle:
Inflammatory myopathy, see note.
Note: Section showed myofibers with prominent inflammatory 
infiltrate composed of foamy macrophages, lymphocytes, and 
plasma cells.  Degenerative and regenerative fibers are seen.  
In some areas, myofibers are replaced by adipose and connective 
tissue, consistent with a subacute clinical picture. CD3 labeled 
prominent T cell infiltrate with numerous CB8 positive cytotoxic 
and scattered CD4 positive helper cells, while CD20 labeled B 
lymphocytes are rare in perivascular zones. CD68 highlighted 
abundant macrophages, some involved in myophagocytosis. The 
findings would be consistent with GVH myositis in the clinical 
context of CML status post alloSCT and history of GI and liver 
GVH disease. GVH myositis is indistinguishable histologically 
from sporatic polymyositis. Further studies including 
biochemical panel will be reported as an addendum.
.
R forearm: pending at time of discharge

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ female with CAD s/p CABG, accelerated phase CML s/p 
allo SCT ___ complicated by upper and lower GI GVHD ___ 
and liver GVHD ___ presenting from OSH electively intubated 
for hypoxic and hypercarbic failure in the setting of myopathy. 
.
# Hypercarbic hypoxic respiratory failure: Pt was initially 
electively intubated given diffuse myopathy affecting 
respiratory muscles. Pt was managed on endotracheal intubation 
for 11 days before being trached on ___. Her ___ NIF has 
remained (-14)-(-18). During trials on trach collar, she has 
maintained her oxygen saturation and respiratory rate, however 
her blood pressure elevates and she reports subjective feelings 
of dyspnea and fatigue. Goal now for weaning her from the vent 
is treatment of her diffuse myositis to improve respiratory 
failure in the long term with gentle weaning to trach collar.
.
# Motor weakness: Based on muscle biopsy, inflammation is 
consistent with GVHD.  Muscle biopsy shows impressive 
inflammation despite having been on steriods prior to biopsy. 
Muscle strength appeared to initially improve on steroids, 
though now has been stable x 1 week. Following muscle biopsy, 
she was started on cyclosporine 25mg IV BID and received 1 dose 
of IVIG. She has had minimal improvement in her strength and is 
aware that this will be a prolonged recovery process.
.
# Mold on BAL: Sparse growth seen on bronchial aspirate from 
___. Given clinical improvement and radiological improvement 
on CT scan ___, we do not feel that this is likely a pathogenic 
organism. We do recommend repeat CT chest in ___ weeks for 
continued monitoring. 
.
# depression: Ms ___ has started to appear overwhelmed and 
frustrated by her current condition and long term recovery that 
is necessary. We have deferred starting an SSRI but this should 
be reconsidered outside of an acute hospitalization.
.
# Pancytopenia: Developed in setting of starting cyclosporine. 
Her CBC has been stable and she has not required any recent 
transfusions. Threshold for transfusion would be platelets <10, 
hct <25
.
# bilateral hand bullae: First noticed on ___. Dermatology was 
consulted and felt that her purpura was due to trauma and her 
coagulopathy.  The bullae were probably the result of hemorrhage 
into thin skin. They were drained and per derm, continued with 
light pressure dressings to prevent re-accumulation.
.
# Hypertension: Pt has history of hypertension and had been 
managed at home on amlodipine 5mg, and metoprolol succinate 
300mg ___. These were initially held on presentation, but 
resumed as she improved clinically. She has been stable on 
amlodipine 5mg ___, metoprolol tartrate 100mg q6hr, and 
captopril 12.5mg TID. She has been noted to get hypertensive to 
170s when on trach collar. We would expect this to resolve as 
she becomes more comfortable on the trach collar and her 
strength improves. It would be possible to up titrate her 
captopril if she requires.
.
# DVT: Pt has bilateral DVT, however in setting of diffuse 
ecchymoses and hematomas, heparin drip was held. Pt had CTA at 
outside hospital to r/o PE and had an IVC filter placed.  She 
was placed on compression stockings to avoid further 
complications of thrombophlebitis.
.
# Elevated LFTs: LFT have been stably elevated during this 
hospitalization, likely secondary to her known GVHD.
.
# elevated PTT: Unclear etiology since patient has been off 
heparin drip for 1 week now. She is still getting heparin SQ TID 
and suspect that given decreased muscle mass, she may be 
supratheraputic from SQ heparin alone. Further work up is 
pending, including ___, anti-cardiolipin antibody, and 
anti-lupus antibody.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
.
# CML s/p allogeneic stem cell tx: Pt was continued on acyclovir 
and atovaquone for prophylaxis. She had been on budesonide, 
however this has been held recent as it cannot be given through 
her dobhoff. She has been started on cyclosporin and IVIG for 
diffuse myositis.
.
# CAD: s/p CABG in ___. Continued home medications. Repeat ECHO 
here showed no wall motion abnormalities. She also had cardiac 
catheterization at outside hospital for workup of initial 
presenting dyspnea which revealed clean coronary arteries.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
Pt is full code.
.
She will require repeat IVIG either ___ or ___ per 
rheumatology recs.
.
She should have repeat CT chest in ___ weeks for follow up on 
interval change in L infiltrate.
.
We have decreased her heparin SQ to BID given persistently 
elevated PTT. This should be re-evaluated if remains elevated 
and further work-up would be warranted.
.
We have resumed home blood pressure medications. If necessary, 
her captopril could be up titrated.
.
Patient and her husband are aware that she will have a prolonged 
recovery period. She has expressed some thoughts of depression 
and would likely benefit from an SSRI.
.
Tube feds currently Beneprotein, 21 gm/day, Goal rate: 40 ml/hr, 
Residual Check: q4h Hold feeding for residual >= : 200 ml
.
Pt has not been getting her budesonide as it clogs her dobhoff. 
This should be discussed with hem/onc at her follow up visit.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___. You were admitted for difficulty breathing and 
had a breathing tube placed to help. This was transitioned to a 
tracheostomy. You had a muscle biopsy done to determine what 
caused your weakness. It looks like your graft versus host 
disease caused damage to your muscle and affected your 
respiratory muscles. You were started on a new medicine called 
cyclosporin and got 1 dose of IVIG to treat the muscle weakness. 
You were also continued on steroids. There was some concern for 
a pneumonia, though this looks like it has resolved on your most 
recent CT scan. Your feeding tube was left in place for you to 
get adequate nutrition until your muscle strength improves.

We will send a complete list of your medications to the ___.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with a history of 
accelerated CML s/p allo-MRD SCT ___ complicated by GVHD of 
the liver, gut, myositis necessitating intubation due to 
respiratory muscle weakness.  She presented with worsening 
blood-streaked diarrhea and elevated LFTs, with hospitalization 
complicated by multiple DVTs and resulting BRBPR caused by 
heparin gtt, with BRBPR, and recurrent C. diff infection.
.
#. DIARRHEA: ___ GVHD and recurrent C diff. Patient has been 
having blood-streaked diarrhea since admission likely secondary 
to GVHD, which progressed to BRBPR with clots after starting 
heparin gtt for DVTs (see below). Heparin was discontinued, but 
patient with continued diarrhea. On ___ C. diff toxin was 
found positive. Pt has had multiple episodes of C diff in past, 
and prophylactic PO vanco had been discontinued on ___. She 
was started on IV flagyl on ___ for her positive C diff), then 
switched to vanco 500mg PO q6hrs per GI recs (used for recurrent 
c diff: 250-500mg PO q6hrs x14 days, then taper). Diarrhea 
progressively improved after this. Patient also has chronic gut 
and liver GVHD. She had EGD and colonoscopy on ___, which 
showed 2 whitish cecal plaques/nodules with biopsy showing focal 
active ileitis, rare apoptotic crypt cells in 
ileum/ascending/transverse colon consistent with (but not 
specific for) GVHD. Also had ileocecal valve nodules composed of 
""predominantly fibrinopurulent exudate consistent with ulcer and 
a very minute strip of surface epithelium"". EGD/colonoscopy 
biopsies were found negative for AFB, fungi, CMV, viruses. For 
her C diff, patient is discharged on Vancomycin 500mg PO q6

Bone Marrow Bx 
HYPOCELLULAR BONE MARROW WITH TRILINEAGE HEMATOPOIESIS AND 
DECREASED MEGAKARYOCYTES.  NO MORPHOLOGIC EVIDENCE OF 
TRANSFORMATION OR HEMOPHAGOCYTIC SYNDROME ARE SEEN.  SEE NOTE.

Note: The findings overall suggest marrow suppression, perhaps 
related to TKIs, rather than hemophagocytic syndrome, i.e. there 
are only occasional hemophagocytic macrophages present, with 
hemosiderin-laden macrophages predominating, and no overt marrow 
""damage"" seen. 

Colon Bx:
Random colon, mucosal biopsies:
Colonic mucosa with focal crypt atrophy and dropout with rare 
basal crypt epithelial cell apoptoses consistent with graft 
versus host disease in the appropriate clinical setting; no 
viral cytopathic effect seen; see note.
Note: Given rare neutrophilic crypt abscesses, a concomitant 
acute infectious process cannot entirely be excluded. 
Immunostain for cytomegalovirus is in progress and will be 
reported in an addendum.
ADDENDUM #1: 
Immunostain for cytomegalovirus is negative with satisfactory 
controls.
ADDENDUM #2:
Immunostain for herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 is negative with 
satisfactory controls.

Renal Bx:
KIDNEY (LEFT), CORE BIOPSY:

1.THROMBOTIC MICROANGIOPATHY, SEE NOTE.2.SEVERE INTERSTITIAL 
FIBROSIS AND TUBULAR ATROPHY.
Note: The biopsy shows striking acute and chronic thrombotic 
microangiopathy involving arterioles and glomeruli.  The biopsy 
also shows advanced scarring of the tubulointerstitial 
compartment (70-80% of the cortical area).

Imaging:
CT abd/pelvis ___
 
IMPRESSION: 
  
1.No wall thickening or pneumatosis concerning for colitis.    
  
2.Small amount of non-hemorrhagic intraperitoneal fluid. 

MRI C spine ___
IMPRESSION:  No cord compression or abnormal enhancement within 
the spinal canal.  Mild-to-moderate degenerative changes. 

MRI Head ___
IMPRESSION:  No acute infarcts, mass effect, hydrocephalus or 
abnormal 
enhancement.  Mild changes of small vessel disease.  Mucosal 
thickening left maxillary sinus and soft tissue changes in 
bilateral mastoids.

Renal US:
IMPRESSION: 
  
1. No evidence of hydronephrosis, stones, or focal renal 
lesions. 
2. Ascites. 

CT Chest ___
IMPRESSION: 
  
1.  Scattered small ground-glass and ___ opacities in 
the upper lobes could represent atypical infection, as 
suspected, or inflammation. 
  
2.  4 mm right upper lobe nodule is new since ___ 
and likely also infectious or inflammatory; this may be 
reassessed for resolution on follow-up imaging. 
  
3.  Hyperdense liver and spleen, similar to prior, likely due to 

hemosiderosis.  
  

Right lower extremity venous ultrasound ___:
Partial thrombus in the proximal right superficial femoral vein 
is relatively unchanged compared to the prior examination 
without evidence of DVT progression.   

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is ___ with accelerated CML s/p allo transplant 
___ complicated by GVHD, pneumonia, myositis, and DVTs who 
initially presented with fatigue, diarrhea, pancytopenia in the 
setting of Cellcept and Ponatinib therapy.

# Diarrhea: Patient presented with 4 weeks of watery diarrhea 
with ___ bowel movements daily and poor appetite. Symptoms were 
most likely secondary to cellcept toxcity or ponatinib toxicity. 
Colon biopsy results were consisted with shallow crypts that are 
typically seen with GVHD or cellcept toxicity. While GVHD is a 
possible etiolgy, chronic GVHD is much less likely to present 
with acute diarrhea. An extensive infectious work up including 
norovirus, CMV, cdiff, adenovirus, parvovirus, HHV6, and O&P 
were negative. Ms. ___ improved with decreased cellcept 
dosing. She was transitioned from 1000mg BID to ___ BID at 
time of discharge. She continues to have ___ loose bowel 
movements daily. However, she continues to trend in a positive 
direction at the time of discharge. She did require 2 weeks of 
TPN but is now tolerating a PO diet at the time of discharge.

# Pancytopenia: Pt was noted to have progressive pancytopenia on 
outpatient labs over weeks preceeding admission. Pancytopenia is 
thought to be secondary to ponatinib toxicity as all cell lines 
improved after holding drug. Ms. ___ has experienced 
pancytopenia on previous TKI treatments as well. She was also 
transitioned from bactrim to atovaquone for PCP ___. A 
bone morrow biopsy was hypocellular but without concern for 
recurrent CML. A Graft chimerism study notable for 100% donor. 
Pt did also have HSV oral lesion and there may have been a 
component of HSV marrow suppression as her counts also improved 
with acyclovir therapy. Ponatinib is held at the time of 
discharge.

# Nephrotic syndrome:  The patient presented with acute on 
chronic CKD with creatinine around 2 this admission. Her 
creatinine has been gradually uptrending over the last year. It 
was never worked up and thought to be secondary to TKI therapy. 
She was found to have 4+ proteinuria this admission with low 
serum albumin and elevated triglycerides. A  renal biopsy was 
notable for acute on chronic microangiopathic disease, 
glomerular sclerosing and fibrosis of kidney. Etiology of 
changes remains unclear but differential is broad including 
effects of TKI treatment. There was no hydro or obtruction on 
renal us. Complement levels were normal and no serum 
cyroglobins. She was started on losartan 100mg daily and 
lisinopril 5mg for proteinuria. Pt was also started on aggresive 
IV diuresis for anasarca with improvement in fluid status. She 
will be discharged on 40mg PO Lasix with goal of maintaining 
within 2kg of her discharge weight, which was 143.6 lbs. 
Creatinine was stable around 2 at time of discharge. 

#Dyspnea: Patient promoted dyspnea during admission but never 
developed hypoxia. Symptoms were initially thought to be 
secondary to pulmonary edema and did improve with initial 
diuresis. However, symptoms did not completely resolve. A CT 
Chest was notable for some scattered ground glass opacities and 
a 4 mm right upper lobe nodule. PFTS show mixed obstructive and 
restrictive physiology. Fungal work up unrevealing. Pulmonology 
recommended a course of azithromycin for atypical pneumonia with 
follow up CT scan in 1 month. Dyspnea continued to improve at 
time of discharge following course of azithromycin. She was also 
started on pulmonary prophylaxis with FAM: daily fluticasone, 
azithromycin 3x/wk, monteleukast every other day.

#R lower extremity pain: Pt noted to have partial DVT of right 
superficial femoral vein which is unchanged from prev study in 
___ and most likely represents remnent from previous distal 
DVT which were treated with 6 months of anticoagulation. 
Vascular surg evaluated vascular appearing lesion on right lower 
extreity and are uncertain regarding etiology. ___ be secondary 
to smaller superficial thrombi in smaller leg veins. Recommend 
continued warm compresses, compression,and elevation of leg. 
Further anticoagulation at prophylactic dosing should be 
discussed as an outpatient once platlets are stable.

# Seizure like activity: Pt has 3 episodes of right neck 
twitching and mental status changes on ___ which appeared 
seizure like to staff. There was no tongue biting or generalized 
activity. An MRI Head was normal and LP without concern for 
bacterial infection. Viral cultures were all negative from CSF. 
An EEG was notable for encephalopathy without epileptical 
discharges. Pt experienced no further concerning neurologic 
changes following ___.

# HSV:Pt promoted oral pain on admission and was found to have 
several ulcerative lesions. An oral swab of lesions was positive 
for HSV. Symptoms and ulcers improved on acyclovir. She will 
continue prophylactic dosing as an outpatient.

#CML: Ms. ___ is status ___ allogenic transplant in ___ 
with recurrent disease in late ___. Disease has currently been 
well controlled on ponatinib with BCR-ABL PCR .09. However,has 
now been discontinued as drug toxicity outweighing benefits of 
treatment. As noted above, repeat bone marrow bx this admission 
without concern for recurrent disease. Chimerism study showed 
100% donor.

# GVHD: Has had GI  and skin involvement in past in addition to 
myositis. Has been well controlled on current MMF and prednisone 
dosing. While there was initial concern for GVHD as etiology to 
current presentation, it is uncommon to have diarrhea with 
chronic GVHD. Cellcept and prednisone doses were decreased this 
admission. She will need to closely monitor with recent decrease 
in immunosuppresion. 

#HTN: Ms. ___ had poorly controlled hypertension this 
admission. Most likely related to pregressive kidney disease. 
She was started on losartan, which was uptitrated to 100mg with 
good BP control by discharge.

#Hypogammablobulinemia: Likely ___ nephrotic syndrome and 
protein wasting. At admission, IgG level was 82 and she received 
an IVIg transfusion at 0.4g/kg. On ___, she received a second 
IVIg transfusion at the same dose for an IGg level of 300. 
During the second transfusion, she had some mild upper back pain 
and chills, which resolved with slowing the infusion.

___ Mycoplasma negative
___ BK Virus negative
___ stool cultures negative
___ CMV PCR negative
___ BCR/ABL gene rearrangement 2.013

IMAGING:
EGD ___ Normal
Flex Sig ___ Normal

Renal US ___
Tiny echogenic focus noted in the left kidney, perhaps a small 
AML or a calcified lesion unlikely to be of clinical 
consequence, but otherwise normal renal ultrasound. 

CT Sinus ___
Mucosal thickening in the maxillary sinuses, worse on the left.  
Opacification of the right sphenoid sinus.  Small polyps in the 
right posterior middle nasal turbinate and right pharynx.  The 
ostiomeatal units are patent. 

Gastric Empyting Study ___
IMPRESSION: Rapid gastric emptying. Note that the patient did 
not consume the full standard meal, making these findings 
difficult to interpret. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o F with hx of accelerated phase CML s/p sibling allo D0 
___ presenting with diarrhea x 4 days and nausea/decreased 
PO intake w/ weight loss over the past 1 month.  

# CML
CML s/p sibling allo D0 ___ complicated by GVHD.  No longer 
on TKI given multiple side effects.  Previous chimerism and 
BCR-ABL gene rearrangement study shows no residual disease 
however repeat test showed increased level of BCR-ABL gene.  
Here mycophenylate was stoooped to increase graft versus. 
leukemia effect.  We continued her current prednisone regiemtn 
15mg alternating with 20mg.  Her acyclovir and atovaquone were 
continued. 

# Nausea/Weight Loss
History of 1 month of worsening nausea and decreased PO intake 
correlated with 5 pound weight loss.  Concern for upper GI GVHD 
given decrease in steroids and nausea.  EGD and flex sig 
negative for signs of GVHD.  Her gastric empyting study was 
inconclusive.  Her symptoms improved with zyprexa and zofran.  
She was able to tolerate a diet at time of discharge and her 
symptoms were well-controlled.
 
# Sinus Congestion
Concern for sinus infection given symptoms and immunocompromised 
state.  CT sinus shows mucosal thickening w/o bone involvement.  
She was started on levofloxacin for a total of 14 days of 
treatment.  Her symptoms were imporved with afrin, flonase, and 
saline irrigation.  She will follow-up in ___ clinic in 1 month.

# Diarrhea
Presents with diarrhea x4 days and overnight had more non-bloody 
watery diearrhea.  Most likely secondary to viral or bacterial 
gastroenteritis.  However could be due to GVHD and recent 
decrease in prednisone dosing. Also could be medication side 
effects from mycophenylate.  On previous admission, had diarrhea 
and her mycophenylate dose was decreasd with improvement in his 
symptoms.  Her TKI was also disconinued during this admission.  
Diarrhea has been improving and flex sig was without signs of 
GVHD.  Stool studies were negative for infection.  On discharge 
her diarrhea had resolved.
 
# Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis 
Elevated bicarb w/ hypercholemia most likely due to combination 
of chronic kidney diease, diarrhea, and NS fluids.  We started 
oral bicarb replacement and her serum bicarb level normalized at 
time of discharge.

# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure
Elevated Cr to 2.6 from baseline 1.9-2.3 likely pre-renal 
etiology secondary to diarrhea and poor PO intake.  Also could

IMAGING
-------
TTE ___
IMPRESSION: Hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function. No 
clinically significant valvular regurgitation or stenosis. 
Indeterminate pulmonary artery systolic pressure. Suggestion of 
pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.  Compared with the 
prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the left ventricular 
systolic function is now hyperdynamic (LVEF previously 55-60%). 

Pharmacological Stress MIBI ___
INTERPRETATION: Left ventricular cavity size is normal.  Rest 
and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake 
throughout the left ventricular myocardium.  Gated images reveal 
normal wall motion. Septal wall motion compatible with prior 
CABG.  The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 65% 
post stress.
IMPRESSION: Normal myocardial perfusion study.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis ___
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of PTLD.  
2. Soft tissue nodules in the left lower quadrant most likely 
represent the sequela of subcutaneous injections.

CT Chest ___
IMPRESSION:
1. As compared to ___, no lung nodules have newly 
appeared.  The
pre-existing lung nodules, including the minimal ground-glass 
nodules in the upper lobe, are all constant, unsuspicious in 
morphology.  If the patient is not at high risk for cancer, the 
lesions do not require further followup, given that their 
dimension is below 4 mm.
2.  Status post CABG, no lymphadenopathy, no pleural effusions.

CXR ___
ET tube is in a standard position.  NG tube tip is out of view 
below the 
diaphragm.  Cardiomegaly is stable.  Increasing opacities in the 
right 
perihilar region and right lower lobe are worrisome for 
worsening pneumonia.  Component of pulmonary edema is stable.  
Left lower lobe pneumonia is stable.  There is no pneumothorax 
or large pleural effusion.  There are low lung volumes with 
stable widened mediastinum  due to engorgement of vessels. 

CXR ___:
The patient is currently not intubated.  The right internal 
jugular line tip is at the right atrium and should be pulled 
back approximately 3 cm.  Heart size and mediastinum are stable. 
 Lungs are essentially clear.  No pleural effusion or 
pneumothorax is appreciated, although cannot be entirely 
excluded. 

Muscle Biopsy ___:  Final Report Pending

CT Chest Without Contrast ___:  Newly appeared massive 
bilateral opacities, predominantly ground-glass in attenuation, 
with subtle areas of consolidation.  Accompanying airways 
disease and small pleural effusions with atelectasis. 

EMG ___:  Abnormal study. There is electrophysiologic 
evidence for a moderate, generalized myopathic process with 
denervating features. In addition, the data are suggestive of a 
moderate, generalized, axonal, sensorimotor polyneuropathy. 
Based on the limited repetitive stimulation studies performed, 
there is no evidence for a disorder of neuromuscular junction 
transmission, including myasthenia ___. Compared to the 
previous study dated ___, there has been an improvement 
in motor response amplitudes and worsening in sensory response 
amplitudes.  

 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  

Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o F with history of accelerated phase CML 
s/p sibling allo transplant on ___ complicated by upper and 
lower GI GVHD ___, liver GVHD in setting of reducing 
immunosuppression ___, GVHD related myopathy resulting in 
weakness and respiratory failure ___ who presented for 
presyncope. Her lightheadedness improved significantly with IV 
fluids and she had no further episodes of presyncope. She had 
elevated creatinine above baseline that resolved with IV fluids. 
She was found to have an elevated troponin that trended down 
thought to be likely due to demand ischemia in the setting of 
anemia in addition to poor clearance in the setting of acute on 
chronic kidney injury. Her BCR-ABL load was elevated compared to 
prior levels and her prednisone immunosuppression was decreased 
to improve control of her CML. She was also found to have an 
elevated EBV viral load with concern for PTLD/lymphoma and had a 
CT Torso which showed no evidence of PTLD. She received 1 dose 
of rituximab on ___ and tolerated well.

On reduction of the pt.'s prednisone, she developed severe 
myalgias and respiratory distress thought to be ___ muscle 
weakness, hypervolemia, and flash pulmonary edema with BPs in 
220s/110s. She was transferred to the ICU, required intubation, 
and was diuresed.  She was extubated and her respiratory status 
returned to baseline. She was found to have both a new 
consolidation on CXR evaluated by both the pulmonary service and 
infectious disease service who both recommended a course of 
antibiosis for HCAP. She also had an elevated troponin during 
this episode. Cardiology evaluated pt and determined her to have 
an NSTEMI in the setting of elevated troponin and new focal wall 
motion abnormality on echocardiogram. She continued to have 
myalgias and had a muscle biopsy and EMG to better assess the 
cause of her myalgias. ___ results indicate no signs of 
active GVHD or GVHD myasthenia ___. Final results are 
pending. She remained hemodynamically stable and was discharged 
to rehab on her admission dose of prednisone.
 
ACTIVE ISSUES

# Acute Myalgias and Muscle Weakness:  On admission, pt. reports 
diffuse muscle weakness and myalgias.  Following reduction of 
prednisone from alternating 15mg/20mg daily, pt. had significant 
worsening of symptoms.  CK was mildly elevated.  For concern of 
worsening symptoms ___ to ongoing levofloxacin (has been 
associated with increased risk of tenosynovitis in pt.'s on 
chronic steroids), this medication was discontinued.  An EMG was 
done showing no evidence of GVHD induced myasthenia ___.  
___ muscle biopsy performed on ___ of the left biceps 
femoris biopsy returned negative for any evidence of 
inflammation.  The most likely etiology of the patient's 
symptoms were thought to be ___ profound deconditioning with a 
possible component of steroid induced myopathic fibroatrophy 
given ongoing steroids over the last ___ years.  GVHD less likely 
given no evidence of myositis on ___ path, although pt.'s 
physical exam is somewhat consistent with chronic GVHD. 

# Respiratory Failure:  Following reduction of patient's 
steroids, pt. developed profound muscle weakness.  In this 
setting, she became hypoxic and later hypertensive with BPs in 
220s/110s.  She had a presumed episode of flash pulmonary edema 
which resulted in her transfer to the ICU and subsequent 
intubation.  Pt. was diuresed significantly and extubated 
without issue.  She was thought to be volume overloaded 
secondary to initial resuscitation following her pre-syncopal 
presentation.  Pt. continued to respond well to diuresis and was 
transferred back to the medical floor.

# Hospital Acquired Pneumonia:  Pt. had a new consolidation on 
CXR on this admission.  Started on HCAP coverage with 
vanc/meropenem.  The patient initially responded well and was 
d/c'ed off vanc.  Given concern for worsening pneumonia and 
respiratory distress, pulmonary was consulted for possible 
bronchoscopy.  ___ then recommended cardiology evaluation given 
ongoing elevated troponin and question of ischemic changes seen 
on TTE and EKG.  ID also saw pt. and recommended continuation of 
levofloxacin for total of 5 day course for atypical coverage and 
meropenem for total of 8 day course.  For concern that 
levofloxacin was contributing to pt.'s myalgias/ tendonitis, pt. 
was discontinued 1 day earlier than completion of full course.  
At time of discharge, pt. had ongoing improving cough.  She had 
a repeat CXR (___) negative for consolidation or pulmonary 
edema.  

# NSTEMI:  In the setting of episode of flash pulmonary edema, 
pt. had an elevated troponin.  Cardiology evaluated the patient 
who recommended a repeat TTE which revealed showed decrease in 
EF to 40% and akinesis of the anteroseptal wall.  Given her 
known CAD, this was thought to most likely be related to either 
a type 1 primary coronary event or type 2 demand ischemia in the 
setting of recent hypertensive emergency and flash pulmonary 
edema.  Given that pt. was a poor cath candidate with ongoing 
acute on chronic kidney injury, will proceed with medical 
optimization at this time.  As such, pt. was discharged on ASA 
81mg Daily, metoprolol and amlodipine for afterload reduction.  
A statin was held at this time given ongoing myalgias.  Her 
losartan was held for resolving acute on chronic kidney injury.  


# Admission Troponin elevation:  Pt. had admission Troponin peak 
at 1.07, CK-MB 11. Patient did not have chest pain at this time, 
but did report dizziness and dyspnea which may be her anginal 
equivalent. ECG on admission was not suggestive of ischemia.  
Pt. evaluated for ACS but noted to have downtrending trops in 
setting of resolving anemia and resolving acute on chronic 
kidney injury.  Initial TTE showed hyperdynamic function 
consistent with her volume depleted status.  In the setting of 
known CAD, pt. also had a persantine stress MIBI which was 
negative for evidence of malperfusion/ischemia.  Likely cause of 
admission troponin elevation was thought to be due to demand 
ischemia in the setting of anemia in addition to poor clearance 
in the setting of acute on chronic kidney injury.  

# Poor appetite:  Patient not taking good PO at home. Signs of 
anasarca on exam with diffuse dependent edema.  Pt. states that 
she is eating more on this hospitalization compared to any other 
time recently.  Denies nausea/vomiting, abdominal symptoms, 
diarrhea.  Pt. was started on marinol for appetite stimulation 
but developed excess sedation.  This medication was 
discontinued. 

# Anemia:  On admission, pt. found to have Hct drop from 27 to 
19.  She received fluids in clinic of unknown quantity.  No 
history of bleeding.  Anemia work-up was negative for hemolysis 
with normal TSH level.  Pt. did have a retic count which was low 
given the level of anemia consistent with decreased production 
likely ___ pt's CML.  Her Hct remained stable after initial 
transfusion throughout the remainder of admission.

# Presyncope/lightheadedness:  Pt. presented with orthostatic 
hypotension in the setting of poor PO intake and ongoing 
antihypertensive/diuretic therapy making hypovolemia the most 
likely etiology. Given troponin elevation, considered cardiac 
etiology however stress MIBI negative.  Her lightheadedness 
resolved after giving IV fluids.  Her home furosemide and 
amlodipine were discontinued.  The patient was discharged on a 
reduced hypertensive regimen as described in transitional 
issues. 

# Acute on chronic kidney injury:  On admission, pt. was found 
to have creatinine elevated to 2.6 from baseline of 1.5 to 2.0.  
Likely pre-renal given hypovolemia with orthostasis.  She 
received IV fluids and her creatinine returned to baseline.  Pt. 
then had second episode of acute on chronic kidney injury ___ 
poor forward flow in the setting of flash pulmonary edema and 
NSTEMI.  Her renal function returned to baseline with diuresis.  
She was noted to have an elevated uric acid at this time which 
dramatically decreased following one dose of rasburicase. 

# CML
Accelerated phase CML s/p sibling allo D0 ___ now relapsed 
CML.  BCR-ABL returned slightly elevated compared to prior.  We 
continued prophylaxis on home acyclovir, atovaquone, fluconazole 
at renal dosing.  Her prednisone was attempted to be reduced to 
15mg daily to improve control of CML with evidence of increasing 
BCR-ABL.  The pt. did not tolerate this as above.  She has a 
repeat BCR ABL and kinase domain mutation pending.  TKI should 
be considered as an outpatient.

# Elevated EBV Viral Load
EBV was elevated on last admission and more elevated on this 
admission.  HHV6/Parvo B19 negative.  For concern of 
PTLD/lymphoma, pt. was evaluated with CT Torso which showed no 
evidence of PTLD.  Pt. given 1 dose of rituximab on ___ and 
tolerated it well.  

# Sinusitis 
Pt. received course of levofloxacin with resolution of symptoms.

CHRONIC ISSUES
# Hypertension:  Stable.  Continued altered regimen as described 
above.

# Hyperlipidemia
Stable.  Not currently on therapy at this time

# Coronary artery disease 
Stable.  Will continue home aspirin and antihypertensives as 
above.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:

1. Heme/Onc Follow-Up: Pt. requires follow-up with Dr. ___ on 
___ and ___. 

2. NSTEMI Follow-Up: Pt. requires follow-up with cardiology in 
___ weeks from discharge. She also should have a repeat TTE 
shortly prior to this visit. She has an appt. with cardiology on 
___.

3. Lab Work: Pt. does have chronic anemia and thrombocytopenia 
secondary to her CML. Pt. should receive labs every other day 
(CBC with diff, Chem 10, ALT, AST, Alk Phos, TBili, LDH, ___, 
PTT, INR) while at rehab. Lab results should be faxed to Dr. 
___ office at ___.

4. Hypertension Regimen: Pt. presented with orthostasis thought 
to be ___ both poor PO intake and strict blood pressure control. 
She also had an NSTEMI while hospitalized. Pt. was discontinued 
off of her daily losartan for ongoing renal dysfunction. 
Metoprolol XL was reduced to 250mg Daily from 300mg Daily. She 
was continued on amlodipine 5mg PO Daily. Furosemide was 
continued at 20mg PO Daily. Pt's standing weight at discharge 
was 139 lbs. Pt's medications should be titrated appropriately 
to HR and BP. Her losartan should also be restarted if possible 
if close monitoring is available, in place of amlodipine if 
amlodipine if not needed for blood pressure control.

5. Immunosuppression and steroid taper: Pt. was unable to 
tolerate prednisone taper as she had significant exacerbation of 
myopathy and muscle weakness. As such, she was continued on her 
admission dose of alternating daily doses of prednisone 
15mg/20mg. If attempting to reduce prednisone in future, please 
reduce on slow taper, consider ___ / week as tolerated and 
closely monitor symptoms. 

6. Poor Nutrition: Pt. has mild anasarca likely in part due to 
poor nutrition partially caused by decreased appetite and 
nausea. Pt. was started on dronabinol to improve these symptoms, 
however she became sedated. This medication was not continued at 
discharge. She was continued on furosemide prn for management of 
fluid volume.

7. Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor: Given increase CML disease 
activity, possible use of TKI should be discussed with Dr. 
___. Ponatinib has been associated with increased incidence 
of cardiac events and should be avoided in this pt. with known 
CAD and now recent NSTEMI. Desatinib may be a better option but 
was not initiated at time of discharge. Consider slow 
uptitration of dosage starting at 20mg as pt. tolerates.

8. Levofloxacin: Pt. was discontinued off of levofloxacin as 
this medication was associated with worsening myalgias in this 
pt. Please avoid fluoroquinolone class if possible as this seems 
to worsen her myalgias. There also is a high risk of 
tenosynovitis with these abx. in pt.'s on chronic steroids. 

9. Statin: Given pt's known CAD and NSTEMI on this admission, 
pt. would benefit from a statin. Pt. was not initiated on this 
hospitalization given myalgias.

10. Steroids and Osteopenia: Pt. had a bone scan in ___ 
revealing osteopenia. Given her chronic steroid use, please 
consider every ___ month bone scans.

11. Access Issues: Vascular access and lab draws have been a 
challenge as an inpatient. Additionally, pt. has coagulopathy 
likely ___ chronic steroid use resulting in diffuse ecchymosis 
from minimal skin injury. Given upcoming treatments and likely 
multiple hospitalizations, pt. may benefit from Port vs. PICC 
placement.

12. Pulm Follow-Up: Pt. was evaluated by the pulmonary consult 
team who recommended repeat chest CT 4 weeks from ___ to 
evaluate for resolution of pneumonia. If pt. has new symptoms, 
chest CT should be considered prior to this time. If resolution, 
no pulmonary follow-up is necessary. This can be coordinated 
with Dr. ___. 

13. Pending Labs: Pt. has BCR ABL and Domain Kinase mutation lab 
pending. This should be follow-up by Dr. ___.

14. Uric Acid: Pt. had elevated uric acid level on admission. We 
did not start allopurinol at this time given resolving kidney 
dysfunction. Consider starting allopurinol as an outpatient.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___.  You were admitted to the hospital 
because you felt as though you were going to faint and were not 
eating or drinking well.  You received fluids through your IV 
and your lightheadedness improved.  You also had worsening 
kidney function likely due initially to poor oral intake and 
later to heart dysfunction.  Your heart enzymes were found to be 
elevated both on admission and during your hospitalization.  The 
ultrasound of your heart initially was normal as well as a 
stress test.  A repeat ultrasound did show some wall damage 
indicating that you most likely had a small heart attack.  
Additionally, your EBV virus level was high.  You received one 
dose of rituximab to treat the EBV virus.

You prednisone dose was decreased to help improve control of 
your CML.  However, you developed worsening muscle pain and 
required help breathing with an airway tube in the Intensive 
Care Unit.  We removed excess fluid which improved your 
breathing.  You were also found to have a pneumonia at this time 
which was treated with antibiotics.  We obtained a muscle biopsy 
and an EMG to better assess your muscle pain.  These tests are 
currently pending.  Your condition improved and you were 
discharged with close follow-up.

All the best,

Your ___ Team

GVHD, liver GVHD, GVHD related myopathy, who presented from ___ 
clinic for lab abnormalities including hyperkalemia (5.4), 
elevated uric acid (11.5) and acute renal failure (2.3) and was 
found to have a DVT in left ___.  

#DVT in Lt ___: Based on ___ done on ___, DVT seems to be 
chronic and decreasing in size. Based on repeat ___ on ___, 
there is evidence of a new DVT in Lt superficial femoral vein 
that was not visualized on previous study. On presentation, pt 
had scute worsening of ___ edema, prompting us to do further 
imaging. Pt was initially started on heparin gtt with goal PTT 
50-80. However, given high risk of bleeding and current severe 
bruising, we transitioned to heparin SC 12500U BID. We will 
discharge pt on heparin SC 12500U BID for ___ months in 
discretion of outpatient oncologist, Dr. ___. 
- continue heparin SC 12500U BID for ___ months
- hold aspirin 81mg 

#chronic kidney failure: Cr 2.2 on discharge; baseline 1.5-2.0. 
Creatinine ranged 1.8-2.3 during hospitalization. Most likely 
prerenal in the setting of poor po intake; however, elevated 
uric acid may be contributing as well. 
. Throughout hospitalization, she received 1L of fluid and only 
upon admission. We encouraged oral intake and pt was compliant 
with plan. Given history of chronic kidney diseae and 
microangiopathic injury, small daily changes in the Cr are not 
clinically significant. ___ on presentation most likely prerenal 
given improvement with hydration. Based on renal biopsy done in 
___, there is thrombotic microangiopathic injury and severe 
intersitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. These changes may be 
due to TKI. We held lasix and discontinued it on discharge. 
Resuming lasix will be in discretion of PCP ___ Dr. ___. 
Please encourage oral intake. Please renally dose all 
medications and monitor pt's I/O's and weight. If Cr. rises, pt 
can be given IVF conservatively since new TTE showed EF 55%.  

#CML: Progression of pt's CML was not addressed during this 
hospitalization. This will be assessed as outpatient with Dr. 
___. Last BCR/AML checked on ___ and increasing. Pt p/w 
hyperuricemia and thrombocytopenia, which may be indicating 
changes in leukemia and rapid cell turn over. We tapered 
prednisone by 1mg every other day and stopped at 10mg daily. 
This is the dose we recommend on discharge. Changes can be made 
in discretion of Dr. ___. 

#Hyperuricemia: Urice acid on presentation 11.4. Pt was treated 
with one dose of rasburicase 6mg IV and was further placed on 
allopurinol ___ daily. However, repeat urice acid on ___ was 
8.7. Given that pt has CKD and is already on optimal dose of 
allopurinol ___ daily. We added Febuxostat 40 mg PO daily on 
___ and recommend continuing allopurinol for one week after 
discharge, last dose on ___. 
The exact cause of elevated uric acid is unknown. It may be due 
to rapid cell turnover and changes in CML. Pt will be follow up 
with Dr. ___ further assessment. We recommend checking 
uric acid level in one week. Elevated uric acid may be 
contributing to poor kidney function. 

#Thrombocytopenia: Plt count fluctuated through hospital course. 
This (in addition to hyperuricemia) may present rapid cell 
turnover and changes in leukemia. We discontinued aspirin on 
discharge and held it throughout hospitalization. We recommend 
monitoring plt count as outpatient. 

#Myopathy: Muscle biopsy official report showed no evidence of 
myositit but abnormal muscle fibers. Exact etiology is unclear 
but GVHD and possibly steroids likely. We tapered steroids and 
discharged pt on prednisone 10mg daily.  

#Cough: Most likely viral and post-infectious. Improving but 
intermittent in nature. It has been going on for a few weeks and 
since last admission. CT chest/sinuses negative for any acute 
infectious processes. CT-chest (done twice on ___ and ___ 
showed improvement of opacities observed in ___. Pulmonary 
was consulted and concluded no indication for bronchoscopy given 
improvement in imaging. They concluded post-infectious cough as 
most likely etiology and recommended atroven neb. Given the 
setting of new DVT, there was concern for PE. Pt was tachycardic 
but no dyspnea or pleuritic chest pain. V/Q was negative for PE 
on ___. B-glucan was positive on ___ but repeat on ___ was 
negative. Galactomannan was negative. 

#CAD s/p CABG: History of NSTEMI on last admission is 
questionable since pt only had a trop leak but no EKG changes or 
chest pain. TTE done on ___ showed improved EF 55% (compared to 
40% on last admission). Trops are elevated but seem to be 
chronic and due to CKD. EKG with no acute ischemic changes. We 
held ASA during hospitalization and discontinued on discharge 
since pt is on heparin, she presented with severe bruising, and 
she continued have thrombocytopenia. 

#Hypertension: We continued metoprolol 250mg and amlodipine 5mg.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you here at the ___ 
___. 

You presented to us with laboratory abnormalities most likely 
due to acute kidney injury and dehydration. We treated you with 
IV fluids and following adequate hydration, these laboratory 
abnormalities resolved and your kidney function improved. In 
addition, your uric acid was very high on admission and you were 
given medications to lower the level since it can cause damage 
to your kidneys. You are being discharged on new medications, 
called allopurinol and febuxostat to maintain low uric acid 
levels. Allopurinol will be discontinued in one week, ___. It 
is important to mention that given your history of chronic 
kidney disease, small daily changes in your kidney function are 
not of clinical significance and can be managed by IV fluids. We 
encourage you to drink plenty of water everyday. 

You were also found to have a blood clot in your left leg. You 
are being treated with heparin injections twice a day. We also 
lowered your steroid dosage gradually and stopped at prednisone 
10mg daily. 

Please take your medications as instructed. Please attend all 
your follow up appointments. Please follow up with Dr. ___ in 
clinic on ___ as scheduled.

IMAGING:
___ CT CHEST W/O CON
IMPRESSION: 
1.  New small foci of ground-glass opacities in the upper lobes, 
larger on the 
left, are worrisome for infection. 
2.  Stable splenomegaly. 
3.  Dense coronary calcifications. 
4.  New small left effusion. 
5.  Stable enlargement of the main pulmonary arteries suggesting 
pulmonary 
hypertension. 

___ LLE DUPLEX U/S
IMPRESSION: 
  
Chronic, non-occlusive thrombus of the left proximal superficial 
femoral vein, 
unchanged since ___.   

___ CXR (PORT)
REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with CML 
transformation into AML and blast crisis with persistent cough. 
Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison 
to ___. 
The right central venous line tip is at the cavoatrial 
junction/proximal right atrium.  Heart size and mediastinum are 
stable.  There is new left 
retrocardiac opacity, not seen on the prior study, concerning 
for left lower lobe pneumonia associated with small amount of 
pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen. 

___ TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild 
to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with 
near-akinesis of the septum, and hypokinesis of the basal-mid 
anterior wall. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left 
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is 
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The 
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is 
no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most 
likely represents a prominent fat pad. 

IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction 
consistent with LAD ischemia/infarction. Mild mitral 
regurgitation. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___ and 
___, the function of the septum and anterior wall are 
similar (septal function was described as mildly hypokinetic on 
the most recent study but it was severely hypokinetic then 
also). The function of the mid to distal inferior wall has 
improved. Mild mitral regurgitation is seen.  

PATHOLOGY:
___ IMMUNOPHENOTYPING
Increased number of blasts. In a context of patient's known CML, 
this is concerning for acute blast crisis.  Correlation with 
clinical findings and morphology (see separate report 
___ is recommended.  Flow cytometry immunophenotyping 
may not detect all abnormal populations due to topography, 
sampling or artifacts of sample preparation

___ Bone marrow bx
 Chronic Myelogeneous leukemia - Blast phase (CML-BP), see note.
Note: This represents acute myelegenous transformation of the 
patient's
previously diagnosed CML; ie., CML-BP. CD34 and CD117 are 
increased and
highlight blasts occupying estimated 70-80% of the overall 
cellularity.
 CD20 highlights rare B cells.  CD3 stains interstitial T 
lymphocytes.
CD42 is present in the megakaryocytes, which do not appear 
increased.
TdT is negative.  MP0 is not expressed in blasts.  Glycophorin
highlights erythroid precursors, but is negative in the blasts.

___ Skin bx
PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:

Skin, left mid back; punch biopsy:

 - Mild spongiosis with dyskeratosis, patchy interface 
inflammation and
focal intra-epidermal eosinophils,  with superficial 
perivascular
mononuclear cell infiltrate and dermal eosinophils (see 
comment).
 - No fungal organisms identified on a PAS stain.
 - Multiple tissue levels examined.

Comment:  The histologic differential diagnosis includes both a
hypersensitivity reaction and graft versus host disease. The 
presence
of eosinophils is compatible with the clinical suspicion of a 
drug
eruption, although they do not exclude graft versus host 
disease.
Clinical correlation is recommended.

 

 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with CML s/p sibling allo D0 ___, complicated by chronic 
GVHD with gut, liver, muscle involvement presenting from ___ 
clinic with hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, hypercalcemia, ___ on 
CKD and pancytopenia, now with conversion to AML.
 
#CML/AML: BCR/ABL trended up from 0 to 2 to 5 to 104 to 162. 
Presented with hyperuricemia and pancytopenia likely due to 
conversion to AML and rapid cell turn over. No evidence of 
bleeding. Hemolysis unlikely with normal coag studies and Tbili. 
 Retic count 1.8 with retic index 0.88% showed poor red cell 
production. CMV/EBV/HHV6 negative. BM bx shows conversion to AML 
with as much as 65% blasts on smear with absolute blast count as 
high as 1200 and 0% neutrophils. Treated with 12 days of 
nilotinib with no improvement. Given continued decline and poor 
prognosis, transitioned to comfort measures only after which she 
expired. 

#Cough/HCAP: Patient had intermittently productive cough for ___ 
weeks with negative workup on last admission including CXR, CT 
Chest, V/Q scan, rapid resp viral panel. Clear lung exam, 
negative CXR at rehab prior to admission. RRV panel and cx, 
beta-glucan, galactomannan negative. BNP >40K so volume overload 
potentially played a partial role especially given LVEF 40-45% 
on TTE. PE unlikely as patient not hypoxic, no evidence of right 
heart strain on EKG, no evidence of infarct on CT Chest; 
regardless, anticoagulation held in setting of thrombocytopenia 
and no hemodynamic compromise. CT showed ?infectious process, in 
the setting of worsening cough/resp status portable CXR showed 
likely LLL PNA. On ___ patient met ___ SIRS criteria 
(tachycardic, tachypneic, low WBC) so cx drawn and started on 
empiric vanc/meropenem. Received benzonatate, codeine, 
guaifenesin-dextromethorphan as well as levalbuterol/ipratropium 
nebs prn for symptomatic relief. With continued worsening 
respiratory status patient started on morphine for SOB O2 
supplementation prn. Given prognosis, she was transitioned to 
comfort measures only with withdrawal of abx, scopalamine patch, 
and morphine gtt, on which she expired. 

#Hypercalcemia: Baseline high 8s-9s, on admission 10.7. Unclear 
etiology, given elevated alk phos in the setting of CKD could 
have increased bony release of calcium though increased bone 
turnover would likely cause a higher phosphate level. PTH 6 
which rules out hyperparathyroidism and makes hypercalcemia in 
the setting of worsening CML more likely especially with Vit D 
wnl but PTHrP elevated. Received IVF, furosemide, ___ dose 
pamidronate ___ and calcitonin ___ while calcium 
carbonate/Vit D held and calcium downtrended to 8.4.

#UTI: Found to have citrobacter/klebsiella UTI on culture taken 
after patient began to appear septic with ___ SIRS signs. 
Infection was covered by meropenem rx'ed for putative PNA. Foley 
catheter was left in place for comfort and abx discontinued when 
patient transitioned to comfort measures only. 

#CHF: Patient has known CHF likely of ischemic nature given CAD, 
found to have persistent LVEF 40-45% on TTE ___. Increased 
volume with IVF for hypercalcemia tx led to increasing dyspnea 
treated with oxygen supplementation, which improved after 
diuresis and PNA tx as above. At this point, IVF held as calcium 
dropped and for comfort reasons. 
 
#DVT in LLE: Left superficial femoral vein DVT found on last 
admission, discharged on SQ heparin for tx. Previously presented 
with acute worsening of LLE edema but now reduced compared to 
prior admission. LLE U/S shows unchanged partially occlusive 
clot of proximal superficial femoral vein. Anticoagulation held 
given thrombocytopenia, IVC filter placement held given 
stability of clot and goals of care. 

#Hyperuricemia: Uric acid on presentation 9.5. Pt treated on 
last admission with rasburicase and started on allopurinol and 
febuxostat. Discharged with uric acid 8.7. Febuxostat held on 
this admission due to drug rash. Elevated uric acid possibly due 
to worsening renal function in the setting of hypovolemia but 
given rising BCR-ABL and known CML->AML progression likely due 
to rapid cell turnover. Elevated uric acid unlikely to be 
contributing to poor kidney function given no urate crystals on 
urine sediment. Treated with rasburicase x1, uric acid dropped 
to but rose to 9.6 over several days. Allopurinol discontinued 
after patient transitioned to comfort measures only. 

#CKD: Baseline Cr 1.5-2.0 due to thrombotic microangiopathic 
injury with severe interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy 
possibly related to TKI shown on renal biopsy ___. Cr 2.2 on 
last discharge, presented with Cr 2.9. Most likely prerenal in 
the setting of poor po intake and hypovolemia; elevated uric 
acid unlikely to be causing renal damage after improvement with 
fluids and no urate crystals. Cr worsened to 2.5 after several 
doses of IV lasix. Urine output decreased ___. Further 
diuresis held, no further IVF or intervention to improve kidney 
function after transition to comfort care only. 

#GVHD: Known skin, gut, liver, muscle involvement. Aldolase 
mildly elevated consistent with known muscle disease but 
improved from ___. Rash likely drug related over acute GVHD 
per derm bx. Continued on prednisone 10mg then transitioned to 
4mg IV solumedrol BID given inability to tolerate PO prior to 
discontinuation of steroids given goals of care. 

#CAD s/p CABG: History of ?NSTEMI in past, ___ TTE with 
preserved EF 55%. ASA held due to thrombocytopenia. 

#Nutrition: Patient's weight has fallen from 141 to 127 lbs 
since ___, likely ___ poor PO intake. Copper level wnl, 
B6 low. Supplemented with ensure while taking PO prior to 
transition to comfort care.  

#Hypertension: 
-Stable on metoprolol and amlodipine until transition to comfort 
care at which point both rx dc'ed. 

Patient sadly died overnight ___ with her family 
present after comfort care for about 3 days.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old woman with a history of chronic 
anxiety and dysthymia who is brought to the emergency department 
by EMS due to worsening symptoms of depression, irritability, 
and expressed suicidal ideation. 
  
  
1. LEGAL & SAFETY:  
On admission, the patient signed a conditional voluntary 
agreement (Section 10 & 11) and remained on that level 
throughout their admission. She was also placed on 15 minute 
checks status on admission and remained on that level of 
observation throughout while being unit restricted.
  
  
2. PSYCHIATRIC
#Major Depressive Disorder 
At the time of presentation, the patient had difficulty fully 
describing her current mood state, almost to the point of 
alexithymia. She did endorse recent fatigue, poor sleep, poor 
appetite, anhedonia, decreased motivation, diminished 
concentration, and passive suicidal thoughts. While she denied 
suicidal plan or intent, she did note that she had recently felt 
worried that she may lose control and do something unsafe. 
Collateral from her boyfriend, in addition to patient's 
appraisal of her own functioning, was concerning for recent 
deterioration and heightened irritability and depressed mood. On 
initial exam, she had a restricted affect and made minimal eye 
contact with interviewers. 
  
Her presentation appeared most consistent with major depressive 
disorder, but there was additionally an element of 
trauma-related symptoms contributing to her presentation. 
Patient has a history of sexual assault and also described 
arguments with boyfriend evoking memories from childhood when 
she observed her mother/stepfather arguing. 

She reported previous medication trials of fluoxetine, 
citalopram, and duloxetine which were discontinued either due to 
ineffectiveness or side effects. She was started on Wellbutrin 
XR 150mg daily and Hydroxyzine 25mg BID:PRN anxiety/insomnia. 
She reported feeling jittery, anxious, with racing heart on 
Wellbutrin XR 150mg so was transitioned to Wellbutrin SR 100mg. 
She tolerated this well with no reported side effects. Over the 
course of her admission, she engaged in treatment, including 
individual therapy as well as groups focused on coping. She 
reported improvement in her mood and energy level. She denied 
any suicidal ideation, reporting that she was no longer in a 
dark place. She had a less constricted affect and was brighter 
and more reactive. At the time of discharge, she was 
future-oriented, looking forward to getting back to work. 
  
  
3. MEDICAL
#Chronic pelvic pain: Patient reported intermittent right-sided 
pelvic pain exacerbated by urination, bowel movements, and 
intercourse. She denied heavy or irregular menstrual bleeding 
and stated that she usually does not take anything for the pain, 
as ibuprofen and Tylenol have never seemed to help. Patient has 
had discussions about endometriosis with doctors in the past but 
has never been definitively diagnosed. She reports that her 
symptoms are currently at baseline and tolerable. She declined 
offer for PRN pain medication during this admission.
  
  
4. SUBSTANCE USE: Patient reported intermittent marijuana use.  
She was provided with counseling regarding marijuana use and 
possible negative impact substance use has on her anxiety/mood. 
  
  
5. PSYCHOSOCIAL
#) GROUPS/MILIEU:  
The patient was encouraged to participate in the various groups 
and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit.  The 
patient often attended these groups that focused on teaching 
patients various coping skills.  She was also noted to be social 
with her peers in the milieu and pleasant with staff members. 
  
#) COLLATERAL CONTACTS & FAMILY INVOLVEMENT:
Patient provided verbal permission to contact her outpatient 
therapist ___ ___ and her 
outpatient PCP (Dr. ___ ___. Providers were 
contacted for collateral information and for discharge planning. 
Patient also gave verbal permission to contact her boyfriend  
___ who provided the primary team with 
collateral information.
  

INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, 
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of 
starting Wellbutrin and Hydroxyzine, and risks and benefits of 
possible alternatives, including not taking the medications, 
with this patient.   We discussed the patient's right to decide 
whether to take this medication as well as the importance of the 
patient's actively participating in the treatment and discussing 
any  questions about medications with the treatment team, and I  
answered the patient's questions.  The patient appeared able to 
understand and consented to begin the medication.
  
  
RISK ASSESSMENT
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to herself and/or others based upon 
worsening functioning with passive suicidal ideation, fears of 
losing control and doing something unsafe.  Her static factors 
noted at that time include history of trauma and abuse, chronic 
mental illness, chronic pain (fibromyalgia, myofascial pain 
syndrome, chronic pelvic pain) .  The modifiable risk factors, 
which included lack of outpatient treaters, passive suicidal 
ideation, acute mood episode, and medication noncompliance 
(history of discontinuing several antidepressants due to side 
effects) were also addressed at that time.  The patient engaged 
in individual and group therapy focusing on coping skills during 
her admission; she was also started on Wellbutrin which she 
tolerated well and outpatient follow up was scheduled.  Finally, 
the patient is being discharged with many protective factors, 
including future-oriented thinking, willingness to seek help, 
and sense of responsibility to family.  Overall, based on the 
totality of our assessment at this time, the patient is not at 
an acutely elevated risk of self-harm nor danger to others.

History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ LEFT-handed woman with past
medical history of recurrent neurologic events of unclear
etiology as well as significant anxiety and depression with 
prior
suicide event, who presents today for evaluation of R lower
hemithorax and leg numbness of 1 week and urinary complaints. 
She
noted this coming on fairly quickly but not suddenly, and 
without
an apparent trigger. She has a band-like sensation around her
lower chest on R. She characterizes the bladder problem as a few
episodes inability to hold the urine with large-volume
incontinence. Although some of these occurred without warning, 
at
other times she can sort of feel when her bladder is filling 
""but
only on the left side"", and she has also noticed difficulty
emptying her bladder. She had one small accident involving stool
but has also recently changed her diet and had some looser
stools. She has felt cold, and experienced chills over the last
week too. She does admit to a lot of stress currently due to law
school finals and a recent breakup. She recently re-established
care with a psychotherapist (Dr. ___ at ___. 

The right-sided symptoms and bladder problems are new for the pt
but she has had transient neurological problems before. In ___,
she developed a period of a couple of weeks of great fatigue,
then blurred vision and decreased visual acuity, followed by
decreased sensation and strength in the entire left side of the
body (face, arm, leg). During this time, she had difficulty
attending school, and also lost about 50 lbs but is not sure 
why.
The strength recovered gradually over a couple of years with the
help of OT & ___ but the numbness has persisted, and she 
continues
to have episodes of L hand tremor. She also continues to have
problems with her peripheral vision. An MRI brain reportedly
showed ""MS"" but a spinal tap was ""clear"". She was later told by
another physician that she does not have MS but could have
chronic Lyme disease. She is not sure if she was ever tested for
Lyme. She recalls having target rashes a few times as a child
growing up in ___. She certainly has never been treated for
either CNS Lyme or multiple sclerosis. She was also told that 
she
should see a psychiatrist to treat her problems but felt that
this was dismissing her physical complaints. She recently saw 
Dr.
___ in neurology clinic for a first consultation.

Other neurological symptoms include at least monthly migraines
that are preceded by black lines in her vision, frequent 
episodes
of vertigo, and L-sided sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus
of long standing.

MRI Brain/C-Spine/T-Spine ___: IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. Multiple foci of white matter FLAIR hyperintense signal of 
the subcortical and periventricular as well as pontine white 
matter in a distribution 
compatible with demyelinating process such as multiple 
sclerosis. There are no intracranial enhancing lesions to 
suggest active demyelinating plaque, 
assessment somewhat limited due to significant pulsation 
artifacts. 
No evidence of acute infarct. 
2. T2 hyperintense mildly enhancing foci at the left aspect of 
the cervical cord at C6-7 ___s of the anterior thoracic 
cord at T10-11, suggesting active demyelinating process. 
Additional T2 nonenhancing hyperintense lesion at the C3 level. 
3. Multilevel mild cervical spondylosis as described above with 
foraminal 
narrowing at C4-5, C5-6 levels. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
# R sided numbness and urinary complaints
- Ms. ___ was admitted to neurology.  Metabolic, infectious and 
toxic evaluation did not reveal any significant abnormalities.  
Her neurologic exam showed sensory changes in the right trunk 
and leg, but there was also functional overlay on admission.  
She underwent Brain and C-spine MRI which revealed evidence of 
lesions suggestive of a demyelinating disease, including 2 
active, enhancing lesions at c6-7 and t10-11.  Her sensory 
changes are more likely to be explained by the T10-11 lesion, 
although not completely. Overall, her findings are suggestive of 
an acute flare of a new Multiple Sclerosis diagnosis.  She 
underwent Lumbar puncture in ___ (after unsuccessful attempt on 
floor), which revealed mild WBC elevation of 6 and 10, but was 
otherwise benign.  

She was felt to have likely Multiple sclerosis and was started 
on high dose steroids: Methylprednisone 1g x5 days.  Though she 
continued to have sensory symptoms, she was otherwise doing 
well, ambulatory and felt to be safe for discharge.

Outpatient appointment arranged with Dr. ___ outpatient 
MS management.  Notably, on the day of discharge, ___ CSF 
cultures was growing a single colony of gram positive Cocci.  
This was felt to be a contaminant as neither her clinical 
picture, symptoms or other objective labs support an infectious 
meningeal process.  However, Ms. ___ was informed of this 
Positive CSF culture prior to discharge and was counseled by the 
provider for concerning symptoms including headache, confusion 
or neck stiffness.

# Psychiatry
- Ms. ___ has an extensive history of anxiety and depression.  
While in the hospital, she demonstrated this significantly and 
was very stressed about the entire hospitalization.  She 
endorsed poor social support.  Given clinical concern, she 
briefly had a 1:1 sitter, though she never endorsed SI.  
However, this was discontinued after being evaluated by 
psychiatry.  She was started on Citalopram 20mg PO QD during 
this admission.  Her outpatient PCP ___ was 
contacted and agreed to manage her Citalopram.  She agreed to 
continue to see her psychotherapist on an outpt basis. 
 
Medications on Admission:
1. Ibuprofen 600 mg PO Q8H:PRN pain  
2. eletriptan HBr 20 mg oral as needed for Migraine

Discharge Diagnosis:
1) Demyelinating Disease- New Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis
2) MS flare with sensory symptoms.

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear, coherent, sad affect.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were hospitalized with 1 week of right sided sensory change 
and urinary incontinence.  While in the hospital, you were on 
the neurology service.  To further clarify your symptoms, you 
underwent an MRI of the Brain and the upper spine which revealed 
evidence of ""Demyelinating disease"", most likely multiple 
sclerosis.  Based on the MRI image, there was evidence of an 
""acute flare"" causing your symptoms as well as evidence of 
older, more chronic lesions.

You then underwent a Lumbar Puncture (spinal tap) for evaluation 
of the protein in your spinal fluid.  This labwork was still 
pending at the time of your discharge.

You received 5 days of IV steroids to help speed the resolution 
of your symptoms.  You were doing well and felt to be safe for 
discharge home.  However, it will be critical for you to 
follow-up with Dr. ___ (a multiple sclerosis specialist) for 
future treatment and management of your disease and symptoms.

Before leaving the hospital, your doctor's told you about a 
likely contaminant in your spinal fluid.  One of two of your 
bacterial spinal fluid cultures was growing one colony of 
bacteria.  This is not consistent with your symptoms and your 
doctors ___ not think you have a bacterial infection.  

However, please monitor for neck stiffness, severe unusual 
headache and confusion.  If these symptoms occur, please call 
your doctor or go to the emergency room.

Brief Hospital Course:
Global Assessment:
___ years old female with self reported depression, anxiety, 
multiple prior psychiatric hospitalizations and 1 prior SA, also 
with PMH of multiple sclerosis, L sensorineural hearing loss, 
migraine headaches, and HTN presenting with several 
neurovegetative sx of depression and SI in the setting of 
financial and psychosocial stressors. Etiology of presenting sx 
was unclear as clinical picture was complicated by patient's 
affective lability, hypervigilence, and preoccupation with 
injustice/persecution. Ddx was initially broad, but the pt did 
very well during her stay and appeared to suffer from complex 
PTSD w/ co-morbid depression and personality d/o traits.

#. Complex PTSD / Depression / Personality d/o traits: 
On admission, she reported sx of depression and anxiety, was 
passively suicidal and very irritable, with affective lability 
and demonstrated pervasive distrust and preoccupation with 
injustice and feelings of persecution. This persistent during 
first couple of days of hospitalization, but seemed to improve 
some after team started antidepressant medication and helped to 
address some psychosocial stressors. Patient was medication 
compliant, though complained Celexa caused sedation and this 
medication was subsequently administered at night. Patient began 
attending groups and found them helpful, but on multiple 
occasions felt violated or provoked by staff and become very 
upset, perseverative and difficult to console. 

Overwhelmingly, her initial sx of irritability/lability subsided 
and so did her paranoia.  She was able to make good 
relationships on the unit w/ others and was very positive w/ 
staff and primary team.

Safety: Patient remained in good behavioral control  throughout 
this hospitalization, except for outbursts in response to 
feeling persecuted or violated by staff, but she did not require 
physical or chemical restraint. The patient remained on 15

Discharge Instructions:
-Please also refer to the instructions provided to you by the 
manufacturer of this prosthesis

-ALWAYS call to inform, review and discuss any medication 
changes and your post-operative course with your primary care 
doctor.

-over the next several days you may experience some increased 
swelling of your phallus (and scrotum) resembling a semi-rigid 
phallus (semi-erect); this is ""normal"" from the prosthesis and 
related surgery/edema. This may be accompanied by discoloration 
(ecchymosis) involving the phallus and the scrotum; this too is 
normal and will gradually resolve.

-Please remove the surgical dressing over penis and/or under 
scrotum on post-operative day two: no further wound care is 
needed and you may leave the wound open to air. 

-Please keep your phallus at midline, pointed toward your 
umbilicus, taped in place with protective gauze/pads (if 
necessary) for the next ___ days. Of course you may point it 
downward for voiding.

-Use a jock-supporter/strap or jockey-type briefs or tight, 
tighty-whities to facilitate this; Subsequently you may 
transition to loose fitting briefs or boxer-briefs for 
support--they should be cotton and/or breathable.

-Do NOT use prosthesis for 6 weeks and until explicitly advised 
by your urologist

-Complete a 7 day course of antibiotics as directed 
(Ciprofloxacin/Cephalexin)

-You may shower, but do NOT bathe, swim or otherwise immerse 
your incision.

-Do NOT lift anything heavier than a phone book and no sports, 
vigorous physical activity (including sexual).

-Tylenol should be your first line pain medication, a narcotic 
pain medication has been prescribed for breakthough pain >4. 
Replace Tylenol with narcotic pain medication. Max daily Tylenol 
dose is 4gm, note that narcotic pain medication also contains 
Tylenol (acetaminophen)

operate dangerous machinery. 
For your safety, please do NOT DRIVE FOR ONE WEEK AFTER SURGERY 
or unless otherwise advised. 

-Colace has been prescribed to avoid post-surgical constipation 
and constipation related to narcotic pain medication, 
discontinue if loose stool or diarrhea develops. Colace is a 
stool ""softener""- it is NOT a laxative

-Resume your home medications, EXCEPT HOLD NSAIDs (aspirin, and 
ibuprofen containing products such as Advil & Motrin, Excedrin) 
for ONE week or until you see your urologist in follow-up OR you 
are explicitly advised to resume sooner by your PCP, ___ 
or Cardiologist.  DO NOT RESUME medications like VIAGRA, LEVITRA

Pertinent Results:
Troponin T <0.01, <0.___rief Hospital Course by Problem: 

#) Status post fall: on presentation to ___ patient was 
initially evaluated in the ER, and given that she had 
experienced an unwitnessed fall, she had multiple radiographic 
studies for furhter evaluation, CT of head showed no 
intracranial bleeding, CT of her cervical spine showed no 
fractures or dislocations, x-rays of her shoulders did not show 
any evidence of fracture.  Additionally in the ER, since her 
cervical spine had been cleared radiographically, they tried to 
clear her c-spine and take the cervical collar off but she 
complained of continued neck pain.  After speaking with 
neurosurgery, they recommended leaving the collar on for 2 weeks 
and then reassessing to see if her pain had resolved to take the 
collar off.  Patient can be seen by orthopedic surgery in two 
weeks for re-evaluation of the cervical collar.  Since the fall 
was unwitnessed and the patient was unable to give a good 
history, there was concern for the cause of this fall, patient 
was monitored on telemetry and also had an echocardiogram.  The 
echocardiogram was unchanged from prior studies, and while she 
was monitored on telemetry, it was noted that with reinitiation 
of her atenolol the patient's HR dropped to 35 while she was 
sleeping and then increased to the 40's when the nurses had 
woken her up.  Per nursing it was difficult to tell whether she 
was symptomatic since she seemed slightly confused at baseline.  
Given her decreased heart rate her atenolol was stopped and to 
control the patient's blood pressure, she was started on an ACE 
Inhibitor, lisinopril 10mg daily, that can be further titrated 
as an outpatient.  

#) Hypertension: Patient had previously been treated with 
atenolol 25mg daily, however given her very decreased HR, the 
medication was discontinued.  In the short term in the hospital 
she was controlled with 20mg po hydralazine, however for long 
term control she will be started on lisinopril 10mg daily, which 
can be titrated up as an outpatient.  Since she was just started 
on lisinopril, she will need to have her electrolytes checked in 
one week.

#) Dementia: remained stable in the hospital, continued her 
outpatient dose of aricept

#) Hypothyroid: currently being managed by her PCP, continued on 
her home synthroid dose

#) Osteoporosis: patient was continued on her calcium and 
vitamin D supplementation, however we would hold her 
bisphosphonate until the cervical collar is removed so that the 
patient can sit upright and take the medication safely. 

#) CAD: repeat echocardiogram showed no decline in LV systolic 
function, will continue aspirin but atenolol has been 
discontinued as patient's heart rate cannot tolerate beta 
blockade

Discharge Diagnosis:
1. Status Post Mechanical Fall

 
Discharge Condition:
At the time of discharge, patient was able to ambulate with a 
walker, tolerate oral intake without difficulty, her heart had 
increased off atenolol, other vital signs were stable and she 
was medically clear for discharge. 

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to ___ after falling at the nursing home, 
when you arrived in the emergency room, multiple radiology 
studies were done, which showed that you did have any bleeding 
your head or any other broken bones.  However, since you were 
still complaining of neck pain, even though the CT scan of the 
bones in your neck was normal, they were unable to remove the 
cervical collar.  Since no one had seen you fall, we were 
concerned about caused the fall, as a result we also did an 
echocardiogram to look at the function of your heart and 
monitored the rhythm of your heart while you were in the 
hospital.  The only concerning finding during your 
hospitalization was that when we restarted your atenolol, your 
heart rate decreased into the 30's while you were sleeping, and 
only increased into the 40's when you were awake, as a result we 
stopped this medication since we were concerned that this could 
have contributed to your fall.   

Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you have 
any other falls, experience a change in your vision, headaches, 
chest pain, palpitations or any other concerning symptoms.

      Specimen screened for: Adeno, Parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, 
Influenza A, B,
      and RSV by immunofluorescence. 
      Refer to respiratory viral culture for further 
information.

Studies:
.
CT Abd - IMPRESSION: 1. Unchanged moderate intra- and 
extrahepatic biliary dilation with smooth tapering of the 
hepatic duct below the insertion of the cystic duct. Gallbladder 
distension is likely related to the ductal process rather than 
acute cholecystitis given the lack of wall thickening or 
pericholecystic fluid but clinical correlation is advised. 2. 
Possible 12-mm hypodensity in the head of the pancreas which is 
most likely focal fat deposition and is unchanged from the prior 
study. A mass cannot be entirely excluded and MRCP could be 
obtained if clinically relevant. 3. No findings to explain a 
sterile pyuria. 4. Colonic diverticulosis without evidence of 
acute diverticulitis. 5. Marked degenerative changes of the 
thoracolumbar ___ with further cortical destruction of the T9 
vertebral body. 
.
MR ___ - 1. Findings involving the T9 vertebral body, as on 
the prompting CT, likely represent a relatively acute 
osteoporotic compression fracture with very prominent fracture 
cleft. 2. While there is no significant loss of height, there is 
some retropulsion of its dorsal cortex with possible impingement 
upon the exiting right T9 nerve root. 3. Associated abnormality 
of, particularly, the right anterolateral paraspinal soft 
tissues at this level, with an overall appearance most 
suggestive of associated hemorrhage/granulation tissue, with no 
finding to specifically suggest a neoplastic process. 4. Bone 
marrow signal abnormalities involving the contiguous T10 
vertebral body, supporting underlying osteoporotic nature of 
this process, related to axial- loading injury. 5. Several 
chronic thoracolumbar vertebral wedge deformities with 
retropulsion, as detailed; in particular, there is significant 
spinal canal narrowing at the T12-L1 level, with deformity of 
the distal spinal cord but no discrete signal abnormality. 6. No 
other pathologic focus of enhancement seen to specifically 
suggest neoplastic disease. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female past medical history of dementia, 
hypothyroid, hip replacement presenting from outside hospital 
with concern for new T9/T10 fracture status post fall who 
developed fevers in the ED.  
.  
#. Mechanical Fall: Initially there was concern for T9/T10 
Fracture at ___. The pt was transfered to ___ for 
orthopedics ___ eval who determined that the fracture was not 
acute. They recommended a TLSO for comfort only. Due to concern 
for possible malignancy, the patient underwent MRI scan of the 
___ on ___ which showed a relatively acute osteoporotic 
compression fracture with very 
prominent fracture cleft but no evidence of neoplastic disease. 
The patient was in a significant amount of back pain initially 
and received a combination of opiates, toradol, standing tylenol 
and lidocaine patch. In discussion with the patient's nursing 
facility it was determined that this pain was not much changed 
from the patient's baseline and that at the nursing facility the 
patient receives oxycontin 30mg BID. The patient was placed on 
this regimen with good improvement in pain although continues to 
have difficulty with turns/sitting/deep breahing. The TLSO brace 
was not yet ready at time of discharge. Discharged with plan for 
further pain management per provider at ___. Of 
note, a vertebroplasty was discussed to help palliate the 
patient's pain however it was decided that the risks outwighed 
benefits in this ___ year-old woman.
.  
#. Fever: The patient develoepd a fever to 102.0 in the ED. No 
clear source was identified initially. A UA showed pyuria 
however no bacteria and was nitrite negative. A CT torso at 
___ without evidence of pulmonary infiltrate.  Pt 
arrived to floor with foley in place, per records it was placed 
at ___ prior to transfer. This foley was removed on 
admission to the floor. Blood and Urine cultures remained 
negative and a respiratory viral screen including influenza was 
negative. The patient was afebrile throughout the remainder of 
her hospital course. 
.  
#Dementia- Pt severely demented at baseline per family. In the 
hosiptial she was oriented to eprson and place. At times able to 
answer questions appropriately. Continued on home donepezil.
.  
#Hypothyroidism- Continued home levothyroxine.
.
#. Transitional Issues:
1) Pain control: Optimize pain regimen with PO medications and 
can consider vertebroplasty as outpatient if not improving.
2) Orthopedics reccomended a TLSO brace for comfort. The brace 
was not yet ready at time of discharge. Can consider ordering at 
___.
3) Was saturating ~90% on RA. Most likely due to splinting from 
pain. On 2L O2 NC on discharge. 
4) Discontinued Seroquel as patient was overly sedated in-house. 
Can re-start if alertness improved at nursing facility.

Summary: This is a ___ yo female with h/o ETOH dependence who 
presented to ___ and found to have acute pancreatitis 
whose course c/b CT contrast infiltration into R wrist who was 
transferred to ___ for management of possible wrist 
compartment syndrome.
.
# Alcoholic Pancreatitis: The patient presented with severe 
epigastric pain, an inability to tolerate PO, and abnormal LFTs. 
She was found to have hyperbilirubinemia, transaminitis, 
hyponatremia and an anion gap metabolic acidosis. She was given 
IV fluids and IV morphine for pain control. Over the course of 
her stay, the patient started to tolerate a regular diet without 
nausea and vomiting. Her pain was better controlled and her LFTs 
trended to normal ranges. The patient was discharged with 16 
pills of Percocet and told to followup at her scheduled 
appointment or sooner with her primary care doctor if she 
requires more pain control. 

# ETOH Dependence/Withdrawl: The patient reportedly had been 
drinking heavily over the past year. During her stay, she 
developed increased anxiety, tremulousness, fever, and 
tachycardia. She was started on a CIWA scale and required PO 
Valium to help her. She also reports vivid nightmares. Social 
work consulted with the patient and suggested resources for her 
to explore as an outpatient. The patient has a desire to quit 
alcohol, but has too many life stressors. She was given Valium 
20 mg PO on discharge.

# Right Wrist Swelling: Orthopedics hand surgery evaluated the 
patient and thought that her swelling was possibly due to 
compartment syndrome. They recommended against surgical 
intervention and suggested keeping the arm elevated and 
controlling her pain. With elevation, the pain subsided. The 
hand always remained neurovascularly intact and had normal 
pulses/strength/sensation on discharge. Ortho hand said to 
followup PRN in their clinic.

Normocytic anemia: The patient continued to have a normocytic 
anemia. It was stable throughout her stay. If it persists, it 
will likely need to be assessed as an outpatient. On discharge 
her Hct was 34.8. 

Depression/anxiety: The patient has poor social support and 
psychiatric issues and uses alcohol to cope with her problems. 
Social work spoke with the patient and provided outpatient 
resources. She was given a three day supply of Ativan 1 mg BID: 
PRN anxiety.

Uninsured: The patient reports having no insurance and said it's 
difficult to fill prescriptions and see doctors. ___ social 
worker here linked the patient to a state-sponsored health 
insurance plan.

2. PSYCHIATRIC:
#) Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood  
___ is a ___ year old man, active service member 
___ Corps), with no significant PMH, PPHx of depression, 
sexual trauma, one previous near suicide attempt by hanging in 
___, no prior hospitalizations, who was brought in by ambulance 
after suicide attempt by cutting his neck with knife in the 
setting of alcohol use. Patient seen by trauma surgery in ED - 
sutures were placed and patient was medically cleared. Patient 
reported that primary stressors included family turmoil, 
holidays, and alcohol use. 
. 
On initial interview, Mr. ___ endorsed feeling ___ 
from family and friends at home, namely life outside ___ the 
___, which was exacerbated upon his return home for the 
holidays. He finds support from his friends in the military who 
have similar experiences, though does not feel that he can 
connect to
his former friends or family members. He states that after an 
argument with his family, he impulsively decided to attempt 
suicide by cutting his throat but expressed on initial 
evaluation remorse and guilt. He reported feeling grateful to be 
alive. On exam patient appeared calm, cooperative, with 4 cm 
laceration w/ 7 sutures placed overlying R carotid. Patient 
appeared initially dysthymic and tearful when discussing events 
leading up to hospitalization. He denied nonetheless any 
suicidal ideation, intent, or plan. Cognitive and neurologic 
exam were both unremarkable. 
. 
During the course of his hospitalization, Mr. ___ 
persistently denied any depressed mood, anhedonia, hopelessness, 
insomnia, or poor PO intake with no symptoms concerning for 
neurovegetative signs of depression. He endorsed an intact sense 
of self worth and was future oriented. Two family meetings were 
held with patient's family to discuss concerns, future 
treatment, and recommendations to increase communication within 
the family. Patient reported that by the end of his 
hospitalization, he felt more comfortable communicating with his 
family and felt surprised that his parents were vulnerable, 
sensitive, emotional, and able to empathically listen to his 
concerns. The team communicated with patient's ___ team 
including his lieutenant responsible for coordination of 
appointments; per his ___, patient will have robust 
supports in place upon return. During hospitalization, team 
additionally discussed minimizing alcohol use which appears to 
be a trigger. 
. 
Diagnostically, presentation appeared consistent with adjustment 
disorder w/ depressed mood as patient did not endorse persistent 
depressed mood/ anhedonia, neuro-vegeative symptoms, or any 
hopelessness/helplessness. Prior to discharge he denied any 
suicidal thoughts and appeared future oriented. His suicide 
attempt served the function of garnering family attention and 
was an expression of his distress, given this was a high 
lethality method of self harm but also equally high rescue given 
that the act was performed in the setting of acute intoxication 
and in front of his family. Patient does endorse some hx of 
trauma and subsequent nightmares/flashbacks, but his current 
presentation does not appear to be in the setting of post 
traumatic stress disorder. Prior to discharge, patient was 
intermittently tearful during family meeting but overall 
euthymic, with reactive affect and positive outlook regarding 
future. We had a very positive meeting with ___ and ___ 
prior to d/c where they were all able to acknowledge the need to 
communicate better.

RISK ASSESSMENT & PROGNOSIS
 . 
Patient has risk factors concerning for risk of self harm 
including recent suicide attempt, male gender, hx of trauma, 
alcohol use, and limited coping skills. However, patient has 
multiple protective factors and risk factors that were modified 
during the course of this hospitalization including 
establishment of outpatient providers, coordination of care, 
stronger family support, with patient expressing an intact sense 
of self worth, future oriented thought process, and patent 
appearing more help seeking in nature. As such patient's risk of 
harm to self per SAFE-T tool is now low.

ACTIVE ISSUES
.
# Fevers, bacteremia: Pt presented with fevers and rigors, N/V/D 
x 2 weeks. He was initially treated with gentamicin and then 
vanc and then zosyn at ___ over this time on multiple 
admissions, as described in the HPI. Blood cultures grew gram 
negative bacilli, later speciated as E coli.  His tunneled 
catheter was thought to be the most likely source and it was 
removed on ___ at ___. He was then transferred to ___ for 
further work-up and new line placement. He was started 
empirically on zosyn and switched to ceftriaxone when speciation 
from ___ returned as E. coli sensitive to ceftriaxone and 
ceftazidime. He does have a significant history of bacteremic 
infections, including lumbar osteomyelitis and bacterial 
endocarditis (unclear which valve, ?aortic) in ___ thought to 
be related to the peritoneal dialysis he was receiving at the 
time. Recurrence of these infections was considered as a 
possibility, especially given the fact that he endorsed lower 
back pain and had a III/VI systolic murmur. But he endorsed that 
his back pain is chronic, his murmur was noted in a transplant 
note from ___, and he had no other endocarditis stigmata, so 
these were thought to be less likely. It also was considered 
whether his painful joints could be infectious, but they were 
not warm, had minimal if any effusions, and he said that these 
joints are this painful at baseline. He was afebrile throughout 
his admission and blood cultures were consistently negative. He 
was switched on the day of discharge to ceftazidime 1g IV to be 
given at dialysis for 2 weeks. He will need follow-up at the 
___ clinic to monitor for signs of recurrent infection.  No 
TTE was obtained, given extremely low suspicion for 
endocarditis, however can consider doing this in the future to 
assess the cause of his prominent systolic murmur.
.
# ESRD: Pt was dialyzed on the day of admission, ___. His 
tunneled catheter was then removed at ___ on ___ and he was 
transferred to ___. Renal was consulted and they recommended 
that ___ place a new tunneled catheter for HD access. This was 
placed on ___ and he dialyzed immediately following placement. 
He is slated to have an eventual brachiobasilic fistula created 
with Dr. ___ the transplant service, who are following him 
longitudinally. He has a follow-up appointment with them 
scheduled for ___. His dialysis is coordinated by the prison on 
a MWF schedule and he will followup with the clinic there for 
his next dialysis session on ___.  Sevelamer was continued but 
at an increased dose.
.
# Joint pains:  Patient presented with L knee, ankle, big toe, 
and low back which have been worse over the past ___ months, but 
he apparently has had them for years. He has been treated for 
gout for years (though rheum at the prison has seen him and 
doubts gout). He attributes these current pains to gout. We were 
unable to attain original documentation of how the gout was 
diagnosed from the prison but he was treated for a flare as 
recently ___ with prednisone, ___, and allopurinol. There 
also was a question for septic arthritis or lumbar osteomyelitis 
given his bacteremia and fevers and PMHx of lumbar 
osteomyelitis, however his exam was not particularly impressive 
and this chronic time course would be unusual. He was maintaned 
on renally-dosed allopurinol (w HD) and his pain was controlled 
with oxycodone 5 mg q4 prn in house (for more reliable nonrenal 
clearance). He will followup with the prison clinic regarding 
the management of chronic joint pain. He was discharged on 
MScontin.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
.
# Hepatitis C: He has a history of chronic hep C with prior 
interferon treatment.He is not currently being treated. He 
presented to ___ with a mild transaminitis. It was unclear if 
this was acute from sepsis or evidence of evolving cirrhosis. He 
will follow up with the prison clinic regarding his chronic hep 
C. 
.
# Hypertension: Pt has baseline hypertension controlled with a 
home regimen. He was normotensive throughout his admission. Pt 
was restarted on home regimen but renal recommended stopping 
lisinopril, so it was discontinued on discharge.   
.
# Anemia: This is secondary to chronic renal disease, remained 
stable throughout admission. 
.
TRANSITION ISSUES
.
1. Fevers/bacteremia: Ensure afebrile, continue ceftazidime 
course. Consider ECHO to assess systolic murmur. 
.
2. ESRD: MWF dialysis.
.
3. Mild transaminitis: Consider repeat LFT's to ensure return to 
baseline.

Admitted on ___ for a fever of 105 with rigors at dialysis. He 
was started on vanc (14 days PTA), switched to zosyn on ___ 
(13days PTA)and had his tunnelled catheter removed. He was then 
transferred from ___ to ___ for further work up and 
management of dialysis access. On admission from ___, 
patient was treated with zosyn, which was narrowed to CTX given 
E. coli from ___ cultures sensitive to CTX and ceftaz. A new 
tunnelled HD line was placed by ___ on ___. He was discharged on 
ceftaz (10 days PTA) with a two week course to be dosed at 
dialysis. There was concern for a possible underlying source of 
persistent infection given frequent bactermia. Pt w/ h/o lumbar 
osteomyelitis, endocarditis in ___ thought to be related to PD 
he was getting at the time and has a persistent murmur. TTE was 
not pursued during prior admission as surveillance cultures at 
___ were negative and there was no stigmata of endocarditis.  
.  
On day of admission, temperature to 99.8 w/ chills at dialysis. 
Given IV vancomycin and ceftazadine after dialysis and was sent 
to ED. He denied pain at the catether site, but did endorse f/c 
and weakness. Also w/ pain in b/l ankles, knee, and hip (new) 
which he attributes to his gout, but worse pain than usual. 
Denies cough, SOB, CP, N/V/D, abdominal pain, rash, or change in 
mental status.  
.  
In the ED, initial VS were: 98.4 89 109/57 18 96%. Exam was 
notable for no tenderness, edema, discharge or erythema at the

___ TEE: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color 
Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal 
(LVEF>55%). There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic 
aorta at 35 cm. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The 
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. No masses or 
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen. No mass or vegetation is seen on the 
mitral valve. Mild (1+)ecentric mitral regurgitation is seen. No 
masses or vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but 
cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. There 
is no pericardial effusion. Impression: no vegetations seen  

___ Head CT w/o contrast: No hemorrhage, large territorial 
infarction, edema, mass, or shift of normally midline structures 
is present. Periventricular hyperdensities in the bilateral 
frontal lobes may represent acute infarcts or dilated 
___ spaces. The ventricles and sulci are normal in 
size and appearance. The basal cisterns are widely patent. 
Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated. 
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. 

___ CT T and L spine w/o contrast: 1. Destructive disc space 
changes at the L5-S1 disc space, endplate sclerosis and anterior 
osteophyte formation suggest that these are chronic changes from 
prior osteomyelitis. Comparison with prior imaging may be 
helpful. MRI is a more sensitive test for acute osteomyelitis. 
If the patient has a contraindication, a three-phased bone scan 
may be obtained.
___ CT pelvis w/ contrast: 1. The findings are in keeping 
with changes related chronic osteomyelitis/discitis at L5-S1. 
2. Grade 1 retrolisthesis of L5 on S1. 3. Moderate degenerative 
changes at the femoroacetabular joints. 4. No CT evidence of 
acute osteomyelitis or fracture. 
___ TTE: The left atrium is elongated. There is mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular 
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened (?#). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There 
are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. 
No vegetation seen (cannot definitively exclude).
___ ECG: Rate 78, Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation. Poor R 
wave progression, probably a normal variant. Non-specific ST-T 
wave changes, particularly in leads V4-V6. No previous tracing 
available for comparison.  
___ CXR: No acute intrathoracic process with an 8-mm nodule 
in the left base for with shallow obliques or non-emergent CT is 
recommended further evaluation.  
___ Xray pelvis: No fracture, dislocation, or definite 
radiographic evidence of acute steomyelitis, although please 
note evaluation of the inferior sacrum and coccyx is not 
optimal. If clinical concern is high, please note that MRI is 
more sensitive. 

 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Reason for Admission: low grade fever and chills at dialysis. 

___ yo M w/ h/o ESRD ___ to PCKD, on dialysis and recent 
admission for E. coli bacteremia who presented with chills and 
low grade fevers at dialysis session while on outpatient 
antibiotic (ceftazidime) regimen, now on vanc (___) and zosyn 
(___) with no growth in blood cultures to date. 
.
Active Issues:
# Low grade fevers- Patient was admitted for a temperature of 
99.8 at dialysis in the ___ week of treatment for e.coli 
bacteremia. Patient has been afebrile throughout admission and 
cultures drawn in the hospital had no growth.  Additionally 
cultures from ___ Dialysis unit from 
48hrs, 4 days and 7 days prior to admission had no growth.  
Because of this, it was felt that the patient's line could be 
left in place.  During admission, patient was treated with 
vancomycin (___) and zosyn (___). Patient had a history 
of osteomyelitis and endocarditis in ___, so these were 
evaluated with a TTE, TEE (requiring conscious sedation) and a 
CT spine which did not show evidence of current endocarditis or 
osteomyelitis. ID followed this patient throughout the admission 
and felt that given lack of fevers, negative blood blood 
cultures, and no obvious source, they felt he could go back to 
prison without antibiotics.
.  
# ESRD: Pt gets MWF dialysis, which was continued throughout the 
admission. Renal transplant service was made aware of patient's 
admission, as they are planning to create a brachiocephalic 
fistula for dialysis. Pt is on transplant list, transplant 
surgery elected to defer surgery while patient is being worked 
up for infection.  Continued home sevelamer, doxercalciferol and 
given lenient renal diet (per patient insistence) and was fluid 
restricted (1L/day). Patient will be seen by trasnplant shortly 
after discharge.
.  
# Joint pains: Pt w/ chronic pain of back, as well as L ankle 
and L great toe, which he attributes to gout. Patient remained 
on allopurinol during admission. Was not started on colchicine, 
and renal fellow recommended against this medication in ESRD 
patients. Ortho consult felt his back pain may be secondary to 
sacroiliitis. A pelvic xray did not show any fracture, 
dislocation, or acute osteo. A CT spine of his back did not show 
signs concerning for osteomyelitis either. Patient was continued 
on his home regimen of MS contin 30mg BID for chronic pain as 
well as started on NSAIDs for management of pain. Additonally 
complaining of locked DIP and PIP joints bilaterally, which was 
not actively assessed as an inpatient. Patient has outpatient 
follow up with orthopedic surgery.
.
# Hypertension: Patient's blood pressure ranged from the 
120s-140s in the hours after dialysis, to the 160s-190s in the 
day and a half leading up to the next dialysis session.  Patient 
c/o frequent HAs with elevated pressures and had an episode of 
vomitting with a BP of 177/90. During this time, pt had no 
papiledema or AMS. A CT head was negative for intracranial 
process and HA improved with hydralazine. Patient required 
several additional doses of hydralazine and lisinopril, and on 
the day prior to discharge, his standing lisinopril was 
increased from 5mg to 10mg PO daily with improved BPs 
(140s/80s). 
.  
Chronic Issues:
# Hepatitis C: Chronic hep C with prior interferon treatment. He 
is not currently being treated.  
- defer to outpatient management  
.  
# Anemia: Hct ranged from ___ throughout admission, baseline 
appears to be around 28. Secondary to chronic renal disease.  
Stable. Epo was held during admission for concern of possible 
history of parathyroid cancer. We were not able to locate 
records from his operation (only were able to determine from 
___ that it occurred in ___ in ___, 
___ prior to discharge.  After further discussion with 
nephrology, it was not felt that this distant and questionable 
history of cnacer should be a contraindication to epo so they 
were going to give instructions to resume epo in their sign-out 
to the patient's local hemodialysis center.
.  
# Lung nodule: 8 mm nodule in left base, new from prior studies. 
Will need follow up with non-emergent chest CT scan for further 
characterization as an outpatient.
.
Transitional Issues: Patient is incarcerated and gets his care 
at ___. Do not ___ any transitional issues.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital because you were having low 
grade fevers during your dialysis session.  You were being 
treated for a bacteria in your blood at your outpatient dialysis 
unit for the past 2 weeks, and so we were worried that the 
antibiotics you were on were not treating your infection.  While 
you were in the hospital, we gave you 2 strong antibiotics.  You 
did not have a fever in the hospital and we never found any 
bacteria growing in your blood.  The blood drawn at your 
dialysis unit also never had any bacteria growing in it. We did 
some imaging of your back and heart because we were concerned 
that you may have an infection in either of these areas, however 
there was no evidence of infection on these studies.  Because 
there is not evidence that you are still infected, we have 
stopped your antibiotics.  It is common to have low grade fevers 
while getting dialysis, so this may be a chronic event for you. 
If you remain afebrile over the next week (with a temperature 
not greater than 100.4F), you should be able to have a fistula 
or graft placed soon.  We have made an appointment with your 
transplant surgeon, Dr. ___, for next week (see 
details below), so that you will have close follow up and so the 
procedure will be done as soon as possible.

You were noted to have a lung nodule of unknown significance on 
CXR. You should follow up with your PCP and should be scheduled 
for an outpatient Chest CT to follow this.

Please continue your home medication as prescribed.  You no 
longer need to take Ceftazidime, the antibiotic you were getting 
at dialysis.

The following changes have been made to your medications:
- please INCREASE lisinopril to 10 mg daily
- please START ibuprofen 400 mg every 8 hours, if this isn't 
managing your pain, you can increase to 600 or 800 mg every 8 
hours.  Please be sure to take ibuprofen with food, do not take 
it on an empty stomach.
- please STOP taking ceftazidime.  There is no active evidence 
of infection, so you do not need any antibiotics right now.

The rest of your medications have not changed.  Please continue 
to take them as originally prescribed.

Chest X-Ray ___:
PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: Right-sided dual-lumen 
dialysis catheter tip terminates in the proximal right atrium, 
unchanged. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are 
within normal limits. The pulmonary vascularity is normal. 8-mm 
rim calcified nodular opacity within the left lung base appears 
unchanged. Lungs are clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax 
is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities. Multiple 
clips are seen in the right upper quadrant. Calcifications are 
noted in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, compatible with 
calcifications seen within innumerable left renal cysts on CT. 
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality, and no 
interval change from prior. 
.
MRI Lumbar spine without contrast ___:
Endplate erosion with loss of disc height at L5-S1 levels, with 
mild increased T2 signal, likely representing chronic discitis 
osteomyelitis. Additionally there is a disc bulge and bilateral 
facet arthrosis at this level causing moderate bilateral neural 
foramina narrowing and compression of the L5 nerve roots and 
abutting the S1 nerve roots. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old incarcerated male with ESRD secondary to Polycystic 
Kidney Disease on HemoDialysis with recent E. coli bacteremia 
diagnosed by Blood culture from outside hospital on ___ 
believed secondary to HD line infection, presented this time 
with fevers, chills/rigors, found to have 1 out of 4 bottle E 
coli bacteremia. He was stable and discharged on Bactrim for 1 
week. 
.
# Fevers: Patient admitted to ___ for the third time in the 
past month with fevers and rigors. Patient last had 
blood-culture proven E. coli bacteremia in ___. The 
source of infection is most likely the tunneled right-sided HD 
line, but blood cultures during this admission only grew E. coli 
in one bottle, so contamination of the sample by multiple 
hospital admission acquired skin flora cannot be ruled out and 
bacteremia cannot be ruled in. Patient's history is also 
significant for chronic osteomyelitis of his lumbar spine, but 
no acute infection was evident on MRI. Patient was initially 
treated wtih ceftazidime in the ED, broaded to 
vancomycin/cefepime, and after the culture returned GNR, 
narrowed to cefepime only. After speciation and sensitivity 
returned, and given question of bacteremia, patient was treated 
conservatively with Bactim DS once a day at evening for a total 
of 7 days without need for a line change at this time.
.  
# ESRD: He continued to receive MWF dialysis in-house. Renal 
transplant service and Transplant surgery were aware of pt on 
previous admission and were informed of current admission. 
Patient continued his home sevelamer, doxercalciferol, renal 
caps, and renal diet in-house.  
.  
# Chronic joint pains: Patient has chronic pain of back, knees 
and ankles which he attributes to gout. Previous ortho consult 
felt his back pain may be secondary to sacroiliitis, pelvic xray 
did not show any fracture, dislocation, or acute osteomyelitis, 
and CT spine did not show signs concerning for osteomyelitis 
either. Diagnosis of gout is questionable given chronicity of 
pains, location, and pain without signs consistent with acute 
gout flares. Rheumatology at the ___ has seen the patient and 
doubts gout. Have been unable to attain original documentation 
of how the gout was diagnosed, but pt was most recently treated 
for a flare in ___ with prednisone, ___, and 
allopurinol. MRI of lumbar spine was done this admission and 
showed signs of chronic osteomyelitis and bilateral neural 
foramina narrowing and compression of the L5 nerve roots and 
abutting the S1 nerve roots, likely the source of the pain. No 
evidence of acute osteomyelitis was seen. Patient's pain was 
controlled with his home regimen of MS contin and allopurinol.
.
# Hypertension: Controlled in house with home dose of lisinopril 
and metoprolol.
.
Transitional Issues:
1. Please follow up with pending blood cultures. 
2. Replacement of HD catheter once antibiotic course is 
complete.
3. Completion of bactrim course

WBC Tagged Scan/ Bone scan (___)- negative
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ M with ESRD on HD, HTN, chronic osteomyelitis and multiple 
admissions for fevers presenting with fever following HD.

# Fevers - Patient has had multiple admissions for transient 
fevers, often following HD, with blood cultures occasionally 
positive for E.coli.  Fevers only began once tunnel catheter was 
placed, after AVF clotted.  ESR and CRP are at patient's 
baseline so unlikely acute on chronic osteomyelitis.  In 
addition, patient had no worsening of his low back pain.  
Radiography showed stable process as well. CXR showed no acute 
cardiopulmonary process.  Patient given vancomycin/cefepime x1 
in ER.  Overnight on HD1/2 patient spiked fevers to 103.2 and on 
HD2, tunneled catheter line was pulled and patient was started 
on vancomycin and ceftazadime with dialysis. Patient was given a 
line holiday for 2 days prior to replacement of line.  Line tip 
culture grew strep viridans, coag negative staph, non hemolytic 
strep and corynebacterium consistent with skin or oral flora. 
Blood cultures were negative to date on the day of discharge.  
Patient was afebrile following removal of HD line and did not 
have further fevers.  He completed a 7 day course of vancomycin 
and cefepime following the discontinuation of the HD line.  
Other potential sources of occult infection were investigation 
with a CT abdomen, prostate ultrasound, WBC tagged scan and bone 
scan.  All of these studies were negative for infection.  

# ESRD on HD - Patient gets dialysis ___. 
He was continued on his home sevelamer, doxercalciferol and 
nephrocaps while inpatient. He was dialyzed on ___ 
prior to removal of original tunneled HD line, and spiked a 
fever to 105.  The line was removed following dialysis and 
patient had a ""line holiday"" until ___ when a 
new tunneled cath was placed without issue.  Patient was 
dialyzed on ___ and ___ as scheduled following 
replacement of catheter.  He had no fevers during or following 
dialysis.  Patient has follow-up scheduled with surgical team 
regarding AV fistula v graft.

# Leukopenia/Thrombocytopenia - Has had WBC as low as 2.8 back 
in ___, this appears to be the first time platelets have 
dipped so low. Patient recently on bactrim which ended 1.5 weeks 
ago, and working diagnosis was residual thrombocytopenia due 
this antibiotic.  In addition, with history of HepC, may be due 
to decreased liver function.  Platelets initially trended down, 
but were increasing above admission levels at the time of 
discharge.

# Chronic pain - Has chronic joint pains which have been 
associated with gout in the past. Also with history of chronic 
osteomyelitis as above.  Pain was at baseline and well 
controlled on home regimen of amitriptyline, MS contin 30mg BID, 
ropinirole.  
  
# Hypertension: Patient was intiially continued on lisinopril 
and metoprolol at home doses.  On HD 4, blood pressures were 
elevated, likely in the setting of volume overload due to 
dietary indiscretions and no HD over the weekend.  Patient was 
given hydralazine 25mg q6h, and following dialysis with removal 
of 4.5L, pressures remained elevated.  Lisinopril was increased 
to 40mg daily as well and patient was discharged on hydralazine 
and new dose of lisinopril.   Consider titrating off of 
hydralazine as full effect of lisinopril is seen.
  
# Hepatitis C: Chronic hep C with prior interferon treatment 
dc'ed for GI bleed and ineffectiveness. He is not currently 
being treated.  
  
# Anemia: On prior admission Hct ranged from ___ throughout 
admission, baseline appears to be around 28, secondary to 
chronic renal disease and possibly iron deficiency.  Hematocrit 
remained at baseline throughout admission.

# Transitional issues:
- Please titrate down and discontinue entirely if blood 
pressures well controlled on increased dose of lisinopril.
- 8-mm rim calcified nodular opacity within the left lung base 
noted on CXR, patient will need a non-emergent CT scan to better 
evaluate  
- Patient will have follow-up with surgical team regarding AV 
fistula/graft.  This should be done as soon as possible to avoid 
further tunneled line infections.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
It was a pleasure taking care of you during your recent 
admission to ___.

You were admitted because of a high fever following 
hemodialysis.  You have had frequent fevers following dialysis 
in the past due to bacteria in your blood.  Blood tests were 
drawn and you were monitored in the hospital for 24 hours.  You 
did not spike any more fevers, and your blood cultures remained 
negative.  The catheter tip grew some bacteria, and so you were 
continued on antibiotics.  In addition, you had an abdominal CAT 
scan to ensure there was no infection in your abdomen.  This 
exam was negative.

Your tunneled catheter line was replaced after a ""line holiday"" 
for two days.

Medication changes:
- INCREASE lisinopril to 40mg daily
- START hydralazine 25mg four times day, this should be tapered 
down and discontinued as your blood pressure responds to the 
increased dose of lisinopril

Brief Hospital Course:
On ___, he underwent renal transplant from a HCV positive 
donor (recipient's HCV VL was 1,100,000 cop/ml on ___ 
right iliac fossa with neo ureterocystostomy over a ___ 
double-J stent with JP drain placed. Small amounts of urine were 
made immediately. Surgeon was Dr. ___. A peritoneal 
tear occurred during mobilization of the peritoneum during 
vascular exposure. Per report the kidney was decapsulated. A old 
stent was also removed from left forearm. Please refer to 
operative note for details. Postop, vital signs.   

Urine output was scant. IV hydration was given. Creatinine 
remained elevated. On postop day 1, potassium was elevated to 
7.0. He experienced delayed renal graft function (DGF). 
Hemodialysis was performed via the tunnelled right IJ line. 
Urine output was scant averaging 32-0cc/day. IV fluid was 
stopped and hemodialysis continued with last treatment on ___ 
for 2300ml. Weight was 75.5kg on ___.  

He was given a total of 4 doses of ATG, Cellcept and tapering 
doses of steroids per protocol until off (last dose ___. 
Prograf was started on postop day 0. Trough levels were low 
(goal 10)and dose was up titrated to 10mg bid on ___. 

Labs were notable for hct that trended down daily to 24 on 
___. Epogen was planned for dialysis days. 

He was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating independently 
(steady on feet)and RLQ incision was clean, dry and intact with 
staples. The JP drain output was high initially (720ml/day)and 
thus the drain remained in place. Output decreased to 115 ml by 
postop day 5. JP drain fluid was serosanguinous and creatinine 
of this fluid was 6.8 ruling out a urine leak (similar to 
serum). He did have a small amount of scrotal edema and was 
instructed to elevate scrotum on a towel. 

Left forearm incision was intact with staples without 
redness/drainage. 

He was discharged back to prison.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old man with PMH of APCKD s/p CDC high 
risk donor transplant on ___ who presented from ___ with 
hyponatremia. 

#. Hyponatremia - The patient presented with a sodium of 121. 
This was thought to be related to decreased PO intake recently 
as he has been on a religious fast. Also had been drinking more 
when told to increase hydration for better kidney perfusion (see 
below). Exercises vigorously daily and likely loses salt in that 
setting. The patient's sodium improved while here with simple PO 
intake encouragement. Never had MS changes. Sodium was 133 on 
day of dsicharge. 

#. Renal txpt, AOCKD - The patient's Cr has been elevated since 
___ to 2.2 from a baseline ~1.8. No clear etiology and this 
remained stable while here. He was continued on all 
immunosupressives and taro level was at goal between ___. 
Urinalysis was unremarkable as was a renal ultrasound. Further 
follow-up as an outpatient is warranted. Continued on bactrim 
PPx. 

#. Hyperkalemia - The patient's potassium was elevated in house. 
Never had ECG changes. Switched to a low-K diet and Ace-I 
stopped. Potassium was 5.4 on day of discharge. 

#. Leukopenia - The patient had a mild leukopenia in house. 
Unclear etiology and resolved on its own prior to discharge. Was 
on azithro when admitted for a possible sinus infection, however 
had no infectious symptoms in-house and this was stopped. 

#. HTN - Lisinopril was held due to ___ and hyperkalemia. The 
patient remained normotensive in-house.

#. Osteoporosis - Continued home medications. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Please check chemistry panel and CBC this week. Fax results to 
___ Att: Dr. ___ ___
- Patient to follow-up with Dr. ___ on ___
- Ensure patient is eating three meals daily and staying well 
hydrated. Low potassium diet.
- Monitor BP. ___ need an alternative agent added if becomes 
increasingly hypertensive. Lisinopril was stopped in-house.

ACTIVE ISSUES 
===========
# Abdominal Pain
# Diarrhea, bloody
Presented with sudden onset diffuse abdominal pain shortly after 
eating dinner. CT scan with duodenitis of unclear significance, 
and mild enlargement of the kidney with perinephric stranding. 
No evidence of obstruction, appendicitis. Ischemic colitis 
considered given bloody stools, but given chronicity of pain 
with repeated normal lactate, was thought less likely. 
Infectious diarrhea is most likely given
immunosuppression with no clear history or symptoms of 
inflammatory diarrhea and reportedly unremarkable recent 
endoscopic evaluation. Stool studies unrevealing and abdominal 
pain/diarrhea improved without intervention, likely etiology 
viral gastroenteritis. He received dilaudid and acetaminophen 
while in house, discharged without opioids. By discharge was 
tolerating regular diet.  Consider GI follow up as an outpatient
 
# ESRD s/p renal transplant:
# Hyperkalemia
He has had prior subacute antibody mediated rejection in ___, 
with DSAs to DQ7 and B18, treated with IVIG, steroids, 
rituximab, and change of immunosuppression from rapamycin to 
tacrolimus. Biopsy in ___ showed more chronic damage. He has 
had moderate proteinuria for some time now, likely due to 
transplant glomerulopathy. He did not have ___ as Cr was near 
recent baselines per transplant database. Renal transplant U/S x 
2 w/ stable elevated resistive indices compared to prior studies
but no fluid collections, hydro with no changes on close follow 
up scan. Renal biopsy was deferred. Discontinued losartan and 
Bactrim given persistent hyperkalemia and started sodium 
bicarbonate 1300mg BID, atovaquone for ppx. 
Discharge Immunosuppression
- tacrolimus 3mg Q12h
- mycophenolate myfortic 360mg PO BID
- prednisone 5mg PO daily
- atovaquone 1500 daily

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital for abdominal pain and 
diarrhea. You had a thorough evaluation including a CT scan and 
stool studies. The stool studies were reassuring. The CT scan 
showed duodenitis (inflammation of your small bowel). The most 
likely cause of your pain and diarrhea was a viral infection of 
you GI system. 

During your hospitalization, you immunosuppression for your 
kidney transplant was adjusted. You were started on a new 
medication called atovaquone to prevent infection, as well as a 
blood pressure medication called nifedipine. Please stop taking 
the Bactrim and losartan. 

Please follow up with your outpatient providers as below.

Wishing you well,

Your ___ Care Team

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ w/ ESRD s/p deceased donor renal 
transplant in ___ complicated by chronic allograft dysfunction 
(antibody-mediated rejection ___, biopsy-confirmed chronic 
transplant glomerulopathy, interstitial fibrosis & tubular 
atrophy ___, HTN, GERD, HCV s/p ledipasvir-sofosbuvir, & 
hyperparathyroidism s/p sub-total parathyroidectomy ___ who 
presented with increasing shortness of breath. 

# Dyspnea
# ?Acute CHF Exacerbation 
The patient presented with a history of orthopnea & dyspnea w/ 
CXR findings of bilateral effusions & pulmonary vascular 
congestion consistent with fluid overload state. His weight was 
noted to be higher recently from prior discharge. No medication 
non-adherence or dietary changes although the recent addition of 
sodium bicarbonate may be contributing due to increased Na load. 
Patient's blood pressures were uncontrolled & likely further 
increased his left-sided afterload. A TTE on ___ revealed 
elevated PCWP and E/E' with preserved EF. Overall patient 
reported symptomatic improvement with diuresis and his daily 
weights continued to trend down. Although there are no concerns 
of rejection based on a bland urine sediment and an unremarkable 
renal ultrasound, the etiology of the patient's volume overload 
may have been in part also been caused by worsening renal 
function as evidenced by creatinines in the 4s compared to his 
baseline of creatinine in the 3s. Patient was diuresed with IV 
furosemide PRN and transitioned to oral diuretics. His 
electrolytes are monitored and repleted as needed. His labetalol 
was increased to 600 mg 3 times daily and he was continued on 
his nifedipine 30 mg daily.

# ___:
# ESRD w/p transplant c/b chronic rejection:
Cr 4 on presentation, up from discharge 3.2 on ___. His elevated 
creatinine may be cardiorenal in etiology given clinical context 
and possible end-organ damage in setting of hypertension but 
worsening overall renal function cannot be ruled out given lack 
of significant improvement with diuresis. His renal US had no 
evidence/concern for hydronephrosis and there was less concern 
for rejection at this time given bland urine and lack of 
characteristics findings on renal US. The patient's renal 
function was trended daily. He was continued on his 
immunosuppressive regimen of mycophenolate, tacrolimus, and 
prednisone. His tacrolimus levels were trended daily. He was 
continued on atovaquone prophylaxis. His MAPs were maintained 
above 65. He is also continued on calcium and cinacalcet. Sodium 
bicarbonate was held in the setting of his volume overloaded 
state. His blood pressure was better controlled as noted.

# HTN:
The patient was noted to have systolic blood pressure readings 
in the ___. He was previously on losartan & labetalol last 
hospitalization but losartan was held on discharge given 
persistent hyperkalemia. At that time, labetalol dosing was 
increased to 400mg TID from 200mg BID & nifedipine ER 30mg QD 
was initiated. No evidence of renal artery stenosis in 
transplant kidney as though no changes in resistive indices. The 
patient's labetalol was increased to 600 mg 3 times daily and he 
was continued on nifedipine along leading to better blood 
pressure control.

# Mild Hyperkalemia:
Patient presented with mild hyperkalemia and on review of 
records, it appeared that patient was chronically mildly 
hyperkalemic. His hyperkalemia improved with ongoing IV diuresis 
with Furosemide. 

# Normocytic anemia:
His home hemoglobin was similar to baseline values in setting of 
end-stage renal disease. His CBCs were trended daily and he did 
not require a blood transfusion during his hospitalization.

# GERD:
Continued on his prior dose of ranitidine.

# Insomnia:
Continued on his prior dose of amitriptyline. His ramelteon was 
held due to concerns of possible toxicity to the renal 
transplant.

PERTINENT IMAGING:
=================
___ Scrotal Ultrasound:
Findings equivocal for bilateral epididymitis.

___ Renal Transplant Ultrasound:
1. No hydronephrosis.
2. Normal intrarenal resistive indices, slightly decreased from 
prior.
3. Main renal artery and main renal vein are patent with 
appropriate
waveforms.
4. Unchanged 4 mm right lower pole renal lesion, possibly a 
small
angiomyolipoma.

___ Left Hip Xray:
No acute fracture.  There is mild degenerative changes of the 
hip, and partial ankylosis of the SI joints and degenerative 
discopathy and facet OA at L5/S1, that could potentially 
contribute to patient's symptoms.  If there remains high 
clinical suspicion for occult injury, further evaluation with CT 
is an option.

___ Second Opinon OSH CT Abd/pelvis:
1. No hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis of the right lower 
quadrant transplant kidney.
2. Improvement in perinephric stranding compared to prior study 
from ___.

___ CXR:
There is moderate pulmonary edema and layering bilateral pleural 
effusions. No pneumothorax.  The size of the cardiac silhouette 
is within normal limits.

___ TTE:
The left atrial volume index is mildly increased. The right 
atrium is mildly enlarged. There is no evidence for an atrial 
septal defect by 2D/color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with a normal cavity size. There is 
normal regional and global left ventricular systolic function. 
The visually estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is 
65%. There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract 
gradient. No ventricular septal defect is seen. Tissue Doppler 
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP 
greater than 18mmHg). Mildly dilated right ventricular cavity 
with normal free wall motion. The aortic sinus diameter is 
normal for gender with normal ascending aorta diameter for 
gender. The aortic arch diameter is normal. There is no evidence 
for an aortic arch coarctation. The aortic valve leaflets are 
moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve 
area 1.5-1.9 cm2). There is trace aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with no mitral valve 
prolapse. There is an eccentric, inferolateral directed jet of 
moderate [2+] mitral regurgitation. Due to acoustic shadowing, 
the severity of mitral regurgitation could be UNDERestimated. 
Due to the Coanda effect, the severity of mitral regurgitation 
could be UNDERestimated. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear 
structurally normal. There is mild [1+] tricuspid regurgitation. 
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There 
is a trivial pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
preserved biventricular systolic function. Increased left 
ventricular filling pressure. Mild aortic stenosis. Moderate 
mitral regurgitation. Mild tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate 
pulmonary hypertension.

___ MRI Left Hip w/o Contrast:
1. Mild degenerative changes of the left hip.  No findings to 
suggest 
infection or avascular necrosis. 
2. Chronic appearing tear of the anterosuperior aspect of the 
left acetabular labrum. 
3. Degenerative disc disease in the lower lumbar spine better 
evaluated on the dedicated lumbar spine MRI performed on the 
same date. 

___ MRI L Spine w/o Contrast:
1. L5-S1 loss of disc height, disc irregularity, endplate 
irregularities, and L5 loss of height are again demonstrated, 
suggesting either chronic 
spondyloarthropathy secondary to end-stage renal disease, versus 
sequela of prior discitis/osteomyelitis.  Also unchanged mild 
retrolisthesis and 
prominent epidural fat at this level.  Unchanged mild narrowing 
of the thecal sac and severe bilateral neural foraminal 
narrowing at this level. 
2. Mild spinal canal narrowing at L2-L3 and L3-L4 has progressed 
since ___. Moderate L3-L4 neural foraminal narrowing has 
slightly progressed on the right but is not significantly 
changed on the left. 
3. At L4-L5, moderate right and severe left neural foraminal 
narrowing, as 
well as mild, left greater than right subarticular zone 
narrowing, are not 
significantly changed. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o male with a history of ESRD ___ PCKD s/p 
deceased donor renal transplant (___) c/b chronic allograft 
dysfunction, now back on HD since ___, HCV s/p Harvoni, and 
HTN who presented with left flank/hip/testicular pain. 
Infectious work up was unremarkable. MRI spine was notable for 
degenerative disc disease, likely causing radicular pain. 
Chronic pain service and orthopedic surgery were consulted and 
recommended ongoing pain management. 

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
#Left flank/hip/back pain, severe uncontrolled pain
#Neuropathic pain
The patient presented with ___ weeks of left flank pain that 
then moved into his left hip, thigh, groin and left testicle. 
Initial evaluation was notable for CVA tenderness and left 
testicular tenderness concerning for UTI/nephrolithiasis vs 
epididymitis. CT abd/pelvis showed an atrophic kidney without 
nephrolithiasis or pyelonephritis and testicular ultrasound was 
equivocal for epidimyitis. He was initially started on broad 
spectrum antibiotics, which were discontinued after urine 
culture, GC & chlamydia returned negative. Given persistent 
pain, MRI L-spine and pelvis were done, demonstrating L5-S1 
changes c/w chronic spondyloarthropathy ___ ESRD vs sequela of 
prior discitis, as well as severe left-sided L4-L5 neural 
foraminal narrowing. The L4-L5 was felt to be the etiology of 
his pain given the correlating location. Chronic pain service 
and orthopedic surgery were consulted and provided recommends 
for pain management. He was continued on oxycodone, 
amitriptyline and started on tizanidine as well as lyrica with 
improvement in his pain. He will follow up in the ___ spine 
clinic for further management. 

#ESRD ___ PCKD s/p renal transplant c/b rejection now on HD
Presented with moderate volume overload, particularly noted to 
have bilateral pleural effusions on CXR. He underwent multiple 
daily sessions of dialysis with improvement and then was 
transitioned to his normal regimen. He had significant weight 
gain between sessions and required tighter fluid restriction, 
which should be continued as an outpatient. Additionally, his 
home prednisone and tacrolimus were continued.

#Acute hypoxic respiratory failure
#Acute pulmonary edema
Patient noted to have rapidly worsening hypoxia one evening 
during his hospitalization briefly requiring a non-rebreather. 
Repeat CXR showed significant pulmonary edema with bilateral 
effusions. He was started on a nitroglycerin gtt and underwent 
urgent bedside dialysis overnight with improvement in his 
clinical status. He was rapidly weaned to room air and remained 
stable for the remainder of the hospitalization. 

#NSTEMI
Troponin 0.08 on admission and continued to rise to 0.45 in the 
setting of fluid overload and acute hypoxic respiratory failure. 
EKG showed borderline submillimeter ST depressions in I, V5-V6 
(different from baseline), which was stable/improving on serial 
EKGs. He denied having any chest pain during this time. 
Cardiology was consulted and felt the presentation was 
consistent with type II NSTEMI due to fluid overload. Follow up 
TTE did not demonstrate a wall motion abnormality. Ultimately, 
cardiology decided against stress test at this time. He was 
discharged on his home aspirin with the addition of atorvastatin 
and metoprolol. 

#Atrial fibrillation 
Noted to be in atrial fibrillation on ___, which rapidly 
resolved within hours to a day. This was a new diagnosis for the 
patient, felt to be ___ fluid shifts vs less likely cardiac 
ischemia. TSH normal. His home labetalol was switched to 
metoprolol and his heart rate and rhythm remained stable. Given 
a CHADSVASC of 1, anticoagulation was not started.  

#Access
Newly placed fistula with some ulceration. He should follow up 
with Dr. ___ in Nephrology to evaluate as an outpatient. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
#Hypertension
He was continued on his home nifedipine. He refused several 
daily doses of labetalol, stating the dose was too high. Given 
new episode of atrial fibrillation, possible cardiac disease, 
and normotensive pressures without labetalol, he was switched to 
metoprolol and remained stable on this regimen.  

#Normocytic anemia 
Hemoglobin stable from prior, felt to be ___ anemia of chronic 
disease ___ ESRD
and iron deficiency. He was continued on his on iron 
supplementation. 

#GERD
- Continued ranitidine 

#BPH
- Continued tamsulosin

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[ ] Follow up in ___ Spine Clinic on ___ and with your 
primary care provider ___ ___ weeks 
[ ] Monitor pain, titrate medications as necessary, consider 
down-titrating back to oxycodone 10 mg TID if pain improves and 
able 
[ ] Monitor mental status on several sedating medications - 
consider stopping tizanidine in the future once pain improves 
given unclear benefit
[ ] Blood pressure regimen changed, follow up BP and titrate as 
necessary 
[ ] Developed one episode of atrial fibrillation, if future 
episodes occur, consider further discussion regarding 
anticoagulation 
[ ] Ensure the patient is adhering to a 1.5-2L fluid restriction 

[ ] Recommend follow up Echocardiogram in ___ years

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___!

Why you were admitted to the hospital:
- You were having pain in your side, back, hip and groin

What happened while you were here:
- Infectious work up was unremarkable - specifically you had no 
infection in your urine or testicles 
- There was concern for a kidney stone though imaging did not 
show this so it was felt to be less likely
- MRI of your back showed narrowing and pressure on the nerves, 
which was felt to be the cause of your pain 
- Orthopedic spine surgery and the pain service were consulted 
and assisted with pain management
- Additionally, you had significant fluid overload (fluid in 
your lungs), requiring oxygen and repeat dialysis sessions 
- Lab tests showed that there was additional stress on your 
heart. You should continue taking your heart medications as 
prescribed. 

What you should do once you leave the hospital:
- Please continue taking your medications as prescribed
- Please follow up at the appointments outlined below 

Sincerely,
Your ___ Care Team

Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
Hand and foot wounds
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is as ___ incarcerated male with ESRD
secondary to PCKD s/p failed kidney transplant in ___ and on HD
___, Hepatitis C (treated), HTN, hx of osteomyelitis/
endocarditis per chart review, and carotid stenosis who is
presenting with approximately 4 months of worsening bilateral
hand and unilateral foot pain swelling and skin breakdown. 

He reports no known antecedent trauma to his hands and his feet
but has had progressive pain and discoloration of two fingers on
his right hand, one finger on his left hand, and right big toe.
He reports trying to seek help earlier but was unable to get
medical attention at his ___ facility. The pain has
progressively gotten worse to now ___ pain, limiting his
ability to ambulate and use his hands.

Regarding his ulcers, per outpatient notes, Mr. ___ has a 
long
history of manipulative and self-injurious behavior. The wound 
on
the right hand started as a small cut likely from trimming his
finger nails. Without adequate wound care or dressing changes,
this progressed into a blister and then further progressed to 
the
necrotic lesion.

He had an ultrasound of the right subclavian to rule out 
thrombus
and an echo which showed no vegetations. ANCA panel and
cryoglobulins were negative. He had a period where the hand
became edematous and erythematous, with elevated ESR and CRP and
was treated with IV vanco and ceftaz with improvement in the
wound appearance, edema and erythema. Despite this, he continued
to be non-compliant with wound care.

He was seen by Vascular Surgery at ___ and on ___ an
arteriogram was done there showing:

The right subclavian artery axillary and brachial arteries were
all widely patent.  The right ulnar artery was the primary
outflow to the hand as the radial artery occluded in the distal
forearm.  On the left the subclavian axillary and brachial
arteries were all widely patent.  There was reversal of flow
distal to the fistula, the fistula filled very quickly.  With
fistula compression the ulnar artery had improved flow and was
the primary runoff to the hand as the radial artery occluded in
the mid forearm.  Of note, there was significant sluggish flow
throughout all of his vessels concerning for a possible central
source.

Dr. ___ performed the study, had no good explanation
for the very sluggish flow in this patient whose last EF was
normal. There were no treatable lesions as above.

Dr. ___, the transplant physician who has been managing his 
left upper extremity fistula, felt that ligating the fistula 
would be recommended in this setting to optimize flow to the 
left hand and help healing as much as possible, although patient 
has declined in the past. This may be an elective option in the 
future.

of progressively worsening chronic hand ischemia. Duration seems 
likely ___ months, as not noted on prior admission discharged in 
___. Per outpatient notes, injury was apparently incurred and 
resulted in worsening appearance and apparent concern for 
superinfection which was treated with IV Vanc/Ceftaz at ___ 
additionally, reportedly ANCA and Cryoglobulins were sent and 
were negative. When not improved, patient was sent to ___ 
where arteriogram shows sluggish flow without evidence of a flow 
limiting lesion. This may be seen in the presence of a central 
lesion or can also be seen in advanced heart failure, however EF 
was noted to be preserved. Broad differential was considered for 
decreased perfusion and vasculopathy including peripheral 
arterial disease, embolic (hypercoagulability, infectious, 
central lesion) vasculitis(small/medium/large vessel 
involvement, cryoglobulinemia) with work up unrevealing. He also 
underwent CTA chest which did not show a central lesion in his 
aorta. He had ABIs of the lower extremities which showed 
significant vascular occlusive disease. Calciphylaxis was 
considered, dermatology was consulted but thought unlikely given 
isolated involvement of fingertips. For potential benefit of 
increased perfusion via vasodilation, nifedipine was uptitrated. 
Tacrolimus was discontinued after discussion with renal given 
limited benefit to graft and known side effect of 
vasoconstriction. Admission radiographs concerning for R digit 
osteomyelitis and as such MR was obtained which was not fully 
completed, but did not show osteomyelitis. Repeat MRI was not 
pursued as hand surgery did not think it would change 
management. Vascular surgery and hand surgery were consulted. 
Vascular surgery did not recommend intervention. Hand surgery 
felt his presentation was most likely consistent with dry 
gangrene related to his peripheral vascular disease and the 
fingers would likely self-demarcate/self-amputate. Pain was 
aggressively controlled with OxyCODONE (Immediate Release) 15 mg 
PO Q8H:PRN Pain on discharge. He was also started on gabapentin 
100 mg daily as adjuvant medication which discussed with the 
nephrology team.

#Atypical pneumonia
Found to incidentally have multifocal opacities on CTA chest per 
above. He was asymptomatic without leukocytosis, fever, cough. 
Differential diagnosis for the opacities included vasculitis 
given the above workup, however was ultimately felt to be most 
consistent with an atypical pneumonia. He received azithromycin

Tacrolimus was discontinued given limited benefit to graft and 
known side effect of vasoconstriction. 

# Immunosuppression
Continued prednisone 5mg daily. Prior to admission tacrolimus 
2.5mg BID which is vasoconstrictive, held after discussion with 
renal. Continued PCP ppx with ___ Suspension 750 mg PO 
DAILY. 

#Hypertension
Uptitrated nifedipine to 30 daily.

#Afib:
Labetolol switched to metoprolol succinate 50 daily last 
admission. Downtitrated metoprolol to 25 mg daily to decrase 
potential vasoconstriction.

speedy and uneventful recovery.

LOWER  EXTREMITY AMPUTATION (bilateral first hallux) 
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS

ACTIVITY 

You should keep your amputation site elevated whenever 
possible.It is very important that you put WEIGHT BEAR FOR 
ESSENTIAL DISTANCES ONLY UNTIL YOU ARE SEEN IN FOLLOW UP. 

MEDICATION

Before you leave the hospital, you will be given a list of all 
the medicine you should take at home.  If a medication that you 
normally take is not on the list or a medication that you do not 
take is on the list please discuss it with the team!  

You will likely be prescribed narcotic pain medication on 
discharge which  can be very constipating.  If you take 
narcotics,  please also take a stool softener such as Colace.   
If constipation becomes a problem, your pharmacist can suggest 
an additional over the counter laxative. 

You should take Tylenol ___ every 6 hours, as needed for 
pain.  If this is not enough, take your prescription narcotic 
pain medication.  You should require less pain medication each 
day.  Do not take more than a daily total of 3000mg of Tylenol.  
Tylenol is used as an ingredient in some other over-the-counter 
and prescription medications.  Be aware of how much Tylenol you 
are taking in a day.

BATHING/SHOWERING: 
You may shower when you feel strong enough but no tub baths or 
pools until you have permission from your surgeon and the 
incision is fully healed.  DO NOT SOAK YOUR INCISION.
After your shower, gently dry the incision well.   Do not rub 
the area. 

WOUND CARE:
Please keep the wound clean and dry. It is very important that 
there is no pressure on the wound.    If there is no drainage, 
you may leave the incision open to air.  

Your staples/sutures will remain in for at least 3 weeks.  At 
your followup appointment, we will see if the incision has 
healed enough to remove the sutures. 

CALL THE OFFICE FOR: ___
Opening, bleeding or drainage or odor from your wound incision 

Redness, swelling or warmth in your wound.
Fever greater than 101 degrees, chills, or worsening 
incisional/wound pain  

NO OTHER PROVIDER, EXCEPT YOUR VASCULAR SURGEON, SHOULD 
DETERMINE IF YOUR SUTURES ARE READY TO BE REMOVED FROM YOUR 
WOUND!   
IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS, THE PROVIDER SHOULD CALL THE 
VASCULAR SURGERY OFFICE AT ___ TO DISCUSS.   THE 
SUTURES WILL BE REMOVED IN THE OFFICE AT YOUR FOLLOWUP

History of Present Illness:
___ with history of myotonic dystrophy and cutaneous B-cell
lymphoma and PET-avid adenopathy without evidence of 
lymphomatous
nodal infiltration who is admitted for further management of
lymphomatous infiltration of his bilateral orbits. 

The patient has a history of decreased vision over the past 
three
months. He was last seen by his oncologist on ___ with plans for
6 month follow-up. He went to see his optometrist on ___ given
worsened visual acuity, and this was confirmed (OD ___, OS
___. He therefore saw an ophthalmologist, who noted proptosis
with periorbital edema, dilated temporal episcleral veins and
decreased vision. An MRI of the orbits was ordered given concern
for retro-orbital mass. This came back positive for findings
consistent with bilateral lymphomatous infiltration of his
orbits, and he was therefore sent to the ___ ED.

was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:
POD#2  Tm 102.9 overnight (11pm)), UA sent which was negative, 
no further fever workup pursued given pod#1 and has not been 
using IS nor ambulating much.  No pulmonary sx, no urinary sx, 
likely atelectasis and continued to monitor closely.
POD#3 was tachycardic to Tm 101.9 at 3am, tachy to 114, 95%2L 
denied sob/pleuritic chest pain, reported that uses O2 at home 
sometimes, no urinary sx, reports ear pain, no calf pain. 
Incision c/d/i with small area of ecchymosis/erythema.  
Cxr/ua/blood cultures ordered with close monitoring for any 
changes in symptoms and to determine need for further workup 
with PE CT if does not improve given fever/tachy/O2 requirement 
overnight. Also received 1u prbc for drop in hematocrit.
POD#4 Tachycardia improved s/p prbc transfusion, decreased O2 
requirement overnight, afebrile, chest x-ray shows decreased 
lung volume, ua negative. Remained afebrile and asymptomatic 
with no further O2 requirement throughout day, was mildly 
somnolent, but A&Ox3 and easily arousable.  Incision c/d/i with 
___ erythema. Otherwise pain well controlled and no 
acute symptoms 

Otherwise, pain was initially controlled with a PCA followed by 
a transition to oral pain medications on POD#1.  The patient 
received lovenox for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of 
POD#1.  The foley was removed on POD#2 and the patient was 
voiding independently thereafter. The surgical dressing was 
changed on POD#2 and the surgical incision was found to be clean 
and intact without erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient 
was seen daily by physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout 
the hospital course and repleted accordingly. At the time of 
discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling 
well.  The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The 
patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately 
controlled on an oral regimen. The operative extremity was 
neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign. 

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as 
tolerated on the operative extremity.

obstruction with a transition point in the right lower quadrant 
adjacent to ventral hernia repair mesh.  She was made NPO, had a 
NGT placed to low continuous wall suction and started on IVF.  
On HD1, the patient passed flatus and had minimal NGT output, so 
her NGT was removed. Her admission EKG showed new ST depressions 
in the anterior, left axis and troponins were sent which were 
negative. CXR was unremarkable. 

On HD2, the patient was advanced to a regular diet which was 
well-tolerated. The patient was ordered oxycodone for a 
migraine. The patient was later febrile to 103,  urinalysis, 
urine culture and blood culture were ordered.  There was no 
leukocytosis.  CXR was unremarkable.  

On HD3, the patient reported facial and ear pain and she was 
diagnosed with acute sinusitis.  Given her allergy to 
penicillin, she was started on Azithromycin.  The patient has a 
history of migraines and PO fioricet prn was started. A social 
work consult was placed to address her current housing and

IMPRESSION:  
CXR ___  
Right lower lobe focal opacity which could be pneumonia in the 
proper clinical setting.  Repeat after treatment suggested to 
document resolution. 

TTE ___
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal 
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). 
Doppler parameters are indeterminate for left ventricular 
diastolic function. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, 
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and 
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve 
leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is an 
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

Brief Hospital Course:
PATIENT SUMMARY
___ year old woman with a PMH DM, HTN, HLD, Asthma, and multiple 
abdominal surgeries after a complicated oophorectomy, who 
presents with 2 weeks worsening epigastric pain and acute kidney 
injury. She was resuscitated with fluids with subsequent 
resolution of ___. Given persistent abdominal pain concerning 
for PUD vs gastritis, she underwent endoscopy on ___ which 
showed patchy erythema. Biopsies were taken, and she was 
discharged with close GI and PCP ___. 

ACUTE ISSUES:
===============
#Abdominal Pain, possible dyspepsia
Patient presented with 2 weeks of epigastric pain, worse with 
meals, unrelieved by PPI therapy. She has a prolonged history of 
abdominal
surgeries following an oophorectomy with subsequent sigmoid 
perforation. On admission, CT showed no evidence SBO or 
pathology at her previous anastomosis. She was empirically 
treated with IV antibiotics over concern for intraabdominal 
infection. However, she remained afebrile with no leukocytosis, 
with overall low concern for infection, so antibiotics were 
stopped upon arrival to the floor. Recal occult blood test was 
negative. Her pain is likely secondary to gastritis vs peptic 
ulcer disease. 

GI was consulted for endoscopy given her history of gastritis 
and failure of a PPI trial. Endoscopy was performed on ___ and 
showed patchy erythema. Biopsies were taken, and patient will 
follow up in GI clinic with Dr. ___ (fellow). Her home 
omeprazole 20 mg PO BID was continued. Dicyclomine was changed 
to four times a day. H. pylori antibody testing was negative.

#Acute kidney injury
Creatinine was 2.3 on admission, likely secondary to pre-renal 
zotemia, ___ to hypovolemia in the setting of poor po intake 
from continued abdominal pain. Her Creatinine was 1.0 on 
discharge. Furosemide was held on admission and at discharge. 
Lisinopril was held on admission and restarted at discharge. 

CHRONIC PROBLEMS
================
# Pancytopenia: Stable throughout admission. 

# HTN: Furosemide was held on admission and at discharge. 
Lisinopril was held on admission and restarted at discharge. 

# HLD: Home simvastatin was continued.

# Chronic back pain: Gabapentin was continued at reduced renal 
dose until resolution of ___. Tylenol and Tramadol were given 
PRN. 

# Asthma:
Home regimen was continued: Fluticasone-Salmeterol Diskus, 
Fluticasone Propionate, Cetirizine and Montelukast.

# Psych: Home regimen was continued: Fluoxetine, Clonazepam, 
Quetiapine

# Diabetes Mellitus: Lantus 20 units in the morning and HISS 
were given in the hospital. Metformin, glipizide and sitagliptin 
were held. She will resume her home regimen. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
===================
[ ] Dicyclomine was increased to ___ need to be titrated
[ ] Follow up with PCP.
[ ] Evaluation of pancytopenia (ITP vs MDS vs other etiology)
[ ] Lasix held at discharge in setting of pre-renal ___, BPs 
were stable in the 110s-120s/60s-70s while in hospital. 
Re-evaluate BPs as outpatient and consider restarting Lasix vs 
adjusting regimen.

IMAGING:
========
CT Neck w/ contrast ___:
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. Partially visualized complex right suboccipital fluid without
complete rim enhancement, surrounded by soft tissue density, at
the site of prior subcutaneous edema.  This suggests a 
developing, though not fully formed abscess. 
2. Mildly enlarged, morphologically normal left lower posterior 
triangle/supraclavicular lymph nodes, contralateral from the
right suboccipital fluid collection, are most likely reactive,
but of uncertain etiology. 

CT HEAD W CONTRAST ___  
1. Scalp edema in the right occiput concerning for cellulitis. 
No
evidence of fluid collection or soft tissue gas.  
2. No acute intracranial abnormality.

Patient presented with ___ of worsening occipital scalp
tenderness and swelling, found to have a 3-4cm area consistent 
with cellulitis. Patient was febrile to 102.7 in the ED, 
otherwise was without leukocytosis (neutrophilic predominant, no 
bands). Given signs of possible systemic toxicity (fever, 
borderline BP upon arrival to the floor), continued MRSA in 
addition to strep coverage with vancomycin which was then 
transitioned to cefazolin.  Additionally, due to persistent 
fever on antibiotics as well as neck pain, a CT neck, and torso 
were obtained which showed emerging abcess. Abscess developed 
with purulent discharge. ACS was consulted and she underwent 
I&D. A She did well and antibiotics were narrowed to cephalexin 
to complete ten day course from day of I&D, end date ___. 

#NAUSEA AND ABDOMINAL PAIN:   
Patient has a history of multiple intraabdominal surgeries, 
additional GERD/gastritis (taking meloxicam daily). No BM for 
over 24 hours upon admission. The patient complained of 
worsening abdominal distention with associated nausea/emesis. 
Etiologies considered were bowel obstruction vs. PUD vs. 
evolving gastritis vs. SBP with known history of NASH +/- 
cirrhosis. Of note, patient was admitted ___ with abdominal 
pain and nausea/vomiting, symptoms thought to be related to 
gastritis/PUD. RUQUS without e/o ascites. KUB without evidence 
of ileus or obstruction. The morning that the day team picked up 
the patient, her abdominal exam was significantly improved and 
she only had mild tenderness to palpation. There were no further 
issues with this. 

#ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY:  
Cr was previously ~1, though increased to 1.3 ___ iso ED 
presentation for N/V/D. Suspected prerenal iso GI losses and 
poor PO intake, exacerbated by ongoing ACE-I and furosemide 
administration. No signs of UTI on UA. s/p 3L IVF in ED. Held 
home lisinopril and furosemide. After further IVF and stopping 
vancomycin the patient's ___ resolved.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

   It was a pleasure looking after you.  As you know, you were 
admitted with dizziness and back pain.  You were found to have a 
urinary tract infection which likely involved your kidney as 
well.  This may partly account for your back pain.   You were 
treated with intravenous antibiotics and switched to oral 
antibiotics once the urine cultures identified the bacteria 
(E.coli) and confirmed its sensitivity to the antibiotic you are 
being prescribed.
   
   Please complete the antibiotics (Cefpodoxime) for an 
additional 8 days to complete a 10 day course.  Otherwise, to 
avoid future urinary tract infection, please ensure that you are 
well hydrated and that your diabetes is in good control.  This 
will prevent future urinary tract infections from happening.  

 You were also found to be dehydrated and with mild acute kidney 
injury.  After hydration, your kidney function improved.  Please 
insure good oral intake of fluids and good control of sugars 
(higher sugars can lead to loss of water). 

 You may have a component of musculoskeletal back pain too.  For 
this, we recommend following with your medical doctor and taking 
acetaminophen (Tylenol) as needed. 

There are otherwise, no changes to your medication.  We wish you 
a quick recovery!

Your ___ team.

disease doctors and they recommended long term intravenous 
antibiotics to treat a possible bone infection. You had a PICC 
line placed for these antibiotics. It is important that you do 
not put weight on your right foot. You have been prescribed an 
increased dose of your oxycodone. Opiate pain medications can 
cause constipation, respiratory depression, can be addictive and 
can cause death. It is important that you take the lowest 
effective dose for the shortest time possible.

While you were in the hospital, you also had an abnormal heart 
rhythm. You had an ultrasound of your heart (Echo) which showed 
normal cardiac function. Your sotalol was stopped. You should 
follow up with your cardiologist.

# Oral surgery complicated by L submandibular and lateral 
pharyngeal space abscess s/p I&D of left submandibular and 
lateral pharyngeal spaces (___): patient was transferred from 
OSH due to development of neck cellulitis associated with airway 
compromise following an oral surgery procedure. She was taken to 
the OR by OMFS for I&D and drain placement n ___ and was 
transferred to the MICU following the procedure for airway 
monitoring. She was initiated on IV clindamycin/vancomycin. 
Following the procedure she became acutely hypertensive 
requiring IV medication. She was evaluated by ENT with 
fiberscope with findings notable for pharyngeal edema; she 
received decadron 10mg TID x1 day with resolution of edema on 
repeat fiberscope. Given stability, she was transferred to the 
floor. She tolerated an advanced diet. She was continued on 
peridex mouth rinse BID. She was re-evaluated by ___ and her 
drain was pulled on ___. She was transitioned to a po regimen 
of clindamycin with plan to complete x14 day course. 

#Chest pain, likely takotsubo's cardiomyopathy: patient was 
originally called out to the floor on ___ however prior to 
transfer she developed crushing substernal chest pain. She was 
started on nitro gtt and received high-dose aspirin, metoprolol, 
atorvastatin, and was started on a heparin gtt. ECG was notable 
for inferior and posterior ST-segment elevations and reciprocal 
depressions. Cardiology was consulted and the patient was sent 
from the MICU for cardiac catheterization on ___ which was 
notable for 50% occlusion of D1, no interventions. Given no 
occlusive lesions, and given clinical picture of sudden onset 
chest pain and associated septal hypokinesis on echo, this was 
consistent with takotsubo's cardiomyopathy vs vasospasm. The 
patient was transitioned to 81 mg aspirin, 80mg atorvastatin, 10 
mg Q8H nifidipine (for vasospasm) with goal SBP <140; 
beta-blockers were initially avoided given low HRs. Echo on ___ 
notable for septal hypokinesis, repeat ECG notable for TWI in 
V1-V2. Due to persistent hypertension with above regimen, she 
was transitioned to carvedilol 6.25mg BID. She was discharged on 
asa, statin, and carvedilol. 

#Hypoxia: Patient developed new O2 requirement on ___, requiring 
uptitration of NC from 2L to 4L on ___. Her lung exam was clear 
bilaterally. She underwent CXR on ___ without acute process, and 
CTA on ___ with no acute processes. Concern for atelectasis vs 
aspiration vs splinting. She used the incentive spirometer 
successfully and walked with ___. She was weaned off O2 and 
remained stable. 

#Diarrhea: during hospital course, patient developed large 
volume, watery BMs assoc with urgency. Differential inlcu 
antibiotic-induced vs c diff vs infectious. Stool cultures were 
negative for infection. 

#Orthostasis: patient c/o dizziness on ___, noted to have 
orthostatic hypotension. Thought to be ___ poor po intake. She 
received IVF boluses and her diet was advanced. She worked with 
___ and her dizziness resolved. 

#Hypertension: no history of HTN. However, post-op patient was 
noted to be hypertensive with SBPs in 200s, requiring IV 
labetalol. Due to concern for contribution of hypertension to 
MI, goal was to maintain SBP <140. She was originally started on 
nifedipine due to concern for low HR; she was transitioned to 
carvedilol 6.25mg BID with strict control. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===================================
#Hypothyroidism: she was continued on home levothyroxine.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to ___ due to swelling of your neck. An 
abscess, or pocket of infection, was found which was drained by 
the Oral Surgeons. The procedure went well; drain was placed 
into the abscess and you were started on antibiotics. You should 
continue to take clindamycin 300mg four times daily, your last 
day will be ___. You should continue Peridex mouth rinse 
swish and spit twice daily and change your dressing daily. You 
should continue to take Tylenol ___ up to four times daily for 
pain; please do not exceed 4gm per day as this can be bad for 
your liver.

After your procedure you were monitored in the Intensive Care

differentiation is preserved. There is no edema or mass effect. 
The 
ventricles are prominent in size consistent with age-related 
atrophic changes. 
Periventricular white matter hypodensities are consistent with 
small vessel ischemic disease. A focal hypodensity within the 
right basal ganglia likely represents a chronic lacune. 
Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. 

MRI/A HEAD AND NECK:
Area of subacute ischemia is identified involving the 
postero-lateral aspect of the left thalamus as described in 
detail above, 
visualized on the ADC, T2 and FLAIR sequences. 
  
Chronic microvascular ischemic changes with associated cortical 
volume loss as described in detail above. 
  
The area of ischemia also is involving the lateral aspect of the 
left 
thalamus. 

Limited examination with possible arteriosclerotic changes and 
narrowing of the distal branches of the MCA as described above. 
The left 
vertebral artery is patent as well as the basilar artery; 
however, the right vertebral artery is not clearly identified, 
possibly terminating in ___.  Hypoplasia of the A1 segment on 
the right is identified. 

CXR
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms ___ is a ___ year-old R-handed woman with
history of Alzheimer's dementia who presents with a 1 day 
history
of gait instability.  

# L THAMALMIC STROKE:

the right
side, overshooting on the right, rebound on the right, as well 
as
continued difficulties with ambulation with falling onto the the
right side.  Her NCHCT was negative for any acute processes
without any overt evidence of ischemia. Due to concern for 
stroke, she was admitted to neurology. MRI showed acute left 
thalamic infarct. MRA showed diffuse atherosclerosis with 
narrowing in distal MCAs but without any significant occlusive 
disease. The etiology of this small stroke is likely small 
vessel disease. The patient underwent a stroke workup including 
echocardiogram, toxic/metabolic studies, ___. 
She was started on ASA 325 mg and simvastatin. Her fasting lipid 
panel showed total cholesterol 224, HDL 60, LDL 125 and 
triglycerides 194.
She was monitored on telemetry and had no arrhythmias. 

# UTI:
Positive UA, Ucx for E coli, pansensitive, completed ___actrim for uncomplicated UTI.

Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
 
History of Present Illness:
Patient is a ___ year old woman with history of benign pancreatic 
lipomatosis, peripheral neuropathy, hx of osteomyelitis s/p BKA, 
osteoarthritis, history of Nissen fundoplication, prior 
pancreatitis, who presents with abdominal pain for 1 day.

Patient reports she initially developed an episode of acute 
abdominal pain during an admission for her BKA in ___. She 
reports the pain started after receiving morphine for LLE pain. 
CT scan at that time demonstrated lipomatosis of the pancreas at 
the time. The acute pain resolved and since then patient has had 
intermittent episodes of dull epigastric abdominal pain, not 
related to meals or activity, that were mild at best and never 
led to hospitalizations. Patient also reports two 
hospitalizations for ""non specific hepatitis"", one at ___ 
___ which was attributed to an ""experimental medication"" 
she was on but could not recall, and the second one in ___ 
with no clear cause found.

She reports she drinks about 1 glass of wine per night, but 2 
nights prior to admission, she drank ___ glasses as it was her 
son's birthday. She then developed severe RUQ/epigastric pain 
radiating to the back. No nausea, vomiting, fever, chills. She 
also reports diarrhea for the past 2 days that preceded the 
abdominal pain, as well as URI sxs for the past week. She denied 
jaundice.

She initially presented to ___ where labs showed 
elevated lipase. CT abd showed chronic fatty change along the 
inferior posteriod edge of the pancreatic head, present since 
___. Transferred to ___ ER.

In the ED, initial VS were: 98.6 75 152/67 16 95% RA 
ED labs were notable for: ALT: 341 AP: 173 AST: 430 Lip: 578
Utox pos for barbiturates, and opiates
 Imaging showed CXR without any acute process

Patient was given:
___ 20:46 IV HYDROmorphone (Dilaudid) 1 mg 
___ 20:46 IV Ondansetron 4 mg 
___ 20:46 IVF 1000 mL LR 1000 mL 
___ 22:33 IV DiphenhydrAMINE 50 mg 

When seen on the floor, she reports significant pruritus after 
receiving the dilaudid for which she was given Benadryl. She 
reports this is a chronic problem for her. She also reported her 
abdominal pain had resolved with the dilaudid, however she was 
experiencing RLE pain at the site of her BKA, as well as in her 
LLE. She reports she has a chronic history of peripheral 
neuropathy, however her leg pain had worsened since she suffered 
a mechanical fall about a week ago.

osteoarthritis, history of Nissen fundoplication, who presents 
with abdominal pain for 1 day.

# Acute pancreatitis
Patient has a questionable history of pancreatitis in ___ that 
developed after receiving morphine which raises suspicion for 
sphincter of oddi dysfunction. Since then she has been doing 
well with no admissions for pancreatitis until now. She now 
presents with epigastric pain radiating to back with elevated 
lipase above 3x ULN, consistent with pancreatitis. CT did not 
show any evidence of pancreatitis, however not always 
informative in early pancreatitis. Etiology is most likely due 
to alcohol intake. She is s/p CCY. She denies any abdominal 
trauma. She is not on steroids, and her triglycerides are 
normal. The patient was managed with bowel rest and IV fluids. 
Her pain resolved quickly an her diet was advanced which she 
tolerated without pain. She was counseled on alcohol cessation. 

# Transaminitis: Prior history of ""non specific hepatitis"". She 
currently has LFT pattern consistent with hepatocellular injury 
likely due to ETOH intake. Should have repeat LFTs at PCP follow 
up.

History of Present Illness:
___ woman with history of IVDU, MRSA tricuspid 
endocarditis (___) s/p 4-wk course of IV daptomycin now 
being admitted for transthoracic echocardiogram. Per the ED 
history, patient was arrested earlier on evening of admission 
when she was caught using heroin with her boyfriend. She was 
then incarcerated, and upon discovering that the cost of bail 
was ___, she developed chest and back pain and was transferred 
to ___ emergency room. (Speaking with patient this morning, 
she denies heroin or cocaine use; she says that she had an 
unlabeled bottle of pills that contained gabapentin and ""some 
Klonopin"" and that this was the cause for her incarceration - 
she says that earlier in the day she was taking Klonopin but 
otherwise denies illicits yesterday; last heroin use was 3 days 
ago.)  

In the ED, initial vitals were T 98.6, HR 88, BP 117/69, RR 12, 
satting 100%RA. Labs showed a hct of 29.8, which is unchanged 
from her recent baseline. CBC and BMP were otherwise 
unremarkable. Cardiac enzymes were negative x1 set. EKG was 
unchanged. CXR showed no acute process. ED staff noted focal 
tenderness over her right lower back and was concerned about 
septic arthritis of the sacroiliac joint versus psoas abscess. 
For this reason, patient underwent CT scan of the ___ 
that showed no evidence of acute infection (see preliminary 
report below). Blood cultures were drawn. Patient was then 
admitted for a TTE that had been previously scheduled for ___.  


Of note, patient underwent a 4-week treatment course for MRSA 
tricuspid endocarditis with IV daptomycin that ended in mid ___. 
Previously, she had been evaluated by thoracic surgery as there 
was concern about tricuspid vegetations and ASD (both seen on 
her TEE), and the risk for paradoxical embolism. Thoracics had 
recommended for TTE in four weeks to re-evaluate valves (see 
note from ___. The original follow-up TTE had been scheduled 
for ___, and as it turned out patient had been re-admitted to 
___ again on ___ for somnolence in the setting of urine 
tox positive for cocaine and opioids. During that admission, 
after she cleared from what was thought to be drug-related 
somnolence, patient insisted on leaving the hospital and refused 
to have the TTE done. She ended up leaving AMA.  

Patient is now being admitted to have the follow-up TTE done. 
Emergency room staff has confirmed that she is willing to 
undergo the study during this admission.  

Review of Systems: currently, patient complains of right lower 
back pain. Her chest pain, which she attributes to stress, has 
resolved.

Studies:

___: CT Abdomen/Pelvis: 
1. Cavitary nodule at the right lung base in keeping with 
patient's history of septic emboli. 
2. Cystic structure in the pelvis measuring 5 cm similar to 
prior could be a paraovarian cyst; however cannot exclude 
endometrioma since no change in size about two months. Pelvic 
ultrasound is recommended to evaluate this finding further. 
Small amount of free fluid in the pelvis. D/w Dr. ___ at 
10:13 am on ___. 
3. Hypodensity at the cervix, could be a Garthner's cyst. 
4. Hypodensities in the right kidney too small to be 
characterized, likely 
simple cysts. 
5. Small hypodensity at L1-L2 on the right could be a small 
perineural cyst. 

___: CXR: 1. Stable blunting of the right costophrenic 
angle, likely scarring, with minimal blunting of the left 
costophrenic angle. 
2. Opacity at the right lung base corresponds to the small 
cavitation seen on CT abdomen and pelvis from the same night. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female with history of polysubstance abuse, recent 
MRSA endocarditis s/p 4 weeks of daptomycin, who presented with 
chest and back pain in the setting of incarceration for IV drug 
possession.  She left against medical advice.

#. History of recent tricuspid endocarditis: She is status-post 
a 4-week course of daptomycin, observed at the ___.  She 
was admitted for repeat TTE, as she was scheduled for a repeat 
TTE a few weeks ago and missed her appointment.  However, she 
was admitted on a weekend and refused to wait until ___ when 
TTE could be performed.  She therefore left against medical 
advice.

#. Back pain and chest pain: She had developed chest pain and 
back pain in the setting of being handcuffed and riding in the 
police car. ECG and CXR were unremarkable for acute process.  
Her chest pain completely resolved.  She continued to complain 
of right-sided lower back pain that she reports had been chronic 
for a few months and exacerbated by a MVA last week.  She denied 
any recent fevers, weakness, saddle anesthesia, or bowel or 
bladder incontinence.  She was treated with prn Tylenol and 
Motrin.
 
#. Ongoing polysubstance abuse:  She presented in the setting of 
an arrest for IV drug possession.   She would likely benefit 
from methadone maintenance therapy and it was ensured that she 
had the contact information for a clinic prior to her leaving 
against medical advice.

#. Paraaortic cystic mass: She had a CT abdomen/pelvis in the ED 
which showed a 5cm  cystic structure in her pelvis similar to 
prior imaging.  It was felt that endometrioma could not be 
excluded and pelvic ultrasound was recommended.  She left 
against medical advice before pelvic ultrasound was obtained.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with a history of IVDU who 
initially presented to ___ with several days 
of generalized malaise, fever to 102 and with what she thought 
was a flu-like illness. She was also complaining of anorexia, 
dysuria, nausea with some vomitting and right sided chest pain 
that worsened with deep inspiration and with any movement. In 
the ER there she was found to have leukocytosis of 21.7, with 
83% PMN's and 5% bands. She was also found to be hyponatremic to 
127, creatinine of 1.48, INR of 2 with a t. bili of 1.2. Her tox 
screen was positive for cocaine and opiate metabolites. A chest 
x-ray showed a right sided wedge shaped, possible infiltrate, so 
initially it was thought that that she had a UTI, PNA and signs 
of liver failure. She was initially admitted to ___ 
___ on ___.
.
After her admission multiple sets of blood cultures became 
positive for MRSA and there was concern that she had 
endocarditis. An echocardiogram was done that showed severe 
tricuspid insufficiency, with TR, and a vegetation that measured 
1cm x 0.6cm. A CT scan that was done to follow up her chest 
x-ray findings, showed bilateral focal pneumonia and nodular 
consolidation compatible with septic emboli. During her course 
she also developed bilateral otitis media. She was initially 
treated with vancomycin, reportedly with appropriate levels but 
then complained of hearing deficits so her antibiotic coverage 
was changed to linezolid. Most recent blood cultures from 
___ are positive for MRSA, as a result of her continued 
bacteremia it was decided that she would benefit from a tansfer 
to ___ further evaluation and treatment.
.
On the floor, her initial VS were: 99.3, 122/78, 66, 24, 97% on 
___. She is currently c/o lung/rib pain, SOB and left hip pain 
that shoots down the back of her legs. She says that the last 
time she used drugs was on ___. She denies any withdrawal 
symptoms, fever/chills, n/v/d, abdominal pain.

.
CT Torso: IMPRESSION: 
1. Numerous bilateral cavitary nodules throughout the lung 
parenchyma. Given
the patient's history of endocarditis, these findings are most 
consistent with
septic emboli, expected to be from the right heart.
2. No evidence of infarcts or abscesses within the visceral 
organs of the
abdomen or pelvis.
3. Two cystic lesions in the left adnexa, one of which is within 
the left
ovary and the second larger lesion likely representing an 
exophytic or
paraovarian cyst. A followup ultrasound in six weeks is 
recommended to
document resolution.
4. Hepatomegaly and borderline splenomegaly. Correlation with 
LFTs and
clinical history is recommended.
.
TEE: Conclusions
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. A 
very small left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum 
consistent with a small secundum atrial septal defect is present 
at rest. A catheter is seen in the right atrium near the 
tricuspid valve. Overall left ventricular systolic function is 
normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic 
valve. No aortic valve abscess is seen. The mitral valve appears 
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass 
or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. No mitral valve 
abscess is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There are two echodense structures on the tricuspid 
valve (probably on the anterior leaflet) consistent with 
moderate sized vegetations, each measuring approximately 1.1 
centimeters by 0.5 centimeters. Moderate eccentric tricuspid 
regurgitation. No abscess is visualized. There is no pericardial 
effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Two moderate sized tricuspid valve vegetations 
measuring 1.1 cm by 0.5 cm on the tricuspid valve. Moderate 
eccentric tricuspid regurgitation. No abscess of the tricuspid 
valve. Catheter tip visualized in the right atrium near the 
tricuspid valve. Recommend withdrawing the catheter 2 to 3 
centimeters to minimize risk of trauma to the tricuspid valve.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
 Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o female with a h/o regular ___ 
transferred from ___ with right sided MRSA 
endocarditis with persistently positive blood cultures
.
#) Endocarditis: she was transferred with a report of 
intermittently positive blood cultures for MRSA, a large 1x0.6cm 
vegetation on her tricuspid valve along with septic emboli in 
her lungs.  At the time of admission there was concern that she 
remained persistently bacteremic despite over a week of IV 
antibiotics.  Infectious disease was consulted and recommended 
removal of her PICC line, daily surveillance blood cultures, a 
TEE and continued treatment with linezolid pending daptomycin 
sensitivities.  After removal of her PICC line, all of her blood 
cultures drawn at ___ were negative, which was concerning for 
possible seeding of the PICC line causing continued positive 
blood cultures at the OSH.  In order for daptomycin 
sensitivities to be done a culture of the MRSA was transferred 
from ___ to the microbiology lab at ___ for 
daptomycin sensitivity testing, after the determination that the 
MRSA was sensitive to daptomycin her antibiotic coverage was 
changed to daptomycin.  On ___ she underwent a TEE that 
showed two moderate sized (1.1cmx0.5cm)  vegetations on her 
tricuspid valve, a small ASD,  but did find any evidence of an 
abscess or left sided involvement.  After the TEE was done 
cardiac surgery was consulted to answer the question about need 
for possible ASD repair, given the concern for possible 
embolization of part of the vegetation that could cross to the 
left side of the heart.  After evaluation by cardiac surgery 
they felt that she did not need a surgical intervention at this 
time but would need a repeat echocardiogram in ___ weeks.  At 
the time of discharge she needed to complete a 4 week course of 
IV daptomycin that began on ___.  
.
#) Pneumonia/Septic Emboli: per OSH records, CT scan with 
multiple septic emboli, nodular opacities and infiltrates and 
she initially had a 4L oxygen requirement.  At the time of 
admission a CT scan of her torso was done that showed numerous 
bilateral cavitary pulmonary nodules consistent with septic 
emboli.  As she was continued on her IV antibiotics her oxygen 
requirement and pulmonary status improved, to the point that she 
no longer had an oxygen requirement and her dyspnea was 
significantly improved.  
.
#) IV Drug Use: Patient with a history of IV heroin and cocaine 
use, up until the day prior to her admission at ___ 
___.  She was started on clonidine for help with her 
withdrawal symptoms.  With her history of IVDU and hepatitis C, 
all hepatitis serologies were checked as was HIV.  Her HIV was 
negative, and her hepatitis serologies showed that she was 
immune to hepatitis B but not A.  She was seen by social work 
who gave her information about outpatient treatment programs and 
she endorsed a desire to try to stop IV drug use after her 
discharge.  With a PICC in place she was screened for rehab 
placement, as she would not be able to leave the hospital with a 
PICC in place.  
.
#) Hepatitis C: Patient with h/o untreated Hep C, presumably 
from IVDU, this was confirmed by a positive Hepatitis C 
antibody, but her viral load was negative.  Given that she was 
not immune to hepatitis A, she was given the first vaccine in 
the Hep A series on ___, she will need to complete the 
series as an outpatient. 
.
#) Decreased Hearing: A few days into her hospital stay at 
___ she developed decreased hearing, which was thought to be 
due to combination of a bilateral otitis media and vancomycin 
ototoxicity.  In the hospital she was seen by ENT who felt that 
she had conductive hearing loss due to cerumen impaction.  After 
colace to help soften the ear wax, it was still unable to be 
removed, so she was set up with an outpatient ENT appointment 
for removal of the impacted cerumen.

intoxication, especially given urinary toxicology screen 
positive for cocaine and opiates.  The patient was somnolent for 
most of her stay in the emergency department; when she was 
admitted to the medical floor she woke up and requested to leave 
the hospital.  She denied any illicit drug use and stated that 
she was unwilling to stay in the hospital for her TTE (which had 
been scheduled for ___ to monitor resolution of her 
endocarditis).  The patient was A&Ox3 and felt to have capacity 
to make decisions.  The medical team and social worker were 
unable to convince the patient to remain in the hospital in 
order to monitor for signs of recurrent infection and/or 
withdrawal.  The patient stated her understanding that she could 
have a serious infection that could be life-threatening, and 
left the hospital AMA.  She was not willing to remain in the 
hospital long enough to reschedule her echocardiogram or 
follow-up of her ovarian cyst.

Imaging:

MRI/A head/neck: ___
IMPRESSION: 
  
1. Subacute medial right cerebellar hemisphere infarct in the 
distribution of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. 
  
2. Probable thrombus within the V3 and V4 segments of the right 
vertebral 
artery; however, dissection cannot be definitively excluded. 
Recommend CTA of the neck for further evaluation. 
  
3. Sinus disease as decribed above, the activity of which is to 
be determined 
clinically. 
  
Echo ___:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The 
interatrial septum is aneurysmal. A left-to-right shunt across 
the superior portion of the interatrial septum is seen at rest 
c/w a secundum type atrial septal defect. Multiple fenestrations 
are suggested (clip 94) There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic 
function (LVEF>55%). Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging 
suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left 
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right 
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall 
contractility. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus 
level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal 
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no 
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Atrial septal defect with prominent left-to-right 
flow and dilated right ventricle suggesting a signicant 
intracardiac shunt. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild symmetric 
left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional 
biventricular systolic function. Dilated ascending aorta.
If clinically indicated, a TEE would be best able to better 
define the interatrial septum. A cardiac MRI would be best able 
to quantify the intracardiac shunt.

Lower extremity dopplers (___):
IMPRESSION: No evidence of bilateral lower extremity DVT.

CTA head/neck ___

IMPRESSION: 
  
1. Hyperdense distal right vertebral artery on pre-contrast 
images which does 
not opacify, likely secondary to thrombus as seen on prior MRA. 
Lack of 
appropriate opacification secondary to previously described 
technical failure 
limits the ability of the current examination to determine 
whether a right 
vertebral artery dissection is present. Repeat examination with 
contrast 
injection into the right upper extremity may be helpful for 
further 
evaluation. 
  
2. Right cerebellar infarct as seen on prior MRI. 
  
Findings discussed with Dr. ___ at 04:45 p.m. on ___. 
  
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist. 

  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a ___ right handed previously healthy 
male transferred from OSH with acute right cerebellar infarct in 
territory of right ___.  He presented to OSH after having an 
episode of dizziness, sweating, and nausea and vomiting.  He 
also had a feeling of being too weak to walk.   His neurologic 
exam is normal with the exception of very subtle dysmetria on 
the R side.  While at the OSH, after the administration of a 
nitro patch the patient developed an occiptal headache that was 
constant, with some relief with NSAIDs and tylenol.  

He was transferred to the ___ ICU, for concern about 
verterbral artery dissection and concern for possible edema in 
the posterior fossa.  A MRI/MRA was obtain that confirmed the 
location of a cerebellar infarct.  The MRA showed an occluded 
right vertebral artery.  It could not be determined from the fat 
suppression images if there was just an occlusion of the 
vertebral artery or a dissection.  An echo was also obtained 
which showed a moderate ASD with left to right shunting, with 
some dilation of the right ventricle.  Given this finding and 
the concern for a possible dissection, the decision was made to 
start the patient on a heparin drip with a bridge to coumadin.  
The patient did not have evidence on lower extremity doppler of 
any DVT.  A hyper coagulable workup was initiated.  He had 
negative dopplers of his lower extremities.  A follow up CTA was 
performed but the contrast was injected on the left side, and 
there was not significant enough flow to get a good image of the 
right vertebral artery. 

Cardiology was consulted and determined that the ASD would meet 
criteria for repair.  However they wanted to delay this repair 
until the patient has had his full course of coumadin.

The patient was transferred out of the unit to the floor on 
___. He was closely monitored on floor. He was started on 
lovenox injections for anticoagulation and put on coumadin, with 
goal INR of ___. He was advised to stop lovenox once the INR 
becomes therapeutic and follow with primary care doctor for dose 
adustemnt of couamdin. LDL was high 130 and he was started on 
simvastatin for that. He was advised to follow with cardiology 
for further management of ASD.

He was seen by physical therapy who suggested outpatient ___ for 
gait and functional stability for few days. His exam at 
discharge was significant for very mild cerebellar signs on 
right side.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to an outside hospital with an episode of 
vertigo, nausea, vomiting and ataxia.  At the outside hospital 
you were found to have a stroke on the right side of your 
cerebellum.  You also developed a mild headache.  You were 
transferred to the ___ intensive care unit for further workup. 
 Here you had imiaging that confirmed you stroke.  Imaging of 
your blood vessels showed that there was a blockage of your 
right vertebral artery (on of the arteries that supplies your 
brain).  We could not determine if it was just blocked or there 
was a tear in the vessel

By the time you arrived in our ICU, your symptoms had largely 
resolved.  You were left with a very subtle problem with 
coordination on your right side. You were transfered to floor 
and started on Lovenox injections and coumadin , a blood 
thinner. You will be stopping lovenox injections once your INR 
becomes ___.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. ___ is a ___
male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma admitted today to
begin cycle 1 week one high-dose IL-2 therapy. His oncologic
history began in ___ when he was diagnosed with a left renal
cell carcinoma and underwent radical nephrectomy. Pathologic
evaluation revealed a 7-cm mass, grade 2 extending to the
renal capsule, felt to be clear cell type. Following surgery,
he was followed clinically until ___ when a left
lower lobe lung nodule was discovered on routine CAT scan. He
underwent a VATS procedure and resection in ___
with metastatic renal cell carcinoma noted. Routine scans in
___ again revealed pulmonary recurrence for which he
underwent resection in ___. He developed bilateral
PEs in ___ but was otherwise well until
recently when a CAT scan in ___ revealed multiple
pulmonary nodules as well as 2 bony lesions in L3 and T10 and
possibly a new liver lesion. He was referred here in ___ for
consideration for IL-2 therapy. Of note, pathology reviewed
here revealed chromophobe histology. He developed wheezing
and stridor in ___ with ENT evaluation revealing
thickening below the vocal cords with biopsy showing chronic
lung inflammation. He was later found to have a mass in this
region and had a tracheostomy performed on ___ with
improvement in symptoms. He had PFTs performed with trache in

hemoptysis. There was no recent deep suctioning and no 
supratheraputic INR. Pt was admitted to medicine service for 
close monitoring. He was continued on his Coumadin, as the 
bleeding has appeared to stabilize, his CXR did not show 
evidence of gross hemorrhage, his breathing has remained stable 
without SOB. His routine of induced cough to clear secretions 
was held initially to allow further stabilization of the site of 
bleeding, which may be due to lung metastasis and trauma from 
cough. He was treated with humidified oxygen. During the 
hospitalization, he did cough up an additional small amount of 
blood, but the blood did not appear to be very new, and was 
mixed with sputum, likely from the prior bleed. He did feel that 
he was becoming congested, after skipping his routine of induced 
cough, so he performed his induced cough routine while monitored 
in the hospital to ensure safety. With this, he coughed up a 
large, thick sputum, with NO blood present.  Pt was encouraged 
to decrease this routine from BID to q day for the next few days 
while the bleed site further stabilizes, and he was instructed 
to return to the hospital emergently if he has an episode of 
rebleed. He has follow up with Oncology scheduled for ___.  
.  
If he has a significant rebleed, with gross hemoptysis, he may 
require either brochoscopy and/or ___ embolization.

___ CXR: Innumerable pulmonary nodules, relatively stable 
compared to next preceding CT, compatible with metastases. No 
focal opacification concerning for pneumonia. 
.
___ Admission CT Head: New intraparenchymal hemorrhage with 
surrounding edema and mass effect centered on previous left 
median occipital lobe metastasis. 
.
___ Repeat CT Head: 1. Stable left occipital intraparenchymal 
hemorrhage with stable edema and mass effect. 
.
___: Duplex U/S bilaterally: No evidence of DVT in the right 
or left lower extremity.
.
___: MR HEAD: IMPRESSION: The left parietooccipital 
hemorrhage is grossly similar in size compared with the CT of 
the head performed ___. The surrounding mass effect 
is not significantly changed. The ventricles are stable in size 
and are not enlarged. The post-contrast sequence does not 
demonstrate other foci of post-contrast T1 hyperintensity within 
the brain parenchyma to suggest other lesion. The hemorrhage 
produces intrinsic T1 hyperintensity which could mask underlying 
enhancing lesion as seen on the prior MRI in ___ of this 
year. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old man with metastatic renal cell carcinoma admitted 
with progressive headaches and right hemanopsia and found to 
have worsening hemorrhagic mass in the left parietal/occipital 
region and admitted to the ICU for medical management.
.
# Hemorrhagic brain metastasis: Patient with renal cell 
carcinoma, known brain metastasis, and currently on Lovenox for 
anticoagulation. Head CT on admission was remarkable for an 
enlarged edematous and hemorrhagic mass extending into the 
occipital and parietal lobes, which explained right homonymous 
hemianopsia. Anticoagulation was stopped and Neurosurgery was 
was consulted, who recommended no intervention until greater 
than 2 weeks after his last dose of Avastin. He was admitted to 
the FICU and monitored with serial neuro checks. Head CT was 
repeated which showed no progression for hemorrheage/edema. His 
blood pressure was initially controlled with a Nicardipine gtt 
(goal sBP 120-140) and his head of bed was maintained >30 
degrees. Repeat CT head imaging was stable. Per Neuro-Oncology 
he was started on Nimodipine for prevention of vasospasm, Keppra 
for seizure prophylaxis, and his Dexamethasone was decreased 
from 6 mg to 4 mg q6h. He remained stable and was transferred to 
the OMED service for further management.  His Dexamethasone was 
tapered and he was discharged on Dexamethasone 4mg Daily.  
Repeat MRI on ___ showed stable intracranial process.  On 
___ he had an episode of hypertension and was otherwise 
asymptomatic.  He was restarted on his home medications - 
hydrochlorothiazide 25mg PO daily and metoprolol tartrate 50mg 
PO BID.  His nimodipine was changed to PRN, but he did not 
require any doses and was not continued at the time of 
discharge.  His Right Homonymous hemianopsia persisted and is 
not expected to resolve.
.
# Increased intracranial pressure: Patient complained of 
worsening headache on admission and was bradycardic and 
hypertensive ___ components of ___ triad). HOB was 
maintained >30. Headache improved and experienced no change in 
neurologic examination to suggest herniation or increased ICP. 
Bradycardia and hypertension resolved. 
.
# Hypertension: Given concern for acute hemorrheage we aimed to 
maintain SBP 120-140. This was initially achieved with a 
Nicardipine gtt, which was turned off on hospital day 2. He was 
also initially continued on his outpatient Metoprolol Tartrate 
50 BID, which was held in the setting of starting Nimodipine for 
vasospasm to prevent relative hypotension.  On ___ he had an 
episode of hypertension and was otherwise asymptomatic.  He was 
restarted on his home medications - hydrochlorothiazide 25mg PO 
daily and metoprolol tartrate 50mg PO BID.  His nimodipine was 
changed to PRN, but he did not require any doses and was not 
continued at the time of discharge.  
.
# Pulmonary embolisms: Patient has a history of recurrent 
pulmonary emboli, and was previously anticoagulated with 
warfarin and then changed to Lovenox ___. Given hemorrhagic 
brain mets, future anticoagulation is contraindicated. Bilateral 
lower extremity ultrasounds were negative for DVT. He underwent 
placement of an IVC filter on ___ by Interventional Radiology 
to prevent future clot propogation. 
.
# Hemoptysis: Possibly related to multiple pulmonary metastasis 
in the setting of anitcoagulation. New pulmonary embolism is 
unlikely given absence of tachycardia or hypoxia. He was 
provided with humidified oxygen. His O2 saturations remained 
adequate on room air. 
.
# Acute on Chronic Kidney disease: Baseline Cr appears to be 
1.3-1.4. The patient's Cr was at baseline on admission, and 
increased in the setting of diuresis. He was bolused 500 cc of 
NS and repeat electrolytes revealed improvement in creatinine.  
His creatinine remained stable for the rest of his hospital 
stay. 
.
# Hyponatremia: Thought to be secondary to SIADH given 
underlying intracranial and pulmonary disease. Serum cortisol 
was normal. Urine lytes revealed sodium avidity with a highly 
concentrated urine, likely a mixed picture (dehydration with 
underlying SIADH). He was given IVFs with subsequent improvment 
in sodium.  At the time of discharge his Na was 136.
.
# Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma: Patient diagnosed with RCC 
after biopsy of metastatic pulmonary lesion. He has metastatic 
involvment of brain, spinal cord, lungs and larynx. In ___ he 
was treated with tracheostomy for laryngeal mass. Admission 
chest xray showed worsening of pulmonary metastatic disease.  
His hemorrhagic brain mass has been well controlled with steroid 
therapy.  He has stabilized since admission and is doing well.  
He will continue to receive dexamethasone in the outpatient 
setting and follow up with his outpatient oncologists.
.
# Chronic low back pain with neuropathy: Patient is on 
gabapentin and oxydonone for chronic low back pain and 
neuropathy. Gabapentin was initially held on admission to avoid 
sedating medications and pain was controled with oxycodone + 
oxycontin at home dose.  His pain was relatively well controlled 
and his gabapentin was restarted at the time of discharge.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: A ___ year-old male with metastatic renal 
cell carcinoma w/ recent admission for hemorrhage or metastatic 
brain mass p/w syncopal episode likely ___ drug effect 
complicated by vasovagal event.
.  
# Syncope:  There was initial concern for medication induced 
syncope coupled with orthostasis.  His metoprolol was 
discontinued in order to ensure we are not blocking a 
physiologic tachycardia and we also stopped terazosin 5mg PO 
QHS.  We started lisinopril 5mg PO daily for blood pressure 
control.  He was encouraged to drink a lot of fluid overnight 
and he was asymptomatic overnight with no events on telemetry.  
BP has been stable on the new regiment of hydrochlorothiazide 
and lisinopril.  Orthostatics were negative and creatinine has 
trended back to baseline.  EEG was negative to rule out seizure 
activiity.  He was conitnued on his keppra.  He was scheduled to 
go back to Rehab, but after much conversation it was decided 
that he would go home to hospice.    
.  
# Chronic low back pain with neuropathy: Patient is on 
gabapentin and oxydonone for chronic low back pain and 
neuropathy.  His pain had been difficult to control and after an 
after a night with a pain crisis, and development of urinary 
retention we got a MRI of the L spine to rule out cord 
compression.  The patient had known mets in the area, but there 
was no signs of cord compression.  His medications were titrated 
up and he was eventually discharged on oxycontin 40mg PO Q12H, 
Oxycodone ___ PO Q4H:PRN and gabapentin 300mg ___ and 
500mg QHS.  His pain was much better controlled on this 
regiment. 
.
# Metastatic renal cell: Patient diagnosed with RCC after biopsy 
of metastatic pulmonary lesion. He has metastatic involvment of 
brain, spinal cord, lungs and larynx. In ___ he was treated 
with tracheostomy for laryngeal mass. Admission chest x-ray 
shows worsening of pulmonary metastatic disease and also with 
brain mets that recently hemorrhaged, but is now stable.  CT 
scan in the ED showed stable brain lesion.  EEG was done to rule 
out seizure related to hemorrhagic mass.  He was continued on 
keppra 500mg PO BID and dexamethasone 5mg PO Daily.  He was also 
continued on Avastin as scheduled.  
.
# Bilateral DVT: While in house the patient developed right 
lower extremity edema.  His RLE was tense, but pulses were 
dopplerable.  Duplex U/S showed Extensive right lower extremity 
DVT from calf.  vascular was consulted and given the 
extensiveness of the clot and inability to anti-coagulate given 
recent sub-dural hemmorhage that conservative management was the 
best option.  Compression stocking and ACE wrap and elevation of 
the right leg significantly improved the edema and pain.  A 
pneumoboot was placed on his left leg for DVT prevention, but 2 
days later he developed LLE swelling and repeat U/S showed 
extensive clot on the left.  It was treated similarly to the 
right.
.
# Goals Of Care: At the beginning of this admission, the plan 
was to stabilize the patient's syncopal symptoms and discharge 
back to Rehab.  After the developments of extensive bilateral 
clots, we had a goals of care discussion with his family.  He 
initially wanted to speak with his priest prior to making any 
decisions.  However, the following day, he decided to make 
himself DNR/DNI and wanted a palliative care consult.

Brief Hospital Course:
#Sepsis secondary to pyelonephritis
Mrs. ___ presented with pyelonephritis in the setting of 
recent nephrolithiasis s/p recent stenting and subsequent stent 
removal on ___. The patient was seen by Dr. ___ at 
___ on ___ who recomended lithotripsy and stenting at that 
time in the setting of her known nephrolithiasis. U/S showed 
persistent residual caliectasis for which she underwent 
cystoscopy and left distal ureteroscopy on ___. This did not 
reveal residual stone, rather a left ureterovesicular 
stricture/edema which was stented (6 x ___ double J). 
Impression was that she had ureteral stenosis/stricture as the 
result of an impacted UPJ stone. 

The stent was subsequently removed on ___ after which the 
patient presented to the ED with signs and symptoms concerning 
for pyelonephritis. Repeat CT A/P Non-Con (___) showed no 
evidence of nephrolithiasis, mild L. hydroureter w/ adjacent fat 
stranding (expected in setting of recent L. ureteral surgical 
manipulation) and no hydronephrosis. The patient was admitted 
for sepsis secondary to non-obstructing pyelonephritis and 
started on IV ceftriaxone initially. Following culture results 
with evidence of enteroccoccus growth the patient was 
transitioned to IV ampicillin. Upon clinical stabilization the 
patient was transitioned to oral augmentin to complete a full 10 
day course on discharge.

valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. Significant 
aortic stenosis is present (not quantified). Moderate to severe 
(3+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet 
is eccentric, directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet. The 
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Torn mitral 
chordae are present. An eccentric jet of Moderate to severe (3+) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

phenylepphrine infusion s/p AVR, mitral ring, and ascending 
aorta repair. 
Left ventricular function is improved in the setting of 
ionotropic support with an estimated EF 45%. The septum is 
hypokinetic with mild dyskinesis. 
There is a well seated bioprosthetic aortic valve. There are no 
perivalular leaks. The peak and mean gradients are 36/14mmHg at 
a CO of 6.5.
There is a well seated mitral annuloplasty ring.. The mitral 
regurgitation is significantly improved - now trace. Peak and 
mean gradients are ___ mmHg at a CO of 6.5.

operating room on ___ where the patient underwent AVR (25mm 
tissue), MVrepair (32mm ring), and Ascending Aorta Replacement 
(28mm gelweave graft) with Dr. ___.  Overall the patient 
tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was 
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and 
invasive monitoring. POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert 
and oriented and breathing comfortably.  The patient was 
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic 
or vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the 
patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The 
patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further 
recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued 
without complication.  Free water was restricted for mild 
hyponatremia, which improved prior to discharge.  He had a brief 
episode of rapid Atrial Fibrillation, which converted to SR with 
IV lopressor and titration of Atenolol.

cardiomegaly is mildly decreased from previous examination with 
intact sternotomy wires and valvuloplasty ring noted. 
IMPRESSION: Decrease in size of small right and unchanged 
moderate left  
pleural effusion with accompanying bibasilar atelectasis. 

pCXR ___
Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison 
to ___.  Cardiomegaly is severe, unchanged.  Left 
retrocardiac consolidation and pleural effusion are unchanged.  
Lungs are essentially clear at the upper and mid portions.  No 
pneumothorax is demonstrated.

The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is 
markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left The left atrium 
is moderately dilated. The right atrium is markedly dilated. 
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal 
cavity size. There is moderate to severe global left ventricular 
hypokinesis (LVEF = 25 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the 
left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased 
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right 
ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild global free wall 
hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus 
level. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The 
aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet 
motion and transvalvular gradients. A mitral valve annuloplasty 
ring is present. The mitral annular ring appears well seated 
with normal gradient. An eccentric, jet of mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure is high normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal 
cavity size and global hypokinesis Normal functioning aortic 
valve bioprosthesis and mitral valve repair. Dilated aortic 
sinus.

 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ s/p recent surgical AVR, MV repair and asending aorta 
replacement discharged on high dose furosemide now admitted with 
hypovolemia, hypotension and afib with RVR not responsive to 
metoprolol, but rate controlled with atenolol and sotalol.

# Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular 
response: 
High dose Metoprolol 100 mg po TID was ineffective at rate 
control. So was started on atenolol 50 mg po BID and sotalol. 
His QTc stayed 440-470 on sotalol. He had brief episodes of HR 
dropping to the ___ due to concealed PACs. Atenolol was 
decreased to 25 mg po BID.

Patient started on warfarin this admission, received nutrition 
education for warfarin. INR will be followed by Dr. ___.

# Arrythmia: concealed PACs which blocked at AV node and sinus 
giving bradycardia. Dose of atenolol decreased. Pt also had 2.2 
sec run of WCT (6 beats, CL 400ms). No Sx. Will follow with Dr. 
___.

# Hyponatremia: Most likely from daily furosemide use vs 
hypovolemic hyponatremia as improved with IVF and improvement of 
hypotension, but then downtrended slightly with increased dose 
of furosemide.

# Leukocytosis: Noted to have WBC 17K at rehabilitation, which 
continued to downtrend until normal this admission without 
antibiotics. Urine cultures and chest xray as well as blood 
cultures were unrevealing. No diarrhea noted to suggest c. diff. 
Surgical incision without signs of infection.  

# CHF: He was not volume overloaded at admission. In fact, he 
was dehydrated due to increase in dose of diuretics at rehab in 
the week prior to admission. CHF and decline in LV systolic

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a ___ y/o F with a PMHx significant for Hep C c/b 
hepatocellular carcinoma (Childs A), hyperthyroidism who was 
recently admitted here for what is thought to be infectious 
colitis now presenting with ___.  

ACTIVE ISSUES
==============
# ___
Patient was recently admitted with infectious colitis and had 
normal renal function at that time.  She returned with ___ (Cr 
3.5) which was ultimately thought to be pre-renal in nature 
given her history of vomiting/poor PO intake and downtrending Cr 
with IVF.  On the day of discharge, her cr had downtrended to 
1.5.  Given that she has a history of hepatitic C, cryoglobulins 
were checked and were pending at the time of discharge, and 
subsequently returned negative. RF, checked as a marker for 
cryoglobulinemia, was WNL. Given significant improvement of Cr 
with hydration as well as resolution of nausea, vomiting, and 
diarrhea, pt was discharged with plans for Cr recheck within 5 
days of discharge. Hospital course and transitional issues 
including Cr f/u were discussed directly with covering PCP by 
telephone on the day of discharge.

# Nausea
Patient was admitted with complaint of two days of nausea with 
one episode of non-blood emesis.  Patient was given IV zofran 
and nausea/vomiting resolved over the course of her stay.  Given 
patient's report of leg weakness, her acute episode of 
hypertension, her past history of seizures and hyponatremia, as 
well as her intermittent nausea/vomiting/abdominal pain, if 
patient experiences another acute episode, testing for acute 
intermittent porphyria could be considered in outpatient 
setting.

# Black stools
Patient reported having ""black stools"" over the 24-hours prior 
to admission.  Hct upon admission was stable and HR was not 
elevated to suggest acute blood loss. She denied taking any iron 
or supplements which would turn her stool black. On discharge, 
patient reported that her stools were more formed compared to 
prior to admission, and were of normal brown color.  

# Elevated blood pressures
During prior admission, patient had elevated BPs to the 
systolics of 170s, she was asymptomatic at the time.  She was 
started on amlodipine 5mg PO daily but this was discontinued at 
her PCP appointment two days prior to admission given 
normotensive readings.  Upon admission patient's blood pressure 
was elevated to SBP 185 and she was reinitiated on amlodipine.  
On the day of discharge, patient was once again normotensive and 
amlodipine was discontinued. Markedly elevated BPs were likely 
associated with ___. She will followup with her PCP as an 
outpatient for further blood pressure monitoring.

CHRONIC ISSUES
================
#  Hyperthyroidism: Continued home dose propylthiouracil 
#  Hepatitis C c/b hepatocellular carcinoma: Thrombocytopenia 
and transaminitis at baseline.

showed heterogeneous liver mass at hilum w invasion vs 
thrombosis
into portal vein. MRI then obtained, showed heterogeneously
enhancing mass predominantly intravascular in location within 
the
main portal vein w portions of relative hypo-enhancement, which
may represent bland thrombus adjacent to enhancing components
that likely represent tumor thrombus or an intravascular
malignancy such as leiomyosarcoma or angiosarcoma, potentially

BRIEF HOSPITAL SUMMARY
=====================
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with history of HCV s/p Harvoni c/b 
Childs A cirrhosis, history of prior hepatic lesion that 
spontaneously regressed on serial imaging, hyperthyroidism, and 
osteopenia who was transferred from ___ for continuity of care 
and biopsy. She initially presented to ___ with abdominal 
pain, nausea, and vomiting, where imaging showed a ~5cm liver 
lesion. She was then transferred to ___ where she had 
unsuccessful biopsy attempt, and therefore transferred to ___ for 
further workup and to see her regular providers. On arrival her 
symptoms had resolved. Radiology reread her images and 
recommended EUS-guided biopsy, lymphoma protocol (results 
pending). She had persistent hypertension after the biopsy that 
improved with medications. She also had tachycardia with 
exertion that improved with bolus of IVF. She was discharged 
with close follow up. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=================
[ ] We recommend the PCP follow up on the biopsy results. The 
oncology team here will also call the patient to schedule follow 
up when the biopsy results. 
[ ] Follow up on plasma metanephrine level and consider 24-hour 
urine metanephrine for further workup of possible 
pheochromocytoma if her symptoms persists
[ ] Will need EGD as follow up for cirrhosis management of 
variceal monitoring
[ ] If ___ has persistently poor appetite, consider starting 
mirtazapine QHS for appetite stimulation
[ ] Please titrate blood pressure medications as needed. 

# CONTACT: ___, Daughter, ___

MEDICATION CHANGES
==================
Increased lisinopril from 5mg daily to 20mg daily 
Started amlodipine 7.5mg daily for hypertension
Started marinol 2.5mg BID for appetite stimulation
Prescribing Zofran ODT for PRN use 

ACUTE ISSUES
===========
# Liver lesion with extension into portal vein 
At ___, CT torso showed heterogenous liver mass with invasion 
into the portal vein. An MRI showed a heterogenously enhancing 
mass predominantly intravascular in the main portal vein. ___ was 
unable to do the biopsy due to the location. GI was unable to 
collect tissue via EUS. Their plan was to consult surgical 
oncology for biopsy but after discussion with Dr. ___ was 
transferred to ___ for continuity of care. On arrival she 
reported her pain, nausea, and vomiting had resolved. CDs were 
obtained from ___ and ___ radiologists reread the films and 
recommended EUS. The ERCP fellow did a biopsy (results pending). 
___ had nausea and vomiting after the procedure that resolved 
with Zofran. 

# Hypertension
Well controlled on presentation. She reports she was recently 
diagnosed with hypertension but upon review of her atria's 
records it appears that she has been hypertensive in the clinic 
for several years and has declined antihypertensive medications. 
SBP 200s after procedure likely secondary to nausea, vomiting, 
and pain. However, hypertension persisted despite uptitration of 
medications. Workup for pheochromocytoma was initiated with 
plasma metanephrines because patient reported recent episodes of 
sweating. She was discharged on higher dose of lisinopril and 
amlodipine. 

# Tachycardia
#Orthostasis
Intermittent tachycardia after the biopsy worse with activity, 
not sustaining. Likely volume depleted in the setting of poor PO 
intake. We bolused her with fluids which improved her 
orthostasis.

# Nausea/Vomiting
Nausea and vomiting after biopsy likely secondary to MAC during 
the procedure. Resolved with zofran. 

# Anorexia
Patient reported poor appetite for several weeks, perhaps 
secondary to malignancy. We started marinol and nutrition was 
consulted who felt she met criteria for severe malnutrition. 

CHRONIC ISSUES

IMAGING
=========

RUQUS ___
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. Large, soft tissue lesion centered around the porta hepatis, 
with extension 
into the main portal vein, which does not demonstrate definite 
flow.  This is 
better assessed on the prior CT. 
2. Enlarged node adjacent to the pancreatic head, as seen on 
prior CT, 
measuring up to 3.5 cm. 
3. Moderate sludge within the gallbladder, without evidence of 
stones. 

MRCP ___
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. Redemonstration of a large mass centered with the porta 
hepatis which 
infiltrates and expands the main portal vein and the 
intrahepatic portal 
veins, not significantly changed compared with CT ___, 
but enlarged 
since  ___. 
2. No significant change in degree of mild to moderate 
intrahepatic biliary 
duct dilatation due to mass effect at the porta hepatis. 
3. Intrahepatic peribiliary enhancement, compatible with 
cholangitis.  No 
abscess. 
4. No evidence of cholecystitis. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with carcinoma of unknown 
primary, hepatobiliary in origin, HCV s/p Harvoni c/b Childs A 
cirrhosis, hyperthyroidism who presented with fever and RUQ pain 
c/f ascending cholangitis vs cholecystitis.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[] Patient on 7 day course of cefpedox/flagyl. Last day ___.
[] Discharge Hgb 9.9 on the day of discharge. Will follow-up on 
___ will cbc re-check.

ACUTE ISSUES
============
# Fever
# Leukocytosis
# Suspected cholangitis vs cholecystitis
She presented with fever, fatigue and abdominal pain. This was 
concerning for an infectious etiology, possibly cholangitis 
given her hx of ?hepatic carcinoma or cholecystitis. Fever could 
also be seen with cancer-associated thrombosis though there were 
no clear localizing signs to suggest this diagnosis. She had a 
leukocytosis to 12 which normalized by the time of discharge. 
She had a rising total bilirubin, which was thought to be iso 
intrahepatic biliary obstruction causing a possible infection. 
She was started on empiric ceftriaxone/flagyl. A RUQ US (___) 
showed a large soft-tissue ___ hepatis lesion extending 
into portal vein consistent with known malignancy. There were no 
signs of infection. An MRCP was then performed on ___ and showed 
intrahepatic peribiliary enhancement which was ""compatible with 
cholangitis"". By HD3 she was feeling better with no abdominal 
pain and she remained afebrile. She was transitioned to PO 
cefpedoxime/flagyl and discharged to finish a ___arcinoma of unknown primary
She had previously received FOLFOX C4D15 on ___. Due to 
persistent cytopenias and disease progression, the plan was to 
switch to new treatment at some point, possible lenvatinib. MRCP 
on ___ showed unchanged hepatic lesion with infiltration into 
the portal vein from prior CT on ___. She will have 
follow-up on ___ in ___ clinic. She was going to see 
Radiation Oncology on ___ but was unable to attend that 
appointment as she was hospitalized. She was seen by RadOnc 
during this hospitalization and will see them as an outpatient 
after discharge.

# Anemia
Pt was noted to have a down-trending hemoglobin to 9.9 (down 
from ___ on admission). Potentially there is an element of 
hemodilution however we have instructed the patient to have her 
labs checked on ___. Iron and B12 studies pending at the time of 
discharge. 

# Pain
She continued on her home oxycodone 5mg q4h PRN. Her abdominal 
pain improved during this admission.

# HTN
Her SBP was in the high 180s-190s upon admission in the setting 
of not being on her home anti-hypertensive and she remained 
asymptomatic. This was presumably in the setting of infection 
and pain. She continued on her lisinopril and amlodipine and her 
SBPs improved to 140s upon discharge.

# Osteoporosis
She continued on her weekly alendronate.

# Code status: Full presumed
# HCP: ___ (daughter) / p ___

This patient was prescribed, or continued on, an opioid pain 
medication at the time of discharge (please see the attached 
medication list for details). As part of our safe opioid 
prescribing process, all patients are provided with an opioid 
risks and treatment resource education sheet and encouraged to 
discuss this therapy with their outpatient providers to 
determine if opioid pain medication is still indicated.

monitoring study because of (1) occasional-frequent 
bifrontally-predominant sharp waves with a triphasic morphology, 
more prominent during arousals when they can occur in brief runs 
at up to 1 Hz, without evolution. This is consistent with 
generalized cortical Irritability that may be toxic-metabolic in 
etiology. (2) Mild generalized background slowing c/w a mild 
encephalopathy which is nonspecific in etiology and for which 
the most common causes are medication effect, toxic-metabolic 
Disturbance or infection. Note is made of an irregular 
tachycardia throughout much of the study. No pushbutton events 
or electrographic seizures are captured. Compared to the prior 
day's recording, there are no significant changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o woman with baseline dementia, DM2, and recent seizure 
activity (in context of hypoglycemia) transferred from 
___ with urosepsis and altered mental status. The 
patient was intubated in setting of altered mental status and 
failed extubation due to airway edema. Her hospital course was 
complicated by septic shock and respiratory failure now s/p 
trach/PEG, and new atrial fibrillation.

==================
ACTIVE ISSUES
==================

# Septic shock: On admission, the patient was found to be in 
septic shock, likely secondary to urinary source, with urine 
culture positive for E. coli from outside hospital. She was 
initially on ceftriaxone but was broadened to vancomycin/zosyn 
at OSH. Given that E. coli was sensitive was ceftriaxone, she 
was narrowed to this. However, she began to have persistent 
fevers so was broadened to vancomycin/cefepime. Given her 
altered mental status, cefepime was changed to ceftazidime due 
to concern for cefepime neurotoxicity. She completed a course of 
antibiotics for her urinary tract infection, but again became 
febrile on ___ and was started on vanc/zosyn given unclear 
etiology of fevers. Suspicion was for tracheitis in the setting 
of intubation. Her planned course of vanc/zosyn is 5 days (Last 
day: ___. At time of discharge, patient was afebrile with 
resolving leukocytosis (WBC 9.2) and minimal nonpurulent 
secretions. 

# Altered Mental Status: Patient with dementia at baseline. She 
had seizure-like events ___ years prior to admission. The patient 
had a seizure at the outside hospital while getting a CT scan. 
EEG done during admission showed mild-moderate diffuse 
encephalopathy, which implies widespread cerebral dysfunction 
but is nonspecific as to etiology. The patient had multiple 
repeat EEGs (___) that had 
similar findings. The patient was discharged on Keppra 500 mg 
BID and she should follow up with neurology.

# Respiratory failure: Patient with seizure at OSH while getting 
CT and was intubated for airway protection. She required 
intubation from ___ - ___. She then failed extuation due to 
airway edema on ___ and was reintubated. Patient had a trach 
placed on ___.

# Atrial fibrillation: New onset likely in the setting of septic 
shock. During this admission, patient has had heart rates 
ranging from 100 - 180. During this admission, she was trialed 
on various regimens with metoprolol, amiodarone, diltiazem, and 
digoxin. At time of discharge, patient was stable on metoprolol 
50 mg Q6H and digoxin 125mcg. Amiodarone was discontinued 
because it had little effect on her heart rates, and diltiazem 
was discontinued due to low blood pressures. She was started on 
anticoagulation with heparin gtt with bridge to warfarin, goal 
INR ___.

# Non-occlusive venous thrombosis (RUE): Patient was found to 
have a right upper extremity non-occlusive thrombus in setting 
of PICC line in place for IV antibiotics, last day ___. PICC 
should be discontinued as soon as possible. Patient on 
anticoagulation as above.

# PEG tube: Given altered mental status, a PEG tube was placed 
at the time of tracheostomy. The patient was initiated on tube 
feeds and was tolerating them well at time of discharge.

# DMII: Patient initially with uncontrolled glucose >400. 
Negative ketones on ___ was consulted and recommend 
adjustments to her insulin regimen. The patient was started on 
tube feeds as above. Patient was discharged on Lantus 40 units 
QAM and 12 unit regular insulin Q6H.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. ___,

You were admitted for your infection that lowered your blood 
pressure. You also needed a breathing tube and machine to help 
with your breathing, however, because your airway swelled you 
had to be transitioned to a tracheotomy, a surgical procedure 
that involved making an incision in your neck and connecting a 
tube to allow you to breathe. You also were given a feeding 
tube. You were started on medicines to control your heart rate, 
antibiotics to control your infection, and insulin for your 
diabetes.

Please continue the medications at rehabilitation and follow-up 
with your cardiologist and neurologist. 

We wish you the best of health.

Sincerely,
Your ___ Team

IMAGING
=======

+ CXR (___)
Left IJ approach central venous catheter tip projects over the 
mid SVC.  There
is no pneumothorax.  The lungs are clear.  There is no 
consolidation or
effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. 
 Dense
atherosclerotic calcifications noted in the thoracic aorta.  
Rounded opacity
projecting over left upper quadrant may represent a PEG tube.  
Surgical clips
in the right upper quadrant.

+ PELVIS AP (___)
No acute fracture.

+ RENAL US (___)
Normal renal ultrasound.  No evidence of hydronephrosis.

+ ECHO (___)
CONCLUSIONS
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure 
is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size 
are normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic 
(EF>75%). There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract 
obstruction (22 mmHg at HR 96). Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. There is abnormal septal 
motion/position. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened 
(?#). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets 
are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. 
There is severe mitral annular calcification. The study is 
inadequate to exclude significant mitral valve stenosis though 
demonstrates flow acceleration across the mitral valve 
consistent with at least mild functional stenosis. Trivial 
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the 
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly 
UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial 
effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, 
and hyperdynamic regional/global systolic function. Mild left 
ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Aortic regurgitation and 
mitral stenosis likely present (not well quantified on current 
study). Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
there is now a mild left ventricular outflow tract gradient 
during systole. 

+ CXR (___)
Compared to chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
Lung volumes are substantially lower.  New peribronchial 
opacification in the
left lower lobe is more likely atelectasis than pneumonia.  The 
upper lungs
are clear.  No pleural abnormality.  Heart size normal.  Left 
jugular line
ends in the mid SVC, as before.

+ G-TUBE CHECK (___)
A percutaneous gastrostomy tube is present and is adequately 
positioned with
no evidence of extravasated contrast material.

+ EEG (___)
This is an abnormal continuous EEG monitoring study because of
(1) posterior quadrant discharges (L>R), indicative of focal 
areas of cortical
irritability with increased propensity to develop electrographic 
seizures. (2)
Diffuse background slowing with periods of generalized 
suppressions are
consistent with a moderate to severe encephalopathy. This is a 
nonspecific
finding in regards to etiology but can be seen in the setting of
toxic/metabolic derangements, infection or medications. There 
are no
electrographic seizures. Compared to the previous day's 
recording, there is a
significant improvement in the background with much less 
frequent epileptiform
discharges/triphasic appearing waveforms.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF SUMMARY STATEMENT:
=============================
___ w/ Afib, seizure disorder, systolic CHF, and dementia, who 
presented with altered mental status, had a cardiac arrest in 
the ED, and was admitted to the ICU for post-arrest management. 
Course was complicated by UTI and acute renal failure, and she 
improved with fluids and antibiotics. Code status changed to 
DNR/DNI. 

ACTIVE ISSUES:
=============================
# CARDIAC ARREST: Patient had transient episode of asystole in 
the ED after getting calcium gluconate/insulin/dextrose for 
hyperkalemia. ROSC achieved after brief (around 10 seconds) of 
chest compressions. Unclear precipitant but concerning 
elevations in aVR and depressions in lateral leads on EKG. 
Cardiac enzymes reassuringly negative. Long pause vs asystole 
potentially from calcium gluconate infusion in the setting of 
elevated dig level. Patient w/ known CAD and documented stents 
in RCA territory. EKG changes potentially demand in the setting 
of being hyperdynamic due to hypovolemia and infected. She was 
closely monitored on telemetry, and remained hemodynamically 
stable throughout rest of hospitalization. 

# URINARY TRACT INFECTION: Patient presented w/o documented 
fevers but with leukocytosis w/ neutrophilic predominance and UA 
suggestive of infection. CXR w/o acute process. LFTs wnl. No 
imaging evidence of pyelonephritis. Chronic ulcers to coccyx and 
___ as potential sources of infection.  New G-tube oozing at 
site, cultured- growing ___ albicans. IP adjusted 
bumper. Afebrile. She was thought to have a UTI, and was started 
initially on Vanc/Zosyn, and Vanc was stopped on ___. 
Vancomycin should continue for 7day course, to end on ___. 

# ___: Patient presented w/ Cr elevated to 4.3 and BUN 123 w/ 
anion gap metabolic acidosis and several electrolyte 
abnormalities including K of 7.3 prior to treatment. Initially 
oliguric.  UA c/w UTI and reportedly from daughter has been 
hospitalized from sepsis w/ urinary origin in the recent past 
resulting in some degree of chronic kidney damage. Electrolytes 
and kidney function improved with fluid resuscitation and 
pressors. Renal US without evidence of obstruction. K now 
normalized. At discharge, Cr was 0.9.
 
CHRONIC ISSUES: 
=============================
# HISTORY OF SEIZURES: Patient w/ baseline dementia but 
reportedly able to participate in conversations w/ family. About 
___ hours of noted increasing lethargy at her facility. NCHCT 
reassuringly w/o acute intracranial abnormality and non-focal 
neuro exam. She has multiple sources of potential toxic 
metabolic encephalopathy due to her presumed infection and acute 
renal failure. EEG with significant posterior predominant 
epileptiform discharges and triphasics. Improved with addition 
of phenytoin, which was discontinued prior to discharge. At 
discharge, she was stable on Keppra 1000mg POBID.

# Atrial fibrillation: Initially required levophed and was 
tachycardic to 110s on this. Rates have been in ___ off 
Levophed. Her digoxin was initially held in setting of ___, and 
was stopped. Her Metoprolol was also stopped due to soft blood 
pressures 
 
# Goals of care: Per patients daughter/HCP, patient has had 
repeated hospitalizations over the past year with more time 
spent in the hospital than outside of it. Code status changed to 
DNR/DNI on ___. Palliative care was consulted. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
=============================
[ ] Complete 7-day course of Zosyn, to end on ___
[ ] Consider restarting metoprolol if HR persistently >120
[ ] platelets were ___ at discharge. 
[ ] Code status: changed to DNR/DNI

Brief Hospital Course:
1. LEGAL & SAFETY:  
On admission, the patient signed a conditional voluntary 
agreement (Section 10 & 11) and remained on that level 
throughout her admission. She was also placed on 15 minute 
checks, our lowest checks status, and remained on that level of 
observation throughout her stay, while being unit-restricted.  

2. PSYCHIATRIC:
#) Major depressive disorder: 
On arrival to the unit, patient was tearful and endorsed 
""depressed"" mood with labile affect. She did state that she was 
having suicidal thoughts about the ""world being better off 
without me"" before getting into the ___ water, and that then 
the tide swept her away. Stated that she was very happy to have 
survived, but that she was struggling with guilt surrounding 
hurting her husband and child. Also expressed remorse 
surrounding the idea of losing custody of her child. She was 
accepting of care, and able to contract for safety while on the 
unit. Denied any acute suicidal ideation, intent, or plan. 
Stated that in the past the medication that had worked the best 
for her was Prozac. She was maintained on trazodone 50mg PO QHS 
for sleep.
During her stay, her home Paxil was downtitrated and Prozac was 
started and uptitrated. She was increased to Prozac 20mg PO QD. 
Additionally, she was started on Depakote for possible 
hypomania. She was increased to Depakote 500 mg QHS. She 
reported improvement in mood, as well as increased ability to 
cope with her circumstances. Patient and her family were very 
pleased and relieved to have a diagnosis of bipolar II disorder 
as they strongly believe her past problematic behavior is 
accurately explained by this condition. At the time of 
discharge, ___ was attending groups, was interactive in 
the milieu, and was able to participate in individual therapy. 

On discharge, patient reports ""better"" mood, has euthymic 
affect, and denies any suicidal thought, intent, or plan. She is 
future-oriented, with plan to attend intensive outpatient 
program and live at her parents' house before trying to go back 
to work. She will be discharged to home on Prozac 20 mg PO QD, 
trazodone 50mg PO QHs and Depakote 500 mg QHS.

3. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS:
#)Alcohol use disorder: 
Patient arrived to the ED with BAL 285, reported that she drank 
a pint of vodka prior to going into the ___. She was kept on a 
CIWA scale for withdrawal while on the inpatient unit, though 
she did not score. She reports a history of binge drinking, and 
states that she attended AA meetings a few times in the past, 
though not recently. She did attend AA and Smart Recovery while 
here on the unit. Was referred to both outpatient, and states 
that she plans to attend.

4. MEDICAL
#) Anion gap acidosis: Patient arrived to the ___ with an 
anion gap acidosis on serum testing, likely in setting of recent 
alcohol use. This resolved with conservative management in the 
ED. 

#) Hypothyroidism: Patient with TSH of 6.1 on admission to the 
inpatient unit. Her home Synthroid was increased to 50mcg PO QD. 
It is possible that hypothyroidism could have contributed in 
part to her mood episode.

5. PSYCHOSOCIAL
#) GROUPS/MILIEU:  
The patient was encouraged to participate in the various groups 
and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit.  The 
patients primary team met with her daily and various 
psychotherapeutic modalities were utilized during those times. 
She was increasingly able to engage in groups and therapy during 
her stay, as her mood and emotional lability improved. 

#) COLLATERAL CONTACTS & FAMILY INVOLVEMENT
A family meeting was held with the patient's mother, ___ 
___. The patient reported not wanting to be a part of 
this meeting, as she felt that it would agitate her further. 

#) INTERVENTIONS
- Medications: Prozac
- Psychotherapeutic Interventions: Individual, group, and milieu 
therapy.
- Coordination of aftercare: Intensive outpatient program

INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, 
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of 
starting this medication, and risks and benefits of possible 
alternatives, including not taking the medication, with this 
patient.   We discussed the patient's right to decide whether to 
take this medication as well as the importance of the patient's 
actively participating in the treatment and discussing any  
questions about medications with the treatment team, and I  
answered the patient's questions.  The patient appeared able to 
understand and consented to begin the medication.

RISK ASSESSMENT
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to herself and/or others based upon 
attempted suicide attempt by drowning in the ___. 
Their static factors noted at that time include history of 
suicide attempts, chronic mental illness, history of substance 
abuse, Caucasian race, age, marital status.  She also had 
several modifiable risk factors addressed at that time, 
including disorganized and unpredictable behavior, hopelessness, 
agitation, recklessness, social withdrawal, limited coping 
skills, no established outpatient treatment, and active 
substance abuse. We addressed these risk factors by restarting 
her on Prozac, holding a family meeting, and connecting her with 
outpatient treaters and an intensive outpatient program. 
Finally, the patient is being discharged with many protective 
risk factors, including help-seeking nature, future-oriented 
viewpoint, sense of responsibility to family, lack of suicidal 
ideation, and family support. Overall, based on the totality of 
our assessment at this time, the patient is not at an acutely 
elevated risk of self-harm nor danger to others. Our prognosis 
of this patient is fair, given the above.

Pertinent Results:
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  ___ 9:06 AM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: Assess size of ventricles 

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
___ year old woman with ___ evd clamped 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Assess size of ventricles 
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HEAD CT

HISTORY: ___ woman with subarachnoid hemorrhage with 
ventricular drain clamped, assess for change in size of 
ventricles.

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images of the head were obtained 
from the skull base to the vertex.

FINDINGS: Comparison is made to ___.

Again seen is a ventricular shunt via left frontal approach with 
tip of the catheter within the region of the right foramen of 
___. The ventricles are re-expanded bilaterally, and there has 
also been decrease in size of the right extra-axial fluid 
collection as well as improved edema of the right frontal and 
basal ganglial infarcts. Therefore, the increase in size of the 
ventricles likely is due to decreased mass effect with 
improvement in the subfalcine herniation as opposed to clamping 
of the ventricular shunt.

Again seen is a small hypodensity along the ventricular shunt 
tract involving the left frontal lobe as before.

The basal cisterns, especially the quadrigeminal plate and 
ambient cisterns are better visualized suggestive of improved 
edema.

Tiny amounts of pneumocephalus are again seen.

Coil pack is again seen within the anterior communicating artery 
aneurysm.

Post-surgical changes of the right scalp are again noted.

IMPRESSION: Since ___, decrease in size of right extra-axial 
collection and decreased edema of the right basal 
ganglia/frontal lobe infarct, with improvement in the subfalcine 
herniation and improvement in mass effect of the lateral 
ventricles.

The basal cisterns are better visualized suggestive of improved 
cerebral edema.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  ___ 8:48 AM

INDICATION: ___ female with possible inadvertent 
withdrawal of central venous line.

COMPARISON: ___.

SINGLE PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The right subclavian 
catheter has been pulled back and now resides projecting over 
the right subclavian vein. There is no pneumothorax. The 
cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable and unremarkable and the 
lungs are clear.

CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS  ___ 9:45 AM

CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS; CT BRAIN PERFUSION

Reason: ** CTA/CTP** as per Dr. ___ 
Contrast: OPTIRAY

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
___ year old woman with acom SAH, s/p clipping 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
** CTA/CTP** as per Dr. ___ 
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: ___ status post ACom clipping.

COMPARISON: CT perfusion ___.

TECHNIQUE: Continuous axial images of the brain were obtained 
before and following administration of 100 cc IV Optiray 
contrast. Multiplanar MIP and volume-rendered CTA reformats were 
displayed. Mean transit time blood flow and blood volume were 
assessed by dynamic imaging.

FINDINGS:

NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: ACom aneurysm clip with associated 
metallic artifact is noted. Again seen is a hypoattenuating area 
within the right temporal and inferior frontal lobe consistent 
with evolving infarct. There is also expanding and increasingly 
conspicuous hypoattenuation within the right basal caudate, 
putamen, and internal capsule consistent with new/progressive 
infarction of this region. High-density right extra-axial fluid 
collection with small locules of air is unchanged measuring 13 
mm in greatest diameter. There is slightly increased mass effect 
on the subjacent sulci and increasing transtentorial and 
subfalcine herniation with leftward midline shift of 8 mm, 
previously 7 mm. Left ventriculostomy catheter terminates within 
the left lateral ventricle at the midline and the ventricles are 
stable in size. There is worsening effacement of the suprasellar 
and ambient cisterns consistent with increasing mass effect. The 
13-mm subgaleal fluid collection overlying the right frontal 
craniotomy is stable.

CTA OF THE HEAD: The cervical portions of the carotid arteries, 
vertebral arteries, and basilar artery are patent. There is 
improved opacification in the circle of ___ and its major 
branches. Specifically, there is marked improvement of vasospasm 
involving the distal right M1 and right M2 segments of the MCA. 
There is improvement in vasospasm of the A1 segments bilaterally 
(right greater than left) though the right A1 segment still 
shows moderate vasospasm. The A2 segments bilaterally also 
demonstrate markedly improved caliber. The left MCA and its 
branches are unremarkable. The bilateral PCA arteries are also 
unremarkable.

CT PERFUSION: There is patchy perfusion abnormality with 
decreased blood volume in the bilateral temporal lobes and also 
right frontal lobe, which likely relate to vasospasm.

IMPRESSION:

1. New/progressive infarction within the right basal ganglia.

2. Increasing mass effect and transtentorial herniation with 
worsening effacement of the suprasellar and ambient cisterns.

3. Improving vasospasm within the right MCA, and bilateral A1 
and A2 segments of the ACA. There is, however, persistent 
moderate vasospasm within the A1 segments, in close proximty to 
the ACOM aneurysm clip.

Findings were discussed with the neurosurgical team at 5:00 p.m.

carotid arteriogram, and right internal carotid arteriogram.

STAFF: Dr. ___.

FELLOW: Dr. ___.

Dr. ___ attending interventional neuroradiologist, was 
present and supervised throughout the procedure.

INDICATION: ___ female status post surgical clipping of 
an anterior communicating artery aneurysm, now post-operative 
day number seven. Rule out vasospasm.

COMPARISON: ___.

TECHNIQUE: Written informed consent was obtained from the 
patient's daughter after discussing the indications for the 
procedure, the risks of the procedure, and the alternative 
management. The discussed risks include stroke, loss of vision 
and/or speech which may be temporary or permanent, with possible 
treatment with stents and/or coils if needed. Additionally the 
indications, risks, and alternative management for possible 
intervention was explained.

The patient was brought to the interventional neuroradiology 
suite and placed on the biplane table in the supine position. 
Both groins were prepped and draped in the usual sterile 
fashion. A pre-procedure timeout was performed using two patient 
identifiers and verifying the procedure to be performed.

Access to the right common femoral artery was obtained using a 
19-gauge single-wall needle with 1% lidocaine mixed with sodium 
bicarbonate for local anesthetic. A 0.35 ___ wire was 
introduced through the needle, and the needle was removed. A 5 
___ vascular sheath was placed over the wire and connected to 
a saline infusion (mixed with heparin 500 units in 500 cc of 
saline) with a continuous drip. Through the sheath, a 4 ___ 
___ catheter was introduced and connected to a continuous 
saline infusion (mixed with heparin 1000 units in 1000 cc of 
saline). The following vessels were selectively catheterized, 
and arteriograms were performed from the following locations: 
Right common carotid artery, right internal carotid artery, left 
vertebral artery, left common carotid artery, and left internal 
carotid artery. After review of the study, the catheter and the 
sheath were withdrawn. Hemostasis was achieved using manual 
compression. The patient tolerated the procedure well without 
any immediate post-procedure complications.

FINDINGS:

RIGHT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY: The bifurcation is normal. There is 
no evidence of a vascular malformation.

RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: The cervical, petrous, cavernous, 
and supraclinoid segments of the internal carotid artery are 
normal. There is a surgical clip identified in the region of the 
anterior communicating artery with no residual aneurysm 
identified. There is mild stenosis of the M1 segment of the 
middle cerebral artery and moderate stenosis of the M2 middle 
cerebral artery branches. Additionally there is moderate 
stenosis of the A1 segment of the anterior cerebral artery with 
a focus of luminal irregularity in its proximal portion. There 
is decreased parenchymal phase blood flow identified within the 
right anterior watershed vascular distribution.

At this point, the decision was made for an intervention. 5 mg 
of verapamil was gently infused selectively into the right 
internal carotid artery over 1 minute. A right internal carotid 
artery angiogram was then repeated at approximately 10 minutes 
after the infusion of verapamil which demonstrated residual 
mild-to-moderate narrowing of the right A1 segment of the 
anterior cerebral artery, and right M1 and M2 segments of the 
middle cerebral artery.

LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY: The left vertebral artery and the left 
posterior inferior cerebellar artery appear unremarkable. There 
is no reflux identified into the right vertebral artery. The 
basilar artery appears unremarkable.

5 mg of verapamil was gently infused selectively into the left 
vertebral artery over ___AROTID ARTERY: The bifurcation is normal. There is 
no vascular malformation.

LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: The cervical, petrous, cavernous, 
and supraclinoid segments of the left internal carotid artery 
are normal. There is mild narrowing of the A1 segment of the 
left anterior cerebral artery. The left middle cerebral artery 
as well as its major branches appear unremarkable. A surgical 
clip is identified in the region of the anterior communicating 
artery with no residual aneurysm seen.

5 mg of verapamil was gently infused selectively into the left 
internal carotid artery over 1 minute. A post-infusion angiogram 
the left internal carotid artery demonstrates mild narrowing of 
the A1 segment of the anterior cerebral artery.

MODERATE SEDATION: 100 mcg of intravenous Fentanyl and 4 mg of 
intravenous Versed were administered in divided doses by a 
registered nurse, who was monitoring the patient throughout the 
2 hour and 15 minute intraservice time. Please refer to the 
nursing record for further detail.

IMPRESSION:
1. Status post surgical clipping of an anterior communicating 
aneurysm with no residual aneurysm identified.

2. Moderate narrowing of the right M1 and M2 segments of the 
middle cerebral artery and right A1 anterior cerebral artery, 
and mild narrowing of the left A1 segment of the anterior 
cerebral artery consistent with vasospasm. 5 mg of verapamil was 
selectively infused into the right internal carotid, left 
vertebral, and left internal carotid arteries for a total of 15 
mg of verapamil. Post- infusion angiogram demonstrated residual 
mild-to- moderate narrowing of the right M1 and M2 segments of 
the middle cerebral artery and right A1 segment of the anterior 
cerebral artery and residual mild narrowing of the A1 segment of 
the anterior cerebral artery.

CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HISTORY: ___ female with subarachnoid hemorrhage, ACOM 
aneurysm, with total vision loss on the right and blurriness on 
the left.

COMPARISON: CTA head of ___.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging sequences 
were obtained through the brain without administration of IV 
contrast. 3D time-of-flight MR arteriography was also performed.

MRI/MRA OF BRAIN: Again seen is subarachnoid hemorrhage along 
the right insular sulci, the basilar cisterns, and the 
suprasellar cistern. A cluster of punctate regions of increased 
FLAIR signal may represent extension of the subarachnoid 
hemorrhage into perivascular spaces. No other region of 
hemorrhage is noted. The size of the hemorrhage is unchanged 
from the CTA of one day prior. There is no region of infarction, 
no shift of midline structures, and no evidence of mass. Mild 
hydrocephalus remains.

Again seen is an aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery 
which measures up to 10 mm long with a region of increased 
signal within the aneurysm which may represent a thrombus. The 
aneurysm is superior to the optic chiasm and indents the 
anterior portion of the chiasm. The orbits and optic nerves 
otherwise appear normal. No other aneurysms are seen on the MRA. 
The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. No 
osseous or soft tissue abnormality is otherwise seen.

IMPRESSION:
1. Subarachnoid hemorrhage in the basal cisterns and the right 
sulci unchanged from CTA of one day prior.
2. ACOM aneurysm superior to chiasm extends inferiorly to indent

permanent, with possible treatment with stents and coils if 
needed. The patient was brought to the interventional 
neuroradiology suite and placed on the biplane table in supine 
position. Both groins were prepped and draped in the usual 
sterile fashion. A preprocedure timeout was performed using two 
patient identifiers. The patient had an indwelling sheath in the 
right common femoral artery from the pre-operative cerebral 
angiogram. Through the sheath, a 5 ___ ___ catheter 
was introduced and connected to a continuous saline infusion 
(mixed with heparin 1000 units in 1000 cc of saline.). The 
following vessels were selectively catheterized, and 
arteriograms were performed from the following locations: Right 
common carotid artery, left common carotid artery. After review 
of the films, the catheter and the sheath were withdrawn. 
Hemostasis was obtained with an Angio-Seal device. The patient 
tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.

FINDINGS:

RIGHT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY: The visualized external carotid 
arterial branches appear unremarkable.

RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: The cervical, petrous, cavernous 
and supraclinoid segments are normal. The right middle cerebral 
artery is normal. There is no residual filling of the previously 
noted aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery. There is no 
narrowing of the A1 segment of the right anterior cerebral 
artery. The remainder of the anterior cerebral artery appears 
normal.

LEFT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY: The visualized external carotid 
arterial branches appear unremarkable.

LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: The cervical, petrous, cavernous 
and supraclinoid segments are normal. The left middle cerebral 
artery is normal. There is no filling of the previously noted 
aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery. There is no 
narrowing of the A1 segment of the left anterior cerebral 
artery. The remainder of the anterior cerebral artery appears 
normal.

MEDICATIONS: The procedure was performed under general 
anesthesia.

IMPRESSION: No residual filling of the clipped aneurysm of the 
anterior communicating artery. No narrowing of the A1 segments 
of the right or left anterior cerebral arteries.

   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS  ___ 11:25 ___

CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS

Reason: SAH, MS CHANGES
Contrast: OPTIRAY

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
___ year old woman with osh with sah, headache for 10 days 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for sah 
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HISTORY: ___ female with headache for ten days and 
transferred from outside hospital with subarachnoid hemorrhage.

COMPARISON: No prior exam is available for comparison.

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the 
brain without contrast material. Subsequently, rapid axial 
imaging was performed through the brain during infusion of IV 
Optiray contrast material. Multiplanar maximum intensity 
projection images were then obtained. 3D volume-rendered images 
are pending.

CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Regions of high density along the 
right sulci, the basal cisterns, and the suprasellar cisterns 
are consistent with subarachnoid hemorrhage on the right. There 
is extension of this hyperdense material into the sella. There 
is mild hydrocephalus. Otherwise, there is no evidence of mass, 
edema, shift of normally midline structures, or large vascular 
territory infarction. No fractures are seen. The frontal sinuses 
are not pneumatized. Otherwise, the paranasal sinuses and the 
mastoid air cells are clear.

CTA HEAD: There is an 8 x 5 mm anterior communicating artery 
aneurysm which points inferoposteriorly in the suprasellar 
region and extends into the sella. Slight attenuation of the 
right more than left middle cerebral arteries may represent 
vasospasm. No other aneurysm is seen. The carotid and vertebral 
arteries and their major branches are otherwise patent, without 
evidence of focal stenosis or vascular abnormality.

IMPRESSION:
1. Subarachnoid hemorrhage along right insular sulci, basal 
cisterns, and suprasellar cistern.
2. 8 x 5-mm ACOM aneurysm extends inferoposteriorly into the 
sella. Slight attenuation of the MCAs may represent some amount 
of vasospasm.

with continued  headache and right eye blindness.  

Neuro: Exam followed q 1 hour during ICU stay.  ICP monitored 
via external ventricular drain system.  CSF diversion through 
EVD for hydrocephalus ___ IVH/SAH.  Ultimately pt tolerated 
having system removed on ___ without further hydrocephalus or 
elevated ICP's. Pt had CTA and cerebral angiogram on arrival.  
Endovascular coiling of A-COMM aneurysm was attempted and 
unsuccessful.  She was brought to the operating for a formal 
open craniotomy for aneurysm clipping on Hospital day #1.  
Subsequent CTA's/CTP's and cerebral angiograms were performed 
based on pt clinical exam and ICP's.  She was started on 
nimodipine on hospital day number one.  She is due to finish her 
21 day course on ___.  She was treated for intermittent bouts 
of vasopsasm with injection therapy during angiography as well 
as triple H therapy.  Some resultant cerebral infarcts were 
noted during imaging (see final diagnosis / discharge 
worksheet).
She was started on antiepileptics (dilantin) on her day of 
arrival and was switched to keppra as it was questioned that 
Dilatin may have been a fever source for her. 
Mannitol and solumedrol doses were tapered to off without 
episode.  

CV: no issues during this hospitalization.

RESP:Pt was intubated for the intial angiogram and subsequent 
surgery - she was extubated the following day and tolerated it 
well.

ID: The pt had fever during her stay.  Cultures were sent 
periodically according to temp's including CSF from the EVD 
system.  Medications were switched to rule out source of temp. 
Her cultures were negative including a MRSA and VRE screen.  She 
did have a UTI / E.coli noted on hosp day #1 and this was 
treated.  No additional fever source was identified.   

RENAL: No issues during this hospitalization.

ENDO:

# OSH ERCP (___): The major papilla was normal. The bile 
duct was deeply cannulated. Contrast was injected. I personally 
interpreted the bile duct images. Ductal flow of contrast was 
adequate. Imagequality was adequate. Contrast extended to the 
main bile duct. Contrast extended to the cystic duct. Contrast 
extended to  the hepatic ducts. A long cystic duct stump 
originated in the
lower third of the main bile duct. The lower third of the main 
bile duct contained one stone. The main bile duct was dilated. 
Biliary sphincterotomy was made with a traction (standard) 
sphincterotome using ___ electrocautery. There was no 
post-sphincterotomy bleeding. The biliary tree was swept with a 
11.5 mm balloon and basket starting at the bifurcation. Sludge 
was swept from the duct. A few stones were removed. Pus was 
coming out of the ampulla. One stone remained. The basket got 
stuck with the stone in the bile duct and the wire broke 
proximally instead of breaking around the stone. 
Post Procedure Diagnosis:
     - The major papilla appeared normal.
     - The patient has had a cholecystectomy.
     - The entire main bile duct was dilated.
     - Choledocholithiasis with a partial obstruction was found.
Partial removal was accomplished by biliary sphincterotomy; no 
stent was inserted. 
Complications: Unable to remove basket with one wire coming out 
of the mouth 
.
# OSH CT abd/pelvic (___): Mild diffuse thickening of the 
gastric  antrum, which can be seen in  the setting of gastritis. 
 2. Uterine fibroids. 

# ERCP (___): The scout film showed an impacted wire basket. The 
bile duct was deeply cannulated with the sphincterotome. 
Contrast was injected and there was brisk flow through the 
ducts. Contrast extended to the entire biliary tree. The wire 
basket was seen in the distal CBD. The left and right hepatic 
ducts and all intrahepatic branches were normal. To facilitate 
removal of the basket, a sphincteroplasty was made with a CRE 
balloon from 12 mm to 15 mm.  The biliary tree was then swept 
with a balloon above the impacted basket. The wire basket was 
removed from the patient. Stones were also extracted. A ___ x 5 
cm double pigtail stent was placed in the main duct. Excellent 
bile and contrast drainage was seen endoscopically and 
fluoroscopically

 
Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT & PLAN: ___ year old female with h/o DM, HTN, HLD, h/o 
gallstones s/p remote CCY in ___ who presents with 
n/v/abdominal pain/diarrhea/fevers found to have obstructive 
choledolithiasis and cholangitis s/p ERCP with removal of some 
stones but then the basket got stuck with the stone in the bile 
duct and the wire
broke proximally.
.
# OBSTRUCTIVE CHOLEDOLITHIASIS, CHOLANGITIS, RETAINED BASKET 
WIRE. Ms. ___ was admitted s/p ERCP (done at ___ 
Endoscopy) for cholangitis - however course was complicated by 
the retention of basket wire within the distal CBD.  She 
underwent ERCP here where sphincteroplasty was performed, basket 
wire was retrieved along with multiple CBD stones.  A CBD stent 
was placed to expedite clearance of any remaining stones/sludge. 

   She presented with leukocytosis, elevated LFTs, RUQ abd pain, 
pus from the CBD duct c/w cholangitis.  For this, she was 
treated with IV unasyn along with IV dilaudid and zofran PRN for 
pain/nausea control.  She did well after the ERCP procedure - 
and was able to tolerate a regular diet the same day.  She will 
need to complete 5 more day of ciprofloxacin and flagyl.  Due to 
loose stool and diarrhea (and recent iv antibiotics), the 
concern was for the possibility of C.diff.  Stool c.diff were 
sent - and extra doses of flagyl were prescribed in case the 
stool studies returned positive.  She should not take any 
aspirin, Plavix, NSAIDS, Coumadin for the following 5 days.  She 
will need a repeat ERCP 4 weeks for stent pull and 
re-evaluation. 

# GASTRITIS:  Ms. ___ had a positive H pylori test at OSH.  
Abd CT also revealed with diffuse thickening of the antrum 
consistent with gastritis.  A 14-day prescription of PPI, 
Clarithromycin and Amoxicilli was given for treatment of H. 
Pylori.  Since this is not urgent, she (through her daughter) 
understands that this need not be immediately treated and may be 
postponed until the cholangitis is fully treated (and prospect 
of C.diff is eliminated). 

# DIABETES MELLITUS - last Hgb A1C 6.5 not on medications at 
home.  She was placed on ISS here along with diabetic diet.

# HTN/HLD: HCTZ/toprol/lisinpril were continued.  Lipitor can be

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure looking after you, Ms. ___.  As you know, 
you underwent an ERCP here to retrieve the wire basket stuck in 
the common bile duct.  You tolerated the ERCP here well: the 
wire was removed along with the stones within the common bile 
duct.  A bile duct stent was also placed to ensure adequate 
passage of biliary stones.   
   Please complete 5 days of ciprofloxacin and flagyl 
(antibiotics) to treat the infection within the bile duct.  
Thereafter, you can start the other antibiotics (prilosec, 
amoxicillin, clarithromycin) to treat H.Pylori.  Since treatment 
of H.Pylori is not urgent, you may elect to delay the H.Pylori 
treatment until there is enough time to recover from the 
cholangitis and ensure that you are not infected with C.diff.  
We will contact you with the stool Cdiff results. 
   You will be contacted by our ERCP department to schedule a 
follow up ERCP to remove the stent.

IMAGING STUDIES
=================
The left atrial volume index is normal. No atrial septal defect 
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity 
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF 
>55%). Doppler parameters are most consistent with normal left 
ventricular diastolic function. There is no ventricular septal 
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are 
normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch 
levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears 
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is 
no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. 

 IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular chamber size and 
regional/global systolic function. No pathologic valvular flow.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
====================
[ ] Chest pain - unclear if of cardiac etiology or otherwise. If 
this is deemed to be of cardiac origin, initiation of a 
long-acting nitrate can be considered as blood pressures allow
[ ] Positive MIBI - patient should follow up with a cardiologist 
to decide whether elective cardiac catheterization is necessary 
following a recent MIBI with a small area of decreased perfusion 
that reversed with rest
[ ] Started on Aspirin - discussed w/ ___. Pt okay to be on 
ASA. Felt it has benefit for her primary prophylaxis in CAD. 

___ year old female with DMII, HTN, HLD, history of ICH w/ 
residual R-sided blindness and a recent stress MIBI suggestive 
of a small area of decrease perfusion that reversed with rest 
presented from her PCPs office with chest pain concerning for a 
coronary etiology.

ACTIVE PROBLEMS
================
# Chest Pain
The patient presented with chest pain that she described as 
""pressure"" in her neck. Given concern for coronary artery 
disease, troponins were checked (negative x3) and EKGs were 
obtained (no acute ischemic changes). A more robust history was 
elicited, which suggested that she feels this chest pain 
intermittently (no daily but several times per week) and has not 
noted any correlation with rest or exercise. She takes her 
sublingual nitroglycerin when she is feeling pain, which helps 
sometimes but not always. She also recalls some events that were 
relieved with rest and some that lasted for several hours. Based 
on this, it remains unclear if her chest pain is coronary in 
origin. She also had an echocardiogram that was unremarkable. 
Given the negative objective work up and the very questionable 
history of her chest pain, cardiac catheterization was deferred 
at this time. Her metoprolol succinate and lisinopril were 
continued, and she was started on 81mg aspirin daily (after 
consultation with neurosurgery). Consideration was made to 
initiate nitrate therapy, however he blood pressures remained 
too soft. This can be further considered in the outpatient 
setting.

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS
========================
# DMII - held metformin while inpatient and initiated Humalog 
sliding scale

# HTN - held HCTZ in favor of lisinopril and metoprolol

# HLD - continued atorvastatin

# Anxiety - continued Wellbutrin 100mg BID

patient's son, he had been sleeping more and talking and eating 
less. His gait and behavior had been altered such that if the 
patient's son asks him to walk forward he walks backward and if 
asked to lift his tongue upward he moves it downward. His mental 
status and cognition have also been somewhat depressed. He was 
prescribed Ambien approx three weeks prior to admission for 
insomnia, however that was promptly discontinued when fatigue 
persisted. No other new medication changes. Although chronic 
urinary urgency had previously prompted the patient to ask for 
help to the bathroom, he has not been asking for assistance as 
of late. He completed a 10-day course of levofloxacin for 
pneumonia approximately one month before his admission. No 
history of fever, chills, headache, cough, chest pain, shortness 
of breath, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria, rash, 
weakness, numbness, parasthesias, or falls. The patient was

There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is 
no pericardial effusion. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the previously mentioned inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis 
is not seen on the current report. The other findings are 
similar.  
.
Abdominal Ultrasound (___):
FINDINGS: There is no hydronephrosis identified in either 
kidney. The bladder is only partially distended. The solid mass 
is again seen within the lumen of the bladder measuring 2.4 x 
2.7 x 3.1 cm. This appears slightly larger than the ultrasound 
of ___ when this mass measured 2.2 x 1.9 x 1.9 cm. No 
additional masses identified within the region of the pelvis, 
however, ultrasound is limited in its ability to evaluate this 
area. 
IMPRESSION: 1) No hydronephrosis. 2) Solid bladder mass 
measuring 3.1 cm 
which is slightly larger than the prior ultrasound as described 
above. 3) No additional pelvic mass identified on limited 
imaging. 
.
Right ___ ultrasound (___):
COMPARISON: Right lower extremity ultrasound from ___. 
ULTRASOUND IMAGES OF THE RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY VEINS: The right 
common 
femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins demonstrate 
normal flow, 
compressibility and augmentation. The right peroneal veins are 
patent. The 
right posterior tibial veins are not definitively identified.
IMPRESSION: Limited study as the right posterior tibial veins 
were not 
definitively identified, otherwise no evidence of deep venous 
thrombosis. 
(Please note that these findings were similar to an ultrasound 
of the RLE performed on ___ for a similar indication).
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ male with dementia, ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 50%, DM, CKD, 
and relatively recent diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma/bladder 
mass, admitted with increasing fatigue and somnolence for three 
weeks, eventually thought most likely related to MRSA UTI.
.
#Fatigue/somnolence - A broad differential was considered, 
including possible toxic or metabolic causes. The patient's 
electrolytes were normalized and folate, B12, TSH, free T4, RPR, 
and LFTs (including ammonia) were all checked and were within 
normal limits. An initial infectious workup was negative. The 
neurology service was consulted as the patient was initially 
referred in from neurology clinic and due to concern of dilation 
of the lateral ventricles on head CT. Their impression was that 
an element of NPH was a possible contributing factor to the 
patient's presentation, but that this was unlikely to be the 
only cause. Additionally, effective evaluation of NPH would 
require the patient to be as well and stable as possible, and 
able to walk, so that he could undergo detailed testing before 
and after LP with CSF removal. An additional complication was 
that the question of NPH had been raised to the patient when he 
was more lucid, and he declined to undergo evaluation stating he 
would not want surgery for shunt placement. Outpatient neurology 
follow-up was suggested. After several days in the hospital the 
patient developed a fever, and an ongoing infectious work-up was 
continued. A urine culture eventually grew out >100,000 colonies 
of MRSA. With treatment of this infection, the patient's mental 
status improved significantly, although his overall level of 
interaction and verbal communication remained fairly low. Per 
his son, this was close to his initial baseline several weeks 
before the deterioration leading to his admission. It seems 
likely that an element of depression may also be contributing to 
the patient's overall picture; consideration was given to 
possible initiation of pharmacotherapy (such as methylphenidate 
or mirtazapine), however ultimately this was deferred, at least 
temporarily, while the patient's other medical issues reach 
resolution.
.  
#Fevers/UTI: Beginning on the patient's third hospital day, he 
began experiencing fevers. An infectious work-up, including two 
UAs, was non-revealing. He received approximately two days of 
empiric vancomycin and Zosyn out of concern for impending 
clinical deterioration. Eventually his urine culture grew MRSA, 
and this was felt to be the source of his fevers. He was at risk 
for MRSA having had urologic procedures in the last few months, 
as well as Foley catheter placement during this hospitalization. 
His catheter was removed, his antibiotic therapy narrowed to 
vancomycin alone, and his fevers resolved. Several days later, 
lower-grade temperature returned (as high as 100.8). A repeat 
infectious and non-infectious work-up was again undertaken, 
which did not reveal a cause. Drug fever was felt to be a 
possibility, and vancomycin was stopped after seven days of 
total therapy. He promptly defervesced with this and had no 
further elevated temperatures prior to discharge. 
.
#RLE and knee swelling: This was first noted several days into 
the patient's hospitalization. It began with warmth and swelling 
of the patient's right knee. An x-ray was obtained demonstrating 
the presence of previously placed orthopedic hardware and 
degenerative changes. A RLE ultrasound was negative for clot. 
The right knee was tapped on ___ to differentiate between 
gout versus possible septic arthritis; the tap was consistent 
with gout. Over the next several days, the patient developed 
ascending edema of the RLE. A repeat ultrasound was again 
obtained, to evaluate both for thrombus or a possible 
compressive pelvic mass; neither of these were identified. In 
the last two days of hospitalization, the swelling appeared to 
improve mildly. Of note, the patient had been off his diuretics 
given his renal failure. If this swelling continues to persist, 
an abdominal CT scan should be considered, however this was not 
pursued prior to discharge given the patient's rapidly changing 
renal function.
.
#Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline SCr is thought to 
be approximately 1.3-1.4. At admission, his creatinine was 
mildly elevated at 1.6. His furosemide and ___ were held. His 
creatinine subsequently improved, however several days into his 
hospitalization he was noted to have an unexplained bump in both 
his SCr (peak 2.7) and his LFTs (predominantly a transaminitis, 
peak ALT 458, peak AST 867). The etiology of both these 
processes was unclear, however they appeared to be most 
consistent with an ischemic episode of some kind (of note, no 
hypotensive episodes, even mild hypotension, were ever 
documented). Cardiac biomarkers were cycled and an echo was 
obtained, both of which were non-revealing. The patient's renal 
function and LFTs improved (SCr back to 1.5). Later on his 
hospital course, his renal failure worsened again slightly; this 
was thought to be due to poor PO intake and responded to fluid 
administration.
.
#Transient rise in LFTs: Please see section on acute renal 
failure as above. This was thought to be related to transient 
hepatorenal ischemia, although the exact etiology was not 
completely clear.
.
#Poor PO intake/electrolyte abnormalities: The patient was felt 
to have poor PO intake throughout his stay, primarily related to 
his mental status. Without IV fluid support, he would trend 
towards a pre-renal, hypernatremic picture (serum Na 146 on day 
of discharge). The patient would respond well to feeding by 
family members and the nursing staff. It is hoped that with 
rehabilitation and further improvement in his mental status, his 
ability to take POs will improve.
.
#Aspiration: The patient is felt to aspirate his sections and 
oral intake frequently. He was empirically placed on a pureed 
and thickened diet, which seemed to improve this issue somewhat. 
His did not have a formal Speech and Swallow evaluation and it 
was thought unlikely this would change the nature of his care. 
He was not thought to have frank aspiration pneumonia at any 
point in his stay.
.
#Pruritus/rash: This was a chronic issue for the patient, 
beginning many months ago. Dermatology was consulted since the 
patient was itching his skin to the extent breakdown was 
occurring. Topical therapies, including triamcinolone as needed, 
were recommended and are included in the discharge medication 
list. 
.
#Conjunctivitis/corneal abrasion: The patient had seen his 
optometrist just prior to admission and was thought to have a 
left sided conjunctivitis. In the hospital, he was empirically 
treated with erythromycin ointment and tobramycin drops. His 
right eye was also bothering him, and ophthalmology was 
eventually consulted. The patient was found to have a right eye 
corneal abrasion, probably caused when the patient was 
scratching. An eye patch and keeping the eye lid closed were 
recommended; antibiotic drops were also initiated. The patient 
is scheduled for ophthalmology follow-up at ___ tomorrow, 
___.
.
#Hematuria/urothelial cell carcinoma: The patient had been 
previously known to have a bladder mass; this was diagnosed as a 
carcinoma by urine cytology shortly before admission. At 
admission, the patient was having significant hematuria. A Foley 
catheter was placed to allow for flushing of the bladder; his 
hematuria persisted, and he eventually required continuous 
irrigation for several days. In this setting, he required a 
total of three units pRBCs transfusion (two units, followed by 
an additional unit several days later). His hematuria improved 
significantly and all catheters were able to be discontinued 
within approximately the first week of his stay. The patient has 
planned urology follow-up for resection of the mass in the 
coming weeks.
.
#anemia: This was thought to be multifactorial in etiology 
(iron-deficiency, chronic blood loss, chronic disease). The 
patient's HCT ranged in the mid-20s for most of his stay, with 
one dip as low as 21 while he was having hematuria. This 
responded to RBC transfusion.  
.  
#Ischemic cardiomyopathy: The patient was felt to by dry to 
euvolemic during most of his admission, despite the holding of 
his furosemide (and ___ due to his ARF. He also tolerated the 
administration of several liters of fluid without any evidence 
of volume overload except, possible, his RLE swelling. An echo 
was checked and was unchanged. He was continued on his home beta 
blocker and ASA.
.  
#CAD: The patient's home ASA, beta blocker and statin were 
continued.
.  
#DM: The patient's home glipizide was held. He was managed with 
fixed dose/sliding scale insulin. 
.  
#HTN: As above, the patient's home beta blocker was continued 
but his ___ was held. He was mildly hypertensive during his stay 
but not to a degree that required intervention.
.

ECG ___:
Normal sinus rhythm. Tracing is within normal limits. No 
previous tracing available for comparison.  

Chest (PA & LAT) ___:
UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: The heart size is 
normal. The aorta is slightly unfolded. The mediastinal and 
hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. Within the medial 
aspect of the right lung base, there is a focal rounded opacity 
identified. The left lung is clear. No pneumothorax or pleural 
effusion is present. There are no acute osseous findings. 
  
IMPRESSION: Rounded opacity projecting over the medial right 
lung base, which could represent an area of inflammation or 
infection. However, the rounded morphology may be suggestive of 
an underlying mass lesion, and further evaluation with CT is 
recommended. 

CTA Chest ___:
CTA CHEST: The pulmonary arterial vasculature is normally 
opacified to the subsegmental level, without evidence of filling 
defect to suggest pulmonary embolism. The aorta is normal in 
size and caliber without acute aortic pathology. The remaining 
great mediastinal vessels are normal.  
  
In the right lower lobe, there is a large consolidative opacity, 
measuring approximately 8.6 x 6.8 cm in maximum cross-sectional 
dimension (image 3:87).  Pulmonary arterial branches normally 
traverse through the consolidation area, compatible with the ""CT 
angiogram sign"". There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. 
No other pulmonary nodule or mass is noted.  
  
The heart is normal in size without pericardial effusion. The 
central tracheobronchial tree is patent. There is no 
mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy. 
  
The study is not designed for subdiaphragmatic diagnosis. A 
subcentimeter hypodensity in the right hepatic lobe (image 
3:106) is too small to be fully characterized and a sub-cm 
hypodensity in the left lobe of the liver (3:100) is likely a 
cyst. The right adrenal is not visualized. The left adrenal is 
only partially imaged, but no abnormality is noted. 
  
BONE WINDOW: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions. 

  
IMPRESSION: 
1. No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology. 
2. Right lower lobe airspace consolidation, with demonstration 
of the ""CT angiogram"" sign. Differential diagnosis includes 
pneumonia, bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, and lymphoma. Recommend 
followup imaging after treatment to ensure clearance. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo female with DM I, osteopenia, recent L olecranon fracture 
fix 2 weeks ago presenting with SOB, fever, cough, and found to 
have RLL opacity on CXR  
.  
# Fever: Pt presented with fever, cough, SOB, and pain on deep 
inspiration consistent with pneumonia.  CXR and CTA chest 
revealed RLL opacity concerning for PNA.  (In setting of recent 
surgery of olecranon fracture, CTA chest was performed to rule 
out PE.)  However, given atypical appearance of consolidation, 
malignancy could not be ruled out.  Pt was advised to have 
repeat imaging upon resolution of pneumonia and was scheduled 
for outpatient CT chest.  She was started on oral levofloxacin 
for CAP.  Gram stain of sputum revealed 1+ gram positive cocci 
in pairs; culture grew sparse commensal respiratory flora.  
Urine legionella was negative.  Despite her recent hospital 
stay, she was not started on treatment for HCAP as she appeared 
nontoxic and improved significantly over 24 hours on 
levofloxacin.  She was discharged home with instructions to 
complete a 7 day course of levofloxacin.  
.  
# Left olecranon fracture: Pt reported having been at an OSH for 
two days for surgery for her left olecranon fracture two weeks 
prior to presentation to ___.  Left arm was kept in a sling.  
She reported no pain in the arm.  Incision was clean, dry, and 
intact.

during her hospital stay.  Per protocol, she was evaluated by 
the ___ diabetes team and seen by the nutritionist.  Per 
___ recs, she was continued on her home pump settings as 
blood glucose remained grossly within target range.  She was 
continued on her home aspirin.  
.  
# Depression: No acute issues.  She was continued on her home 
citalopram  
.  
# Osteopenia: Pt had history of multiple fractures, most 
recently a fracture of her left olecranon which was repaired two 
weeks prior to admission.  She was continued on her calcium and 
vitamin D.  She was also taking alendronate once a week which 
should be continued as outpatient.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ F w/ PMHx of HTN, HLD, PVD, COPD, history 
of rectal cancer, and anemia who presented from cardiology 
clinic with symptoms of dizziness in setting of new onset atrial 
fibrillation found to have over-repletion of thyroid hormone, 
hospital course complicated by acute pulmonary edema.  

# Acute Pulmonary Edema: Early on the morning of ___, the 
patient woke up acutely short of breath and hypertensive to 
systolics of 200. A chest x-ray showed worsened pulmonary edema 
in RLL. She was treated with 40mg IV Lasix and a nitroglycerin 
drip. She required BiPAP and was transferred to the CCU where 
she was treated with 3 additional doses of 40mg IV lasix over 
the course of 2 days. She only required BiPAP for 6 hours, and 
was then weaned to nasal cannula oxygen supplementation. 
Nitroglycerin drip was weaned off and home dose amlodipine was 
restarted. Review of the TTE showed 3+ MR ___ etiology thought 
to be possible flail mitral valve leaflet) as the presumed 
cauase for the patient's acute pulmonary edema. The patient 
continued to received IV furosemide on the floor with 
improvement in oxygen requirement with the patient on RA on the 
day of discharge. The patient was transitioned to PO torsemide 
___. The patient was started on losartan for after load 
reduction as well as metoprolol. Weight on day of discharge: 
47.7kg.

# Atrial fibrillation: CHADS-2 score of 2; patient has never had 
a stroke or TIA in the past. Patient was rate controlled on 
metoprolol XL 100mg and converted to sinus rhythm on the morning 
of ___. Thyroid function testing revealed over repletion which 
may have been the etiology for new afib. Levothyroxine dose was 
decreased to 112mcg daily (from 135mcg). TFTs should be repeated 
in 6 weeks for discharge from ___ on this new dose. 
Anticoagulation was discussed with the patient's outpatient 
providers (Cardiology and Primary care physician); given the 
patient's history of falls, the decision was made to use full 
strength aspirin for anticoagulation.  Patient's metoprolol was 
decreased to 50mg metoprolol XL in light of development of acute 
pulmonary edema. 

# Pyuria: Early during admission, patient had UA suggestive of 
UTI with 49 WBC and few bacteria. Urine culture with less than 
10,000 organisms. Patient received 3 days of ciprofloxacin.  

# MRSA cystitis: Patient had Foley catheter placed during 
admission while being digressed. The patient's UA was suggestive 
of UTI but patient without white count when debris noted in the 
Foley catheter. Foley was discontinued. Urine culture showed 
MRSA, and patient complained of symptoms of dysuria. 
Sensitivities showed that MRSA was sensitive to Bactrim DS BID; 
patient was started on Bactrim ___. Blood cultures 
pending; repeat urine culture at time of discharge pending. Plan 
for 7 day course of Bactrim DS BID with day one being ___.

# PVD: ASA 325mg PO daily. The patient was started on 
pravastatin, which she should continue as an outpatient.
 
# HTN: The patient's home amlodipine was discontinued during 
this admission, while metoprolol was started and adjusted. With 
the development of acute pulmonary edema (see discussion above), 
metoprolol was decreased and ___ (losartan) was started for 
afterload reduction. ___ as opposed to ACEi was started given 
the patient's underlying cough.
 
# Hypothyroidism: TSH 0.091, FT4 2.1, consistent with 
over-repletion. Decreased levothyroxine from 135mcg daily to 
112mcg daily. Recheck TFTs in 6 weeks from discharge from acute 
hosptialization and adjust dose appropriately.
 
# Anemia: CBC stable through admission. Continued home iron 
supplementation. Patient due for B12 injection per daughter 
which she received during this admission. 

# COPD: Continued home tiotropium, Symbicort and albuterol.

# Thoracic spine area skin breakdown: Patient with Mepilex 
placed. Trending exam. Encourage ambulation. 

# CODE STATUS: FULL CODE. There had been discussion with patient 
regarding her code status. She had expressed desire to be 
DNR/DNI though patient's daughter had much difficulty accepting 
this code status. On-going discussions regarding code status 
will need to be carried out upon discharge from hospital.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-Monitor weight daily, if weight increases by 3 pounds, then 
increase dose of torsemide to 40mg PO daily. 
-Serum ___ to evaluate serum creatinine and serum lytes. 
Forward to ___ MD for review.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old pleasant lady who presents with history of 
worsening cough and shortness of breath on exersion as well as 
urinary frequency. The patient was previous prescribed 
levofloxacin and Z-pack prior to admission. However one day 
before admission her symptoms became worse prompting her to see 
her PCP who referred her to the ED. 

# UTI: Her admission labs were notable for a UA suggesting a UTI 
and an elevated Cr to 1.8. She was started on PO Cipro for a 
presumed UTI. First urine culture returned negative but pt still 
reported urinary sx so a second urine culture was sent and is 
pending at time of discharge. She completed a 5-day course of 
Cipro while in-house and her Cr improved with IV fluids. 
Discharge Cr was 1.1.   

# COPD exacerbation: pt's wheezing thought most likely to be 
COPD exacerbation. Her CXR excluded pneumonia, and her blood 
culture excluded sepsis. Since the patient recently finished a 
course of azithromycin prior to admission she was only started 
on a prednisone taper. She was discharged on a prolonged taper 
as discussed with her outpatient pulmonologist Dr. ___. 

# constipation: pt was put on bowel regimen including 
senna/Colace, lactulose, psyllium when she reported she had not 
had ostomy output for 5 days. She typically has ostomy output 
every 3 days. She will continue on senna/Colace in the 
outpatient setting. 

# urinary retention: pt was found to have persistently have high 
post-void residuals and required straight cathing. This was 
thought to be a chronic issue based on her history of UTIs and 
pyuria. She should be bladder scanned in rehab and will follow 
up with urology in the outpatient setting to discuss further 
workup. 

CHRONIC ISSUES: 

# anemia: hemoglobin trended down mildly but remained close to 
pt's baseline. Anemia is believed to be a combination of iron 
deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease. She received a 
unit of pRBCs for a  Hgb of 7.3, but should follow up with her 
primary care doctor about reinitiating EPO. 

# diastolic CHF: the most recent echo in ___ showed EF >55% 
and LVH with moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation. The 
pt did not have s/s of CHF exacerbation in house. She was 
restarted on her torsemide at a reduced dose of 10 mg twice 
weekly. 

# anxiety: pt was discontinued from lorazepam and did not 
require treatment for anxiety

# HLD: continued home pravastatin 

# HTN: continued home metoprolol 

# hypothyroidism: continued home SYnthroid. TSH here was 3.2. 

# ostomy care: wound consult was placed for concern for sores 
around the ostomy site. The pt reports that in the past she has 
received chromalin spray that was helpful for addressing the 
sores. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUE:
=========================
- steroid taper: prednisone 40 mg for a total of 5 days then 
transition to prednisone 20 mg for another 5 days. Pt should 
continue on 30mg/day for 3 days, 20mg/day for 3 days, then 
10mg/day for 3 days, then 5mg/day for 3 days and follow up with 
Dr. ___. 
- Torsemide dose on discharge: 10 mg. Pt should take torsemide 
twice weekly as needed. 
- urine culture: pt has urine culture from ___ pending at time 
of discharge. Please follow this up. 
- urinary retention: pt found to have persistently elevated 
post-void residuals and required straight cathing. She seems to 
have h/o chronic urinary retention. She should follow up with 
urology for question of cystoscopy. She should get bladder scans 
TID and be straight cathed for PVR >500 at rehab. 
- EPO injections: pt found to have anemia of chronic disease and 
started on iron, B12 and folate supplements. Per discussion with 
pt, she should follow up with PCP to discuss whether to continue 
EPO injections for her anemia (she hasn't received any in about 
___ years). She did receive 1 U pRBCs while inpatient. 
- medication changes: consider discontinuing donepezil as pt 
does not appear to have dementia as she has relatively high 
functional status (able to use phone, engage appropriately in 
conversation etc). Pt's lorazepam was d/c'ed as she did not 
require it in house.

The patient is interviewed with her daughter at bedside. They 
reports that her symptoms started four to five days prior to 
presenatation with general feeling of unwell, and significant 
cough. Sought assessment at ___ in ___. CXR reportedly 
without e/o of pneumonia. Given chronic azithro and negative 
radiographic findings, no escalation of antibiotics. Per NP 
note, HR noted to be 120+; dig added, no changes to patient's

increased sputum production, and characterizes the color and 
green; denies sinus pain. Endorses sick contacts at her nursing 
home. Has been using Duonebs at home QID, with some initial 
improvement of her symptoms, but then became more resistant. 
Denied objective fevers. Treated with UTI last week with unknown 
antibiotic. 

Was prompted to come into the ED because of escalating shortness 
of breath and chest discomfort. Patient denies chest discomfort 
for my interview, but per the ED, she had characterized the cp 
as bilateral chest pressure.

Dtr reports new per-istomal wounds since ___, but has not 
reevaled them since then. Patient endorses pain around ostomy 
site. Endorses suprapubic leakage but no pain; endorses some 
feeling of discomfort and urgency given the bulb in the 
catheter. States that were schedule to have it replaced by 
Urology this week.  Denies back pain. Denies diarrhea. Denies 
weight gain, rather states she has had 30lb weight loss for 
several months, and keeps losing weight. Dtr endorses poor oral 
intake. 

At 0200, patient complained of L mid axillary line chest 
discomfort at ~10th rib, not reproduced with palpation; pt 
denied sob, diaphoresis, nausea, although dtr state that she saw 
the patient have increased effort of breathing and wheezing. EKG 
without change from prior.

Imaging:
========
___ CXR:
Mild cardiomegaly, as seen previously, with mild pulmonary 
vascular 
congestion, but no frank pulmonary edema.  Small bilateral 
pleural effusions with patchy bibasilar opacities, potentially 
atelectasis, but infection or aspiration is not excluded in the 
correct clinical setting.

___ CT Head:
1. No acute intracranial abnormalities. 
2. Global parenchymal volume loss and sequela of chronic small 
vessel ischemic disease.

___ TTE:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Diastolic function could 
not be assessed. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, 
ascending and arch levels are normal. The number of aortic valve 
leaflets cannot be determined. There is no aortic valve 
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the 
eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be 
significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). Moderate to severe 
[3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least 
moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to 
a very high right atrial pressure.] There is no pericardial 
effusion. 

IMPRESSION: 
1) Normal biventricular regional/global systolic function.
2) At least moderate mitral regurgitation (difficult to assess 
due to Coanda effect) due to possibly partial anterior mitral 
valve leaflet flail.
3) Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation with normal RV 
size/function in setting of at least mild elevation of RV 
afterload.

___ CXR:
Small left pleural effusion has increased.  Increased left 
basilar opacity, may represent atelectasis or developing 
pneumonia.

___ KUB:
IMPRESSION: 
1. No abnormally dilated loops of small or large bowel to 
suggest obstruction. 
2. Enteric tube terminates in stable position in the expected 
position of the stomach body. 

___ CXR:
IMPRESSION:    
COMPARED TO CHEST RADIOGRAPHS SINCE ___, MOST RECENTLY 
___. 
  
LUNGS ARE CLEAR ON ___.  ON ___ BIBASILAR 
OPACIFICATION HAD DEVELOPED ALONG WITH AN INCREASE IN SMALL 
BILATERAL PLEURAL EFFUSIONS. CONSOLIDATIONS IMPROVED ON ___, BUT SUBSEQUENTLY FIRST CONSOLIDATION IN THE LEFT LOWER LOBE 
AND NOW IN THE RIGHT LOWER LOBE HAD DEVELOPED, PROBABLY 
PNEUMONIA.  THERE IS NO PULMONARY EDEMA.  PLEURAL EFFUSIONS 
REMAIN SMALL.

valvular heart disease (3+ MR/2+TR per ___ TTE), and atrial 
fibrillation, remote h/o colorectal cancer s/p ostomy, and 
suprapubic catheter, who presented with malaise x 4 days, 
hyponatremia, and new onset cough and dyspnea, thought to be 
secondary to pulmonary edema as well as pneumonia. Hospital 
course complicated by epigastric pain/ileus thought to be 
secondary to initiation of diltiazem, which improved, and new 
pneumonia noted on CXR prior to discharge.

# Dyspnea:
# Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: presented with worsening 
dyspnea. Also endorsed orthopnea, and BNP > 11,000 (previously 
1800 one year ago). CXR with mild opacities, possible 
atelectasis vs. aspiration vs. infection as well as pulmonary 
vascular congestion. TTE did not reveal any new systolic 
dysfunction. Overall her dyspnea was thought to be secondary to 
mild fluid overload, aspiration, and possibly URI/mild 
pneumonia. She was initially treated broadly with vanc and 
levofloxacin 750 mg PO Q48H. Vancomycin was discontinued given 
negative MRSA swab and she completed a 5 day course of 
levofloxacin finishing on ___. She was diuresed with IV Lasix 
boluses 20mg BID until she developed an increase in her 
creatinine. Home torsemide was re-intiated at same dose as 
prior, and patient appeared euvolemic at time of discharge. 2 
days prior to discharge, new area of likely pneumonia seen on 
CXR. Patient without fever, and good O2 sat on RA. Started 
ceftriaxone, transitioned to cefpodoxime for total ___nding ___ (see transitional issues below).
- Discharge Cr: 0.9
- Discharge weight: 39.3 kg (bed weight, may not be accurate)

# Fever: 100.7 on ___. CXR revealed likely atelectasis but 
could not rule out infection. Blood cultures were sent and were 
no growth at time of discharge. She had a grossly positive UA, 
expected given suprapubic catheter. Urine culture with no growth 
and no GU symptoms at time of discharge.

# Epigastric pain / Illeus: Patient developed significant 
abdominal pain and distension requiring NG tube placement 4 days 
prior to discharge, with improvement in symptoms after 
suctioning. Thought to be secondary to initiation of diltiazem, 
and diltiazem was d/c'ed and metoprolol reinitiated (see below). 
Epigastric pain improved and patient was drinking adequately, 
and drinking small amounts prior to discharge.

# Atrial fibrillation: RVR on arrival, improved with diltiazem 
IV and then PO diltiazem. The timing of diltiazem initiation 
coincided with GI symptoms (per above) and so this was stopped, 
and metoprolol was restarted at a higher dose with good effect, 
and HR was in the ___ to low 100s. She had recently been started 
on digoxin at urgent care. This was initially stopped but then 
restarted due to difficulty controlling rates during 
hospitalization.

# Hyponatremia: presented with serum Na of 118. Urine Na was 116 
prior to Lasix, likely SIADH. Patient reports recently 
increasing her free water intake which may explain acute onset. 
Na normalized with free water restriction.
 
# Chest pain: troponins negative x 4, poor historian. EKG was 
without ischemic changes. Likely musculoskeletal/epigastric 
pain.

# COPD: Gold stage II on chronic azithromycin. No wheezing on 
exam without evidence of active COPD exacerbation. Continued 
home tiotropium bromide 1 cap daily, ipratroprium-albuterol neb 
Q6H, and albuterol nebs prn. Home symbicort was non formulary 
and she was treated with inhaled fluticasone. 

# Ostomy: patient with peristomal raised lesions. Seen by 
colorectal surgery who recommended dermatology consult to rule 
out malignancy. They felt that this was not urgent andcould be 
done as outpatient. ___ require treatment with steroids

Transitional Issues:
====================
- INCREASED metoprolol succinate to 100mg in setting of afib w 
RVR. Initially changed to diltiazem but d/c'ed diltiazem due to 
abd symptoms (see above) 
- STARTED digoxin 0.25mg
- Patient noted to aspirate on speech and swallow evaluation. 
Should take only thickened liquids
- Please check video swallow once patient fully stable as 
outpatient, per recommendation of speech and swallow
- Discharged on 1.5L fluid restriction - hyponatremic on 
admission with Na of 118. Urine lytes consistent with SIADH. 
- CONTINUE home dose of torsemide 
- Please coordinate non-urgent dermatology evaluation for 
periostomal ulcers, may need steroid treatment
- RECHECK TSH as an outpatient. Borderline low on admission at 
0.32, consider decreasing dose of levothyroxine as outpatient 
given RVR on presentation (although more likely secondary to 
volume overload)
- STARTED cefpodoxime day for 5 days (first day ___, last day 
___
- HELD azithromycin (chronic UTI suppression) given on 
cefpodoxime and given its interaction with donepezil. Consider 
restarting. Please check EKG prior for QTc monitoring

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking part in your care while you were in the 
hospital. You were admitted because you were feeling short of 
breath. You were found to have a low sodium level, but this 
rapidly improved. You were given IV medication to remove fluid 
from around the lungs. You were also given antibiotics for a 
mild pneumonia. During the hospitalization, your heart rates 
increased, requiring adjustment of your medications as listed 
below. Your metoprolol dose was increased, and a drug, digoxin, 
was started. You also were noted to have abdominal pain and 
distension, and a nasogastric tube was placed to decompress your 
stomach, and improved your discomfort. At that time, a 
medication, diltiazem was stopped, as it was thought to be 
contributing to your stomach discomfort.

You likely developed a new mild pneumonia, and were treated 
first with and IV antibiotic, and one to take by mouth at the 
rehab. Your breathing was good without the need for additional 
oxygen at the time of your discharge from the hospital. Your 
abdominal discomfort improved as well.

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO AFTER LEAVING THE HOSPITAL:
1. Do not drink more than 1.5 liters of fluid a day
2. Drink only thickened liquids

Again, it has been a pleasure taking part in your care, and we 
wish you the best.

- Your ___ care team

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure treating you for flu and pneumonia. When you 
arrived at ___, you tested positive for the flu which was 
causing a fever as well as some confusion and tiredness. Your 
initial chest x-ray showed improvement of your prior pneumonia. 
While being treated for the flu and dehydration with Tamiflu and 
IV fluids, you developed a new pneumonia that was seen on a 
second chest x-ray and required antibiotics and fluids. Due to 
decreased oral intake of food and beverage, you developed 
elevated levels of sodium in your blood, which improved after 
you were given IV fluids.

Please weigh yourself every morning, and call your doctor if 
your weight goes up more than 3 lbs. Please continue to take all 
your regular medications, and follow up at any appointments that 
are scheduled. 

Again, it has been a pleasure taking part in your care, and we 
wish you the best.
- Your ___ care team

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 
It was a pleasure caring for you during your recent 
hospitalization for shortness of breath and chest tightness.  
You did not appear to have any emergent heart problems causing 
these symptoms, but given your history of cardiac disease, we 
recommend getting a pharmacologic stress test as an outpatient 
then following up with your outpatient cardiologist.

Please also restrict your water intake to 1.5 L a day if 
possible.  Feel free to liberalize your salt intake as long as 
your shortness of breath does not get worse and you do not 
develop swelling or weight gain.  This should help with your low 
sodiums.

TRANSITION OF CARE ISSUES
- Discuss with your PCP how to optimize your treatment of COPD, 
which may include starting a long-acting inhaled medication
- You should have the levels of sodium and potassium in your 
blood checked and followed by your PCP.  
- You are scheduled for a pharmacologic stress test on ___, 
___, at 9:20.  Please attend the appointment listed 
below.  You will discuss the results of the stress test with 
your outpatient cardiologist

MEDICATION CHANGES
- STOP lisinopril for now - this medication can cause high 
potassium levels.  Discuss with your PCP whether you should 
restart this medication

Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with known CAD s/p multiple DES, mild 
AR, HTN, HLD, CKD, and HIV p/w resting chest pain relieved by 
nitro and EKG changes suggestive of ACS/unstable angina.
  
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Unstable Angina:The patient presented with unstable angina and 
TW flattening. Trops negative x3. He underwent cardiac 
catheterization  that showed the LAD had mid-vessel disease with 
50% eccentric plaque, with large diagonal branch that was 
bifurcating. The proximal segment had 40% diffuse then 
bifurcated to an upper pole (with patent stent) and lower pole 
(with diffuse70-80% disease). The LCx had mid 90% focal lesion 
proximal to the OM1 origin. The proximal OM2 had 70% proximal to 
the bifurcation. RCA was tortuous with 40% disease at the 
proximal stent edge. He had successful PTCA and stenting of the 
mid LCX and placement of DES. Three days after his 
catheterization, he developed severe chest pain with ST 
depressions laterally so he was taken to the catheterization lab 
for a re-look via the radial artery where his stents were patent 
and there were no thrombus or changes. It was decided to treat 
him medically. His blood pressure regimen was modified (see 
below), his statin was changed to atorvastatin 80mg and he will 
be on lifelong asa and clopidogrel x ___ year. He will have a 
P-MIBI in ___ weeks to assess further his mid LAD and diag 
lesions.

# Acute on chronic kidney disease: The patient's Cr rose to 1.9 
in the setting of two cardiac catheterization. He received IVF 
and the Cr downtrended by discharge (1.7).

# Leg pain: On ___, the patient reported acute ___ left leg 
pain that radiated from his hip to his ankle. Pulse exam 
unchanged. His left femoral artery had been used for access for 
his first cardiac catheterization but this was on ___. He was 
initially started on a heparin gtt but given arterial and venous 
ultrasounds were normal, this was discontinued. The pain 
improved with morphine x1 and he was walking comfortably later 
in the day. This etiology of this pain was unclear (although 
patient has known HIV vasculopathy) but did not recur.

#Hypertension: The patient was hypertensive to the 190s during 
this admission. His amlodipine was increased to 10mg and he was 
started on carvedilol 25mg BID (instead of metoprolol) and 
hydralazine 75mg q6h (for afterload reduction). Imdur was 
continued at his home dose. He will need close monitoring of his 
blood pressure and may benefit from a renal ultrasound. He may 
also benefit fro ___ (review of records showed he had 
hyperkalemia in ___ while on lisinopril) once his kidney 
function normalizes.

# Diarrhea: The patient had intermittent diarrhea ___ bowel 
movements in a row) which is reportedly chronic and for which he 
takes loperamide. If this continues, he may benefit from further 
GI evaluation of his diarrhea.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
# HIV: CD4 count of 538. Continued on home regimen. 

# Hepatitis C: He is genotype 1A HCV c/b cirrhosis, stable 
without evidence of clinically significant portal hypertension 
or synthetic dysfunction

# Urinary retention: Continued home oxybutynin.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
- He will need continued blood pressure management. Consider 
renal ultrasound to evaluate for RAS or restarting an ___ or 
___ once his kidney function has improved.
- pMIBI to assess mid LAD and diag lesions in ___ weeks
- He may benefit from further evaluation of his diarrhea if it 
persists
- He will need to take clopidogrel ___ year and asa 81mg lifelong

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the ___ 
with chest pain. A cardiac catheterization was performed which 
revealed a blockage in your heart vessel which was treated with 
a drug eluting stent. It is very important that you take your 
aspirin and plavix every day and if you feel you are running out 
on these medicines, you must call your cardiologist to get a 
refill. Not taking these medicines can result in re-blockage of 
the stent. Please followup with your cardiologist as an 
outpatient in several weeks and they request that you have 
stress test prior to this visit. 

Also, please check your blood pressures twice daily after you 
leave the hospital. You to can purchase an automatic blood 
pressure cuff at ___ Pharmacy and if your blood pressures are 
regularly greater than 160 systolic (the top number), or less

IMAGING/STUDIES:
==================

Persantine MIBI (___):
INTERPRETATION: This ___ year old man with h/o HTN, HLD, CKD, and 
 PVD; s/p MI in ___ and stents in ___ and ___ with known CAD 
was referred to the lab for evaluation of chest pain. The 
patient exercised for 8 minutes of a Modified Gervino protocol 
(~ ___ METS), representing a poor exercise tolerance for his 
age. The test was stopped due to fatigue. No chest, neck, back, 
or arm discomforts were reported by the patient throughout the 
study. At peak exercise, there was 0.5 mm of upsloping ST 
segment depression isolated to lead V6, resolving by 15 seconds 
of recovery. The rhythm was sinus with frequent, isolated APBs, 
including multiple prolonged periods of bigeminy. Appropriate 
blood pressure response to exercise. Blunted heart rate response 
to exercise in the presence of beta blocker therapy.  
IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or objective evidence of 
myocardial ischemia. Frequent atrial ectopy. 

CXR (___):
AP portable upright view of the chest.   Spinal fusion hardware 
partially 
imaged in the neck. The heart remains mildly enlarged. 
Mediastinal contours stable. Mild silhouetting of the right 
heart border is unchanged likely reflecting the presence of a 
fat pad. The lungs are clear without focal consolidation, large 
effusion or pneumothorax. No convincing signs of edema. Bony 
structures are intact. No free air below the right 
hemidiaphragm.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ gentleman with a history of CAD, 
HTN, CKD, diastolic HF, PVD, and HIV (last CD4 count 538 in 
___ who presents with chest pain.  

# Chest pain:  Patient reported substernal chest pain similar to 
the pain at the time his last DES was placed, very concerning 
for unstable angina.  His troponin was mildly elevated at 0.02 
(in the setting of CKD) but remained stable.  An EKG showed no 
ischemic changes.  Patient's chest pain resolved in the ED after 
SL NTG and morphine.  A myocardial perfusion study revealed no 
anginal type symptoms or objective evidence of myocardial 
ischemia.  His chest pain may have been related to underlying 
LVH in the setting of worsening anemia.  He was continued on 
ASA, Plavix, carvedilol, and pravastatin 20 mg daily and 
scheduled for follow-up with cardiology. 

# Diastolic heart failure:  Patient appeared mildly hypervolemic 
on admission but was euvolemic on discharge.  Lasix 40 mg was 
continued.  Given orthostasis and hyperkalemia, losartan was 
held and isosorbide mononitrate was reduced from 120 mg to 90 mg 
daily. 

# Chronic kidney disease c/b hyperkalemia:  Creatinine on 
admission was 2.1, stable from 2.0 in ___.  Creatinine in 
___ ranged from 1.3-1.5.  This likely represents progression of 
his underlying CKD.  K was 5.8 on admission, 5.5 on discharge.  
This was likely a combination of CKD and losartan, which was 
discontinued.  Patient was instructed to have labs rechecked on 
___ at ___'s office. 

# Hypertension:  Patient's blood pressure was well-controlled.  
He was continued on carvedilol, diltiazem, and hydralazine.  
Given symptomatic orthostasis, isosorbide mononitrate was 
decreased from 120 mg to 90 mg daily and losartan was 
discontinued.

# Anemia: H/H 8.8/27.6 from 9.6/30.8 in ___.  Likely related 
to known anemia of chronic disease, HIV, CKD.  No reports of 
melena or hematochezia, guaiac negative.  Chest pain may be 
exacerbated by anemia and patient may benefit from EPO.

# HIV:  Patient was continued on efavirenz, lamivudine 
(appropriately renally dosed), and abacavir. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
========================
[ ] Given orthostasis and hyperkalemia (K 5.5 on discharge), 
losartan was discontinued and isosorbide mononitrate was reduced 
from 120 mg to 90 mg daily.
[ ] Consider referral to renal for consideration of EPO to 
improve anemia, which may improve chest pain.
[ ] Patient was instructed to schedule a PCP appointment on 
___. Please check CBC and chem-10 on ___ to evaluate 
anemia, renal function, electrolytes (given hyperkalemia).
[ ] Patient was instructed to schedule a cardiology appointment 
in the next week to follow-up on medication changes, and titrate 
medications accordingly.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your stay at ___.  
You were admitted for chest pain.  Lab tests and an EKG 
indicated that you did not have a heart attack.  An exercise 
stress test was normal, which means that there are no 
significant blockages of the blood vessels in your heart.  

Your kidney function has worsened since last year and your blood 
counts are very low.  This may be contributing to your chest 
pain.  Your potassium level was also high, which is likely a 
combination of your kidney disease and losartan (which was 
stopped on discharge).  Because your blood pressure dropped on 
standing, the dose of isosorbide mononitrate was reduced.  It is 
very important that you schedule an appointment to see your PCP 
on ___ to have your labs rechecked and to 
review your medications. 

We wish you good health!
Your ___ Team

History of Present Illness:
___ functional man despite complex PMH including HIV (last CD4 
397, VL undetect), HCV cirrhosis, COPD. Reports persistent, 
diffuse, intermittent abdominal pain over past two weeks. Has 
been seen in ED ___, and ___ for same. LAbs notable for 
mildly elevated AST (chronic), mildly elevated lipase (102, 94, 
124, etc, also chronic). CT abd on ___ reportedly without 
pathology to explain his pain. Also with marked abd bloating, 
has been passing flatus. No associated nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, melena, hematochezia. Denies any change in bowel 
habits, having formed brown BMs daily without straining. Reports 
normal appetite, no change in pain with meals, reports he has 
been eating normally. No fevers/chills, no dysuria, some urinary 
straining unchanged from baseline. Pain is worse at night and 
wakens him from sleep. No CP/SOB, reports DOE at baseline due to 
COPD, no change in exercise tolerance. No dizziness or falls. 
Denies prior episodes, though ED notes report pain for several 
months. At home he has tried tylenol, motrin, and tums, all 
without relief. In the ED he has received morphine with 
temporary relief. He was referred by PCP given failure of outpt 
management.  

In the ED, initial vitals:  98.7 67 128/50 16 99%  
meds/fluids administered: morphine 5mg IV, ondansetron 4mg po, 
NS 1L

Currently he reports same abd pain, frustrated with not being 
able to manage or know what is causing it. Hungry, asking for 
food. Has been taking all meds daily as directed, no recent 
changes or new medications. No herbal or other OTC supplements. 
No EtOH in many years. ROS otherwise NC.

CT ABD ___:
COMPARISON:  CT abdomen ___ 
  
FINDINGS:  
CHEST: 
The visualized lung bases are clear. A stent is noted in the 
right coronary 
artery. There is no pericardial effusion. 
  
ABDOMEN: 
This study is slightly limited by the lack of intravenous 
contrast. 
  
The contours of the liver appear slightly nodular, but the 
parenchyma is 
otherwise homogeneous in appearance. The spleen, pancreas, 
bilateral adrenal 
glands, and kidneys appear grossly unremarkable. The small and 
large bowel are 
normal in caliber, without evidence of obstruction.  An 
appendicolith is noted 
in the appendix, which is mildly dilated to 6.9 mm, but there 
are no secondary 
signs of inflammation. There is mild diverticulosis without 
evidence of 
diverticulitis. Small fat containing inguinal hernias are noted 
bilaterally. 
  
There are atherosclerotic calcifications throughout the 
abdominal aorta and 
iliac branches, but there is no evidence of aneurysm formation. 
There is no 
retroperitoneal, pelvic sidewall or inguinal lymphadenopathy by 
CT size 
criteria. There is no free fluid within the abdomen. No 
pneumoperitoneum. 
  
PELVIS: 
The bladder is moderately distended. The prostate is 
unremarkable. No free 
fluid within the pelvis. 
  
MUSCULOSKELETAL: 
There are degenerative changes noted throughout the lumbar and 
sacral spine. 
No evidence of fractures. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
1. No acute intra-abdominal process to explain patient's 
symptoms. 
2. Mildly dilated appendix containing an appendicolith, without 
secondary 
signs of inflammation. 
3. Slightly nodular liver contour, which likely reflects 
underlying liver 
disease 

RUQ US ___:  No evidence of ascites. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT & PLAN:  ___ with chroinc HIV, HCV cirrhosis, COPD, 
HTN, CAD, chronic
diastolic dysfunction, CKD, chronic anemia admitted with 
non-specific gneralized abdominal pain without etiology whihc 
resolved with passing gas and stooling.  Abd US showed no 
ascites.  All of his labs are at their baseline from recent 
levels. A PVR was <100 on repeat, and so his oxybutinin was 
resumed.

symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size, 
and global systolic function (biplane LVEF = 68 %). Doppler 
parameters are most consistent with Grade I (mild) left 
ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber 
size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is 
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
stenosis. Mild to moderate (___) aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not 
be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
normal biventricular regional/global systolic function. Moderate 
left atrial enlargement. Grade I diastolic dysfunction pattern. 
Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, no 
significant change. This study had a higher quality pressure 
half time tracing at 451 ms which falls into the mild to 
moderate severity range. However, visual comparison of the 
aortic regurgitation shows a similar degree of aortic 
regurgitation in both studies.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital for chest pain. We gave you 
medications to help your heart and to treat your pain. Your 
chest pain improved. You were also found to have low blood 
levels, so you received 1 unit of blood cells. You underwent 
cardiac catheterization and a stent was placed in one of the 
vessels of your heart. After the catheterization, you were 
having some hand pain and swelling near the incision site. The 
hand specialists were consulted and assessed your hand regularly 
until the pain and swelling had improved. 

You were started on new medications including plavix 
(clopidogrel). It is very important that you continue to take 
this medication, as well as your home aspirin, to prevent clots 
from forming in your new stent. All of your medications are 
detailed in your discharge medication list. You should review 
this carefully and take it with you to any follow up 
appointments.

The details of your follow up appointments are given below.

It was a pleasure taking care of you.
Sincerely,
Your ___ Cardiology Team

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

 
History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ year old male with history of CAD s/p Promus DES to 
mid-LAD, D1 branch, and distal-RCA on ___, s/p Premier DES 
to ___ on ___, LAD ___, hypertension, HFpEF, CKD, and 
HIV presenting with chest pain.  

 The patient notes his pain was acute in onset this morning 
starting at about 7 AM. He took an aspirin and nitroglycerin 
without relief. He noted the pain to be severe, pressure-like, 
and increaseing with inspiration. He states that this feels like 
his usual anginal symptoms. He denies infectious symptoms, 
radiation to back, and vomiting, or diarrhea, or abdominal pain, 
urinary symptoms, lower extremity swelling, recent increasing 
exertional dyspnea.  

 In the ED initial vitals were:  
 Temp. 97.9 HR 106 BP 157/67 SpO2 97% RA  
 In the ED the patient was noted to appear uncomfortable on 
exam. His chest pain was unresponsive sublingual nitro X 3 and 
morphine so nitro gtt was initiated.  

 Labs were notable for WBC 4.4, Hg 8.2, platelets 110, Na 134, K 
4.4, Cl 103, bicarb 18, BUN 40, Cr 1.5, glucose 116, trop X 1 
negative, MB 3, D-dimer 373, BNP 173, UA negative for infection 
with 100 protein. 
 
 CXR showed: Right costophrenic angle most likely reflects  
 pleural thickening. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is 
no pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is seen. Subtle haziness 
over the lateral right mid chest may be due to overlying soft 
tissue. No definite focal consolidation is seen. The cardiac and 
mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  
 EKG with NSR with no changes compared to prior  
 Patient was given:  
 SL Nitroglycerin SL .4 mg  
 SL Nitroglycerin SL .4 mg  
 SL Nitroglycerin SL .4 mg  
 IV Morphine Sulfate 5 mg  
 IV Ondansetron 4 mg  
 IV DRIP Nitroglycerin 0.5 mcg/kg/min increased to 5 mcg/kg/min  

 IV Heparin 3800 UNIT  
 IV Heparin Started 750  
 PO/NG Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg  
 PO/NG Diltiazem 30 mg  

 Cardiology Consulted with following recommendations:  
 Patent discussed. h/o CAD s/p Promus DES to mid-LAD, D1 branch, 
and distal-RCA on ___, s/p Premier DES to ___ on ___. 
LAD ___, presenting with c/o chest pain (per ED concerning 
for angina). Currently cardiac biomarkers are negative and EKG 
with no significant ST segment changes. Concern for UA to be 
initiated/continued on IV NTG, beta blockers, IV heparin, ASA, 
plavix and diltiazem.  

 - Start IV heparin  
 - Ct IV NTG  
 - Carvedilol and diltiazem  
 - ASA and Plavix  
 - Statin  
 - Obtain serial EKG and trend troponin  
 Vitals on transfer:  
 HR 108 BP 130/43 RR 20 SpO2 97% RA  

 On the floor the patient notes ongoing ___ pain in his left 
chest. He notes he started having chest pain this morning at 7 
AM after eating breakfast rated at ___. The pain was noted to 
be left sided with radiation to his left arm associated with 
shortness of breath and palpitations. He denies associated 
diaphoresis. He notes that he called an ambulance and was given 
4 doses of baby aspirin enroute to the hospital. He also tried 
taking his nitroglycerin at home with no relief of his chest 
pain. He notes nausea in the Emergency department that has not 
resolved. He denies any vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, 
fever, chills, or dysuria. He does endorse a chronic cough that 
he has had for a long time per his report. 
 
 ROS: On review of systems, denies recent fevers, chills or 
rigors. Denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other 
review of systems were negative. Cardiac review of systems is 
notable for absence of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal 
dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, syncope or presyncope.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___, 

Thank you for allowing us to take part in your care during your 
stay in the hospital. You came into the hospital with chest 
pain.  Your chest pain was treated with nitroglycerin and a 
blood thinner, but your blood tests did not show any damage to 
your heart. You had an exercise stress test to check the 
arteries in your heart which showed no concerning evidence of 
ongoing heart injury. You also had an acute kidney injury that 
arose likely because of starting a medication called lisinopril 
for your blood pressure. Your kidney injury has since improved. 

You should continue the medications as listed in the enclosed 
discharge paperwork. 

Please follow-up with your PCP and your cardiologist. Please 
weight yourself every day and call your MD if your weight goes 
up by 3 lbs. 

It was a pleasure taking care of you,

quadrants, unchanged from previous episodes of abdominal pain. 
Of note, patient has had numerous ED and outpatient visits for 
this pain without clear source. He also notes pain with 
urination the last ___ days associated with hematuria which is 
new for him. He reports that his urine is ""brick"" red without 
visible clots. He also reports a fever to ___ over the weekend 
and malaise which began around the same time as his urine 
darkening. He denies any changes to his bowel habits, diarrhea, 
hematochezia, melena, ___ colored stools. His last bowel

97% RA  
 Upon arrival to the floor, patient reports ___ lower quadrant 
abdominal pain unchanged in character or distribution from 
baseline. He is most concerned about his urinary changes. For me 
he denies, fever, chills, dysuria, frequency, urgency, foul odor 
to urine, diarrhea. He does endorse constipation with last bowel 
movement being ___ days prior. He decided to come to the 
hospital for evaluation of his urinary changes but also because 
he felt he was more weak than normal for him.

IMAGING
___ CXR
Persistent right lower lobe pneumonia.  

___ CXR 
Right lower lobe pneumonia and small right pleural effusion.

___ RUQ US
1.  The hepatic parenchyma appears coarsened.  No focal liver 
lesions.

___ Renal US
Normal renal ultrasound.  No hydronephrosis.

___ TTE
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The estimated 
cardiac index is high (>4.0L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging 
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure 
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good 
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 

 Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the degree of aortic regurgitation appears slightly less in the 
current study; moderate pulmonary hypertension is detected. The 
other findings are similar.

undetectable VL), HepC s/p Harvoni (reportedly with undetectable 
VL), CAD s/p multiple stents, CKD (baseline Cr 1.5), HTN, COPD 
and chronic diarrhea who presents with hematuria and abdominal 
pain, found to have c-diff, CAP pneumonia, non-oliguric ___ with 
nephrotic range proteinuria. 

#RLL PNEUMONIA: On admission, patient did not report SOB above 
baseline but had leukocytosis and CXR showing R pleural effusion 
with either compressive atelectasis or PNA in RLL so we treated 
as CAP.  As of ___, patient was having worsening SOB, malaise, 
and cough, in setting of demand ischemia, c-diff, and with poor 
improvement from previous azithromycin/ceftriaxone treatment for 
CAP. Abx escalated to vancomycin/zosyn(day 1 = ___, 
de-escalated on ___ to levofloxacin (last day ___. For 
symptomatic relief, given duonebs and guaifenesin. 

___ ON CKD: Cr on presentation is 3.0 from baseline of 1.5. 
Urine lytes are notable for elevated Prot/Cr ratio 5.0, UNa 15 
and UCl less than assay. FeNa<1%. Urine culture was negative. 
BUN/Cr have been stable ranging from 2.9-3.3 and w/ preserved 
urine output (~1400cc/day). Given his new ___, elevated 
Protein/Cr ratio with hematuria, renal was consulted for 
evaluation of possible nephrotic/nephritic syndrome which may be 
playing a role in his presentation. Renal consulted and felt ___ 
likely ___ ischemic ATN in the setting of hypovolemia from 
chronic diarrhea w/ poor PO intake. Other etiologies of renal 
insufficiency with nephrotic range proteinuria were considered 
(ie HIVAN, primary or secondary membranous nephropathy, 
amyloid). However, based on his presentation, clinical course, 
and urine sediment (no active component) ___ is most likely from 
ATN & proteinuria by hypertensive nephropathy. Notably, C3/C4 
wnl, & TP/Cr improving with better BP control. Cr on discharge = 
2.1.

#METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: in setting ___ and diarrhea. Started on 
bicarbonate TID per renal.

#ANEMIA: thought likely mixed picture, with both iron deficiency 
and anemia of chronic disease. Less concerning for hemolysis or 
acute bleed. Hgb 6.8 on admission from baseline of 8.2-8.5 and 
improving s/p 1pRBC ___. Guiac positive but recent normal EGD 
and colonoscopy. Given 1 U PRBC ___ for goal Hb>8 following 
demand ischemia (see below). 

#C Diff: Patient producing mucus jelly diarrhea and found to 
have positive c diff in stool. Patient started on oral 
vancomycin but due to persistent diarrhea, IV flagyl added on 
___. Diarrhea improved and IV flagyl discontinued on 
___. PO vancomycin continued w/ plan for ___ay 
1= ___, last day = ___. 

#Chest Pain, CAD: Hx 3 vessel dx w/ BMS. On ___, patient 
developed chest pressure with SOB, cough, and malaise. Troponin 
elevated at 1.16 but CKMB normal at 4, EKG w/ ST elevations in 
V2 and V3 w/o reciprocal changes. CXR unchanged or improved. 
Cardiology consulted and most concerned for missed MI vs mild 
demand ischemia in the setting of his known CAD and slow GI 
bleed.  TTE obtained w/ no focal wall motion abnormalities and 
preserved EF, making missed MI less likely.  Patient had no 
further episodes of chest pain. Transfusion goal made for Hb>8. 
He continued aspirin 81, carvedilol 25 mg bid, dilt 120, hydral 
75 qid and imdur 90 for CAD. 

#Altered Mental Status: On ___, Patient appeared altered, angry 
and confused unlike his baseline. Refusing morning labs. Most 
likely toxic metabolic encephalapathy in setting of c-diff and 
pneumonia. 

#Transaminitis: LFTs mildly elevated above normal baseline. 
Patient does have history of HCV/HIV s/p treatment with last 
reported viral loads undetectable. RUQ echo shows cirrhosis of 
liver with no new nodules. Likely hypovolemia and hypoperfusion 
in the setting of chronic cirrhosis. -___ labs, undetectable 
HIV viral loads, undetectable HCV viral loads unlikely 
medication side effect, portal 

#Dark urine: Patient reports reddish discoloration but resolving 
to yellow and clear. UA showed proteinuria, bilirubin, and few 
RBCs but moderate amount of blood raising the question of 
myoglobinuria. No recent trauma or instrumentation to the 
bladder that would explain this finding. Other possibilities 
include primary renal parenchymal disease or 
prerenal/dehydration in the setting of hypovolemia. Most 
concerning is a recovering rhabdomyalysis with possible 
myoglobin in urine with elevated CK. Acute intermittent 
porphyria is possible given the hematuria, and chronic 
intermittent abdominal pain. Given Prot/Cre ratio, nephrotic 
syndromes associated with HIV such as immune complex mediated 
glomerulonephritis, membranous nephropathy, or HIV associated 
nephropathy are possibly. Hemolytic anemia is unlikely given 
high direct bilirubin. Urine was bland and renal ultrasound 
showed no hydronephrosis.  

#ABDOMINAL PAIN: chronic per patient. Although patient does have 
a history of elevated lipase which could suggest chronic 
inflammation.  

CHRONIC ISSUES
#CAD: treatment as above
#HIV/HEP C COINFECTION/ CIRRHOSIS: c/b by known portal 
hypertension. Last EGD on ___ showed no esophageal varices.  
Patient continued HAART meds.
#COPD: currently without acute exacerbation. Patient denies 
increased sputum production despite read of PNA on CXR. 
#HTN: BP moderately well controlled. Will continue home Imdur, 
Hydralazine, carvedilol, amlodipine.  
#HLD: will hold home pravastatin given LFT abnormalities  
#GERD: continue home omeprazole  

Transitional Issues
- new medications:  oral vancomycin for Cdiff, end date = 
___. Sodium bicarbonate. 
- discontinued medications: oxybutynin to prevent urinary 
retention, pravastatin given possible resolving rhabdomyolysis, 
loperamide given Cdiff infection
- Follow up chest radiograph 6 weeks after completion of 
treatment is recommended to ensure resolution. 
- Consider exchanging amlodipine given patient complaint of LLE
- Changed LaMIVudine to 50mg during hospitalization when Cr 3.0. 
D/c with dose at 100mg with Cr 2.1. Follow up for appropriate 
dosing when Cr stable at baseline of home dose 150mg.

IMAGING
RUQUS ___. Coarsened hepatic echotexture without focal liver lesion. 
2. Patent portal vein with normal hepatopetal flow. 
3. No biliary ductal dilatation. 

CT A/P ___
IMPRESSION:  
 1. Consolidation in the right lower lobe is similar to that 
seen on the prior chest radiograph from ___, compatible 
with pneumonia.  
 2. Liquid stool within the colon and rectum is consistent with 
the history of diarrhea. No acute intra-abdominal abnormality 
otherwise seen. 
 
 ___ CXR: IMPRESSION: Patchy right lower lobe opacity, not 
substantially changed in the interval, likely reflective of 
continued pneumonia. Trace right pleural effusion, perhaps 
minimally increased.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr ___ is a ___ year old man with past medical 
history significant for HIV on HAART (reportedly with 
undetectable VL), HCV s/p Harvoni (reportedly with undetectable 
VL), CAD s/p multiple stents, CKD (reported baseline Cr 1.5), 
HTN, COPD and chronic diarrhea who presented with abdominal pain 
and distention. No acute process was seen on CT A/P. CXR and a 
portion of CT again noted Right lower lung opacity, for which he 
was put on a 7 day course of levofloxacin. He had a slight 
troponinemia stable at 0.01-0.02 without evidence of ischemia. 
EKG without significant changes from prior. 

# Abdominal Pain/Distention: Pt's abdominal pain seems 
consistent with prior episodes. Diarrhea has resolved and he has 
completed course of PO vancomycin making C.Diff unlikely. CT A/P 
without acute process. RUQUS unchanged from prior. Patient does 
have history of HCV/HIV s/p treatment with last reported viral 
loads undetectable. Patient's pain resolved with Zofran and 
remained tolerable. 

 # Troponinemia: Patient presented with abdominal pain. EKG 
unchanged from prior and no classic symptoms (patient said 
previous angina pain was true chest discomfort). Trop was 
elevated on admission 0.01 (NOT <0.01) and then trended up to 
0.02. Despite history, very unlikely acute plaque rupture. 
Received 324 ASA in ED after second trop. In review of patients 
records, patient seems to have fluctuating low level trops at 
baseline, likely related to CKD. MBs remained flat and patient 
was maintained on ASA81. 

 # RLL Pneumonia: Unclear duration of onset. Patient does not 
report SOB above baseline and is currently satting well on room 
air. CT consolidation on CT is similar to prior. Patient dry 
cough, no fever, chills, or leukocytosis. Physical exam with R 
base rales. He initially received dose of HCAP coverage 
(vanc/zosyn) and was transitioned to 7 days of levofloxacin CAP 
coverage . His home nebulizers were continued. 

 CHRONIC ISSUES 
 # Anemia: Appears to be much higher than previous admission 
level, stable since last discharge. 

 # ___ vs CKD: Creatinine on presentation is 1.8 (reported 
baseline is 1.5, but no recent values are close to that level.) 
Unclear if patient reverted to new baseline, 

 # CAD: s/p DES to mid-LAD, D1, and distal RCA ___, s/p DES 
to ___ ___. 
 - Continued home carvedilol, statin continued to be held. 
 # HIV/HCV Co-infection/ Cirrhosis: c/b by known portal 
hypertension. Last EGD on ___ showed no esophageal varices. 
 - continued ART meds 
 # COPD: Currently without acute exacerbation. Patient denies 
increased sputum production. 
 - Home nebulizers 
 # HTN: BP moderately well controlled. 
 - Continued home isosorbide, hydralazine, carvedilol, 
amlodipine. 
 # HLD: Pravstatin continued to be held; recommend re-evaluating 

 # GERD: continued home omeprazole 

TRANSITIONAL
- Pneumonia: Patient started on levofloxacin for 7 day course. 
Given renal function he will receive 1 dose on ___, 1 dose on 
___, and 1 dose on ___.
- CAD: Patient's pravastatin was discontinued at last discharge. 
Consider restarting this as LFTs have normalized. 
- ART: Lamivudine at 100mg given renal function. Continue to 
monitor Creatinine to resume 150mg dosing.

CARDIAC STUDIES:
========================
Persantine stress test (___):
INTERPRETATION: This ___ year old man with h/o CKD, HIV, HTN, 
COPD, 
and HFpEF; s/p multiple PCIs was referred to the lab for 
evaluation of chest pain. The patient was administered 0.142 
mg/kg/min of Persantine over four minutes. During infusion, the 
patient noted ___ abdominal discomfort with ___ substernal 
chest discomfort, improving with inspiration noted post 
infusion. These discomforts resolved slowly after administration 
of 4L of O2 and 125 mg of Aminophylline IV. In the presence of 
baseline NSSTTW, an additional 1 mm of downsloping ST segment 
depression was noted in the inferolateral leads, returning to 
baseline slowly by minute 24 post infusion. The rhythm was sinus 
with rare, isolated APBs and one VPB throughout the study. 
Baseline systolic hypertension with an appropriate hemodynamic 
response to the infusion. 
IMPRESSION: Ischemic EKG changes in the presence of probable 
anginal 
type symptoms. Baseline systolic hypertension. Nuclear report 
sent 
separately. 

Cardiac perfusion studies (___):
The image quality is adequate but limited due to soft tissue and 
left arm attenuation.  
Left ventricular cavity size is normal. 
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal a partially reversible, 
moderate reduction in photon counts involving the entire 
anterior wall, the mid anteroseptum and the apex.  There is also 
a partially reversible, mild reduction in photon counts 
involving the mid and basal anterolateral and inferolateral 
walls.  These findings are uncertain in the setting of left arm 
attenuation. 
Gated images reveal normal wall motion.  
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 56% with an 
EDV of 101 ml. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Probable partially reversible, large, moderate severity 
perfusion defect involving the LAD territory. 
2. Probable partially reversible, medium sized, mild perfusion 
defect involving the LCx territory. 
3. Normal left ventricular cavity size and systolic function.   
Compared with prior study of ___, the perfusion defects 
are new (prior study did not have left arm attenuation). 

ECG (___): NSR HR 76, PR 158 ms RR 782 ms QRS 88 ms, QTc 420 
ms, q wave in aVL, no clear ischemic changes, and no change from 
prior.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ gentleman with CAD s/p multiple 
stents, HIV (on ART reportedly with undetectable VL), HCV s/p 
Harvoni (reportedly with undetectable VL) , CKD (baseline Cr 
1.9), HTN, and COPD who presented for evaluation of substernal, 
non-radiating, nonpositional, and noninspiratory ___ chest 
pain. 

#CAD: Pt is s/p Promus DES to mid-LAD, D1 branch, and distal-RCA 
on ___, s/p Premier DES to mLCX on ___, and BMS to LAD 
___. He had a Stress MIBI in ___ showing normal 
perfusion and no wall motion abnormalities.  

#Chest pain: Pt presented on ___ with substernal, non-radiating, 
nonpositional, noninspiratory, and nonreproducible ___ chest 
pain at rest. ECG on admission was notable for with <1 mm STE in 
lateral leads, consistent with prior and Troponin x2 were 
negative. His ___ chest pain decreased to ___ with SLN x2 in 
EMS, IV morphine in the ED, and x2 upon arrival to the floor.  
His clinical picture was c/f ACS, perhaps unstable angina given 
his hx, although cardiac enzymes were not elevated and there 
were no ECG findings. He was maintained on telemetry and ECGs 
were trended, w/o evidence of additional ischemic disease 
throughout his hospitalization. A ddx of PNA was also considered 
initially given the patient's admissions x2 (___) for RLL PNA 
and CXR on admission notable for RLL atelectasis, although 
patient had no fever, productive cough, worsening SOB, or 
leukocytosis to suggest this. Also considered that patient's 
chest pain was ___ to GERD/gas pains given his hx of GERD, 
belching and bloating on exam, and partial relief with 
simethicone upon arrival to the floor. PE was considered, but 
deemed unlikely given patient's pain was not pleuritic, he had 
no tachycardia/tachypnea, and he had normal O2sats. 
Musculoskeletal causes of his chest pain were also less likely 
given that his pain was not well localized or positional, and 
and there was no tenderness to palpation on exam. Pericarditis 
was unlikely given that pain did not increased with inspiration 
and did not improve w/sitting forward. On ___ AM, pt denied 
chest pain, said that his SOB and dry cough were at b/l as 
related to his COPD, although he continued to be nauseous and 
complained of abdominal discomfort and bloating as detailed 
below (see #Chronic abdominal pain). On ___, patient had 
pharmacologic nuclear stress test notable for ischemic changes: 
1 mm of downsloping ST segment depression was noted in the 
inferolateral leads and new, partially reversible, perfusion 
defects were noted in the LAD and LCx territory, c/f possible 
restenosis of prior proximal or distal LAD stents per report. 
Based on discussion between the patient's outpatient 
cardiologist (Dr. ___, inpatient consulting cardiology 
team, and primary team, it was considered that the nuclear 
defect noted on the stress test could be an artifact as 
patient's left arm was in the way during the imaging, and it was 
decided not to pursue inpatient catheterization, but to pursue 
an outpatient dobutamine echocardiogram. The decision was made 
at the point to optimize the patient medically from the 
standpoint of his known ischemic disease, and specifically focus 
on managing his hypertension, as discussed below (see 
#Hypertension). On ___, the patient had  additional abdominal 
pain, with repeat ECG unchanged from prior, and with troponin x2 
<0.01. Throughout his hospitalization, patient was maintained on 
his home ASA, carvedilol, diltiazem, and pravastatin as 
described below. His hydralazine regimen and isosorbide 
mononitrate ER regimen were changed as described below (see 
#Hypertension). Of note, the patient was intermittently 
emotional during his hospitalization in the context of 
confronting his multiple medical comorbidities. Social work and 
spiritual care were consulted, and provided resources to the 
patient to help with his coping. 

#HTN: Patient's recent outpatient BPs per OMR have been 
120s-170s/50s-70s. BP 180/71 on arrival to floor on ___, likely 
at least partially due to patient having missed BP doses at home 
iso chest pain. He received home isosorbide, hydralazine, 
carvedilol, amlodipine, and diltiazem at 12AM on night of 
admission, but had BP 210/80 overnight. He was asx w/o HA, CP, 
palpitations, or visual difficulty at that time. He received 
hydrazine 10 mg IV, w/repeat BP 180/70. BP 163/70 on ___. On 
___ AM, patient again had BP 211/73, but hydralazine 10 mg IV 
was deferred, as pt was set to receive his AM BP meds. BP on 
recheck after receiving home BP meds was 155/68 on ___. As 
described above (under #CAD/Chest pain), plan was made to 
optimize patient's BP management iso of his known ischemic 
disease. On ___, patient's home isosorbide dinitrate was 
increased from 30 mg to 40 mg TID and patient was also started 
on lisinopril 5 mg QD on ___ as detailed below (under ___ on 
CKD). After this change, ___ BPs ranged from 124-211/60-101, 
with max SBP still in the 190s, which was a slight improvement. 
On ___, BPs ranged from 125-178/47-80. On ___ AM, administered 
isosorbide dinitrate 40 mg plus isosorbide mononitrate ER 120 mg 
PO (total 160 mg on ___, with resulting BPs on ___ ranging 
from 120-180s/50s-80s. Given continued poor control and 
hesitation about escalating isosorbide total daily dose above 
120 mg, opted to modify regimen to isosorbide mononitrate ER 120 
mg PO QD on ___. Also changed his hydralazine from 75 mg PO q6hr 
to 100 mg PO q8hr, largely for ease of medication administration 
at home. At time of discharge, patient had BPs ranging from 
140-184/64-75. Of note, given patient's refractory hypertension 
in spite of being on multiple agents, considered that he may 
have secondary hypertension. Obtained renal U/S w/Doppler which 
showed no e/o renal artery stenosis and no e/o ischemic kidney 
damage. ___ consider additional workup for secondary causes of 
hypertension in outpatient setting. 

#Abdominal pain: Pt complained of nausea and abdominal ""bloating 
and discomfort all over"" on admission, but endorsed RUQ as site 
of most pain. He said that he had not had a BM since ___ hrs PTA 
and that normally he has BM x1 daily. His admission exam was 
notable for hyperactive BS throughout, significant abdominal 
distension, and slight ttp in the RUQ. It is likely that pt was 
experiencing discomfort ___ to gas in light of relief with 
simethicone. Considered biliary pathology/pancreatitis, but LFTs 
and lipase wnl on ___. It is most likely that patient was 
constipated, given that KUB on ___ was notable for mild gaseous 
distension of several loops of bowel c/w with gas and 
constipation. Colonoscopy ___ normal w/o polyps. Patient was 
continued on his home omeprazole, docusate, and senna, as well 
as simethicone. On ___, pt still had abdominal discomfort and 
bloating, but no tenderness to palpation, although he did pass 
""slight gas"" on ___ and then had large BM on ___ ___ after 
starting polyethylene glycol. On ___ AM, abdomen was much softer 
on exam, although still somewhat distended, and this remained 
unchanged on ___. Per patient, this level of distension was his 
baseline. Patient had some additional abdominal pain on ___ AM, 
which improved with Maalox-diphenhydramine-lidocaine x2. Given 
c/f for possibility that abdominal pain was masking cardiac 
pain, EKG was performed, which was unchanged from prior, and 
troponins were cycled and were negative x2. Patient's abdominal 
pain was also contributing to a reduced appetite, and he diet 
was also supplemented with Ensure clears, starting on ___. Even 
though patient denies worsening abdominal pain w/eating, there 
was some c/f mesenteric ischemia given his significant CAD. 
Lactate level was obtained at 0.7, which was reassuring. In 
addition, patient endorsed that he has had chronic abdominal 
pain for several years w/frequent constipation/diarrhea, 
bloating, and flatulence. Formally possible that he has 
irritable bowel syndrome, and may benefit from GI evaluation as 
an outpatient.  

#CKD: Patient has baseline Cr 1.9 per OMR notes. Cr on admission 
2.1 on ___. This elevation was initially thought to be of a 
pre-renal etiology ___ to hypovolemia. However, the patient 
received multiple IVF boluses from ___ (total 3L) w/Cr still 
___ on ___. His Chem10 on ___ was also notable for HCO3 13, AG 
19, c/f non-anion gap metabolic acidosis (see #non-anion gap 
metabolic acidosis). Renal was consulted regarding the etiology 
of the patient's kidney dysfunction. The patient endorsed to the 
renal team that he has had proteinuria (frothy urine) for many 
years raising c/f glomerular disease, such as FSGS or membranous 
nephropathy. HIVAN was deemed unlikely given well-controlled HIV 
viral load (undetectable on this admission). Per renal, there 
was no indication for biopsy. The patient was started on 
lisinopril 5 mg QD on ___. He was also continued on his home 
bicarbonate 1300 mg PO TID. His medications were renal dosed and 
nephrotoxic agents were avoided. Cr 2.1 remained throughout 
remainder of hospitalization w/exception of bump to 2.8 on ___ 
AM, which was likely prerenal ___ hypovolemia, as Cr resolved 
back to 2.1 on ___ after patient received 1L LR. At time of 
discharge on ___, Cr 2.1. Patient's chem10 should be rechecked 
on ___, two weeks after initiation of lisinopril 5 mg QD. 

#Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: Patient's HCO3 13 on ___ with 
AG 19. Patient had been having loose stools PTA, which may have 
been contributing. Also received 3L of NS on ___ as described 
above under #CKD. Prior OMR notes suggest that patient may have 
RTA. Renal was consulted as above. Pt had urine pH 6.5 on ___ 
and one would have expected lower urine pH iso HCO3 13, and so 
picture was c/f RTA 1 (distal) and RTA2 (proximal tubule). Of 
note, patient lacked glucosuria, phosphaturia/low serum 
phosphorous, or low vit D that would be c/w RTA2. On ___, urine 
studies were notable for UreaN:474, Creat:85, Na:72, K:47, 
Cl:57, UOsm:417, HCO3 14 and VBG notable for pH 7.37, pCO2 25, 
pO2 225, HCO3 15. With correction, pH 7.41, pCO2 21, serum HCO3, 
likely indicating a mixed picture, specifically NAGMA with 
additional respiratory alkalosis (although patients respiratory 
rates were not elevated). UA pH 6.5. UAG = 62. HCO3 17 on ___, 
c/w distal RTA.  Patient's home bicarbonate 2300 mg PO TID was 
continued as above. 

#Hyponatremia. Patient has hx of SIADH per note in OMR in ___, 
where he had persistent hyponatremia, with urinary Na 
persistently <20 and UOsm in the 300s, and TSH and AM cortisol 
wnl. At that time, IVF challenge x2 was w/o improvement in Na. 
On this admission, Na 125 on presentation, w/ hypotonic 
hyponatremia given SOsm 272, with UNa 21 and UOsm 416 c/w mixed 
picture of hypovolemic hyponatremia and SIADH. Patient was 
initiated on 2L PO fluid restriction given c/f SIADH. Previously 
normal Na 134 in ___. The patient had no JVD or peripheral 
edema, and does not appear volume overloaded on exam. He was 
A&Ox3 w/o MS changes throughout hospitalization. He received 
500cc NS on admission as above, w/repeat Na 125 (no change) on 
___ AM, c/w with SIADH. He then received 1L NS bolus over 1 hr 
on ___, with Chem10 post-bolus notable for Na 126, suggesting 
slight improvement with fluids, and definite component of 
hypovolemia. On ___ Na ___ s/p mIVF @125cc/hr, more c/w 
hypovolemic hyponatremia rather than SIADH and 2L PO fluid 
restriction was discontinued. Since ___, pt's Na ranged from 
133-135. 

#Atelectasis. Patient was recently admitted in ___ and 
___ with RLL pneumonia. On the first admission, he 
was treated initially with azithromycin/ceftriaxone, 
transitioned first to Vanc/Zosyn, and then transitioned to 
levofloxacin that was completed on ___ prior to discharge. 
On second admission, he was treated with vanc/zosyn, and 
transitioned to levofloxacin- completed on ___. Patient reported 
shortness of breath and nonproductive cough that are chronic for 
him during admission. He was afebrile and w/o leukocytosis 
throughout hospitalization. CXR on admission ___ was notable for 
possible RLL opacification suggestive of either resolving 
infection vs atelectasis. Although the patient had no no clear 
PNA sx, his reported chest pain could have been ___ to R lung 
infection, although this was unlikely.  Patient was encouraged 
to use incentive spirometry throughout hospitalization. Also 
continued his home Spiriva and albuterol inhaler as below. 

#Thrombocytopenia: Patient with plt ranging from ___ 100s 
throughout admission. He has had chronic interrmiten 
thrombocytopenia with plt ___ per OMR notes for last few 
years. Of note, he did have an increase into low 200s during 
admission in ___ for PNA, but this was likely reactive 
thrombocytosis iso infection. Possible etiology of his 
thrombocytopenia includes HCV cirrhosis, although albumin 3.6 
and INR 1.1 on ___, suggestive of preserved liver synthetic 
function. Also possible that his thrombocytopenia is related to 
chronic tx with Abacavir and Lamivudine. Also could consider 
ITP.

#Anemia: Patient has chronic anemia with b/l H&H ___. H/H 
7.___.1 on admission on ___. H&H 7.8/___.6 on ___ and ___. 
Received 1 unit pRBC on ___ (given known ischemic disease as 
described above), with repeat H&H 8.5/26.2 on ___. Considered 
initially that there may also be a dilutional component given 
plt also down from 98 on admission to 82 on ___ iso having 
received 3L IVF on ___, but no IVF since then, and plt still 81 
on ___, w/ H&H ranging between 8.1-8.___.1-27.3 (i.e, close to 
baseline) throughout remainder of admission. 

#HIV/HCV co infection w/cirrhosis. Per OMR notes, patient's 
disease is complicated by known portal HTN. Last EGD on ___ 
showed no esophageal varices and last RUQUS ___ for ___ 
screening was notable for cirrhosis w/o lesions suggestive HCC. 
HIV viral load was undetectable during admission. Patient was 
continued on his home Abacavir, Efavirenz, and Lamivudine.   
  
#COPD: Patient was admitted with chronic SOB and dry cough. 
There were no wheezes on exam, and minimal c/f acute COPD 
exacerbation.  Patient was continued on his home albuterol 
inhaler and Spiriva and encouraged to use incentive spirometry. 

#HLD: Patient was continued on his home Pravastatin.

#GERD: Patient was continued on his home omeprazole.   

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================== 
#Patient, who was started on lisinopril 5 mg QD on ___ for 
renal protective effects and adjunct for BP control, should have 
repeat chem10 on ___. 
#Patient has history of refractory hypertension, and during 
admission had BPs spiking to 180s-210s several times. Patient 
had inpatient renal U/S w/Doppler w/o evidence of renal artery

History of Present Illness:
___ HIV on ART, HCV on harvoni, HTN, anemia, COPD, CAD s/p 
multiple stents and bilateral PAD presents with 5 days of 
constant lower left leg pain and swelling at rest.  
 Patient has prior history of LLE angiography done by cardiology 
in ___, but NO history of peripheral vascular stent placement 
or bypass surgery, at least at this facility. Angiography at 
that time showed diffuse plaque throughout the LLE arterial 
tree. Of note, patient insists that he has had peripheral stents 
placed at ___ in the past, but extensive review of the records 
shows that patient only had LLE angiography ___ and was 
supposed to see vascular surgery for discussion of possible 
bypass surgery, but was lost to follow up.  
 Patient recently discharged on ___ for an admission of 
chest pain (which was managed medically) with a hospital course 
significant for poorly controlled hypertension. Since his 
discharge, the patient has had lower extremity ___ leg pain at 
rest, not worse with walking, not improved with positional. He 
also endorses numbness and tingling from the bilateral ankle and 
extending to the plantar surface. He denies buttocks, hip or 
thigh pain. No recent travel. No waking up at night from pain. 
Patient has no history of surgeries in the legs. His last 
peripheral cath in ___ significant for severe bilateral tibial 
disease. Patient is able to ambulate normally, but is limited in 
ambulation by shortness of breath. No ulcers. He otherwise 
denies CP, palpitations, n/v/d/c. Endorses chronic abdominal 
pain and chronic difficulty breathing (COPD), but no change in 
either of these symptoms.  
Over the past 1 week, symptoms have become progressively worse. 
Symptoms at rest and with exertion. No precipitating, 
alleviating, or exacerbating factors. Now also having mild pain 
in L foot, cannot characterize further. This AM while seated in 
a chair, noted severe numbness and associated mild pain of L 
foot, so called his cardiologist's office. It was recommended 
that he come to ED for further evaluation.

****TRANSITIONAL ISSUES****
#CODE: Full (confirmed) 
#CONTACT: ___ (HCP) Relationship: niece 
___
#Infectious stool studies negative including O + P, c diff 
toxin, giardia, cryptosporidium 
#Last ___ screening ultrasound was ___. 
#Aggressive bowel regimen started for constipation. 
#Please check repeat Chem 10 in ___ days following discharge to 
ensure improvement in sodium 

Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with a complex medical 
history including coronary artery disease s/p stenting, Hep C 
cirrhosis now with SVR, chronic well controlled HIV, and chronic 
kidney disease who presented with acute on chronic abdominal 
pain found to have asymptomatic hyponatremia. 

#Abdominal pain: CT scan of the abdomen was unremarkable except 
for a significant stool burden.  We treated him with an 
agressive bowel regimen which took a couple days to induce a 
bowel movement. He required lactulose, which worked with good 
effect.  This was given to him at discharge  as a prn medication 
in addition to a scheduled bowel regimen consisting of Miralax, 
senna, and colace.  His exam was notable for a distended but 
benign abdomen that became softer as he started having bowel 
movements. 

#Hyponatremia: Likely related to decreased PO intake in the 
setting of abdominal discomfort. FeUrea sugested pre-renal 
state, consistent with a urine Osm of 262, Na 26 (on diuretic), 
Cl < 20.  He did not have any neurological symptoms suggesting 
acute hyponatremia and his sodium slow rose during the 
hospitalization.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ w/ PMH of CAD s/p Promus DES to mid-LAD, D1 branch, and 
distal-RCA on ___ (also other stents: total 7), HIV on 
HAART, CKD (baseline Cr 2.4-2.5), diastolic CHF, PAD, HCV with 
well compensated cirrhosis s/p harvoni, G6PD deficiency, who 
presented with chest pain worrisome for unstable angina. 

# Unstable Angina: # CAD:
Patient notably has had several repeat presentations with 
similar type of anginal chest pain, when medical workups 
demonstrated some probable new atherosclerotic disease causing 
partially reversible perfusion defects involving the LAD and LCx 
territory. Due to patient's advanced CKD and the risks involved 
with catheterization with angiography, decision had been made in 
the past to treat subsequent events of anginal pain medically 
without surgical or operative intervention if possible.

Patient presented with chest pain that radiated to his left 
shoulder, of approximately 1 day's duration, nonpleuritic or 
positional in nature. Sublingual nitroglycerine provided minimal 
improvement. Patient took 4x81 mg aspirin and presented for 
evaluation in the ED. Laboratory studies were notable for 
troponin of 0.02 in the setting of CKD with a Cr of 2.3 
(baseline), with ongoing stable anemia with Hb of 8.5. Patient 
was admitted for observation regarding his anginal pain. His 
cardiac markers did not elevate further. His isosorbide dosage 
was increased to 120 mg bid. He was discharged with instruction 
to follow-up with his primary care doctor and cardiologist.

# Hypertensive Urgency: 
Patient's observation course was notable for hypertensive 
urgency (first to systolic blood pressures of 210) in the 
setting of his ongoing intermittent anginal pain. His isosorbide 
was increased as above. Resuming his previous discontinued 
torsemide was considered, though he achieved improvement of his 
blood pressures on isosorbide alone. Diltiazem, hydralazine, and 
amlodipine were also continued. At time of discharge his blood 
pressures had improved and he was ambulating well with a walker. 


*Chronic Issues:
# History of Diastolic CHF:  Patient had a history of chronic 
CHF. There was no evidence of exacerbation during this 
admission. Patient had recently stopped his home torsemide in 
outpatient setting in late ___ due to elevated Cr. This was 
not resumed, as above.
# CKD: patient had a baseline of Cr 2.4-2.5 recently.  At 
baseline.  Seemed to improve after stopping Torsemide (was 3.1 
prior). Torsemide not resumed. 
# COPD: continued Albuterol Inhaler 2 PUFF IH Q6H:PRN wheeze  
# HIV:  Continued home Maivudine, Abacavir, Efavirenz
# GERD: continued pantoprazole, discontinued omeprazole given 
redundancy
# Constipation: continued senna/Colace.
# Nutrition: continued vitamin B12

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- patient's isosorbide dosage was increased to 120 mg bid given 
his ongoing hypertensive urgency in the setting of intermittent 
anginal pain. Review of his records had indicated a steady 
pattern of hypertension at outpatient visits, and it appeared 
other elements of his regimen were already at max dosage.
- Patient was not resumed on his prior torsemide (d/c'd in 
___. Should he have refractory hypertension not responsive 
to the above, torsemide may be a good option to resume in the 
setting of his chronic kidney disease (if his Cr can tolerate a 
low dosage).
- Discussion took place with pharmacy regarding his statin 
dosage. Patient may benefit from uptitration of his pravastatin 
dosage to 40 mg daily, which is compatible with his current 
HAART regimen.
- Patient has blood cultures from admission that require 
follow-up

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital because you had symptoms of 
chest pain that seemed related to your prior history of coronary 
artery disease. You were evaluated in the emergency room with 
blood work, electrocardiography, and imaging, which demonstrated 
minimal evidence of another heart attack. It did seem that your 
pain was related to ongoing symptoms of your coronary artery 
disease, however. Past studies have indicated that you have some 
areas of the heart that do not receive as much blood flow, and 
this may be contributing to some of your occasional symptoms. It 
did not seem that any acute heart attack was happening, so we 
decided not to recommend another attempt at catheterization or 
thinning your blood.

Your blood pressures were markedly elevated on admission to the 
hospital, however, which we think could be related to the pain 
you are experiencing when you have angina. It can be dangerous 
for you to have sustained high blood pressures, especially given 
your heart disease, so we have increased the amount of 
isosorbide you take to 120 mg twice a day. 

Your blood pressures were better controlled at the end of the 
day and you were feeling better, so it was safe for you to leave 
the hospital. Please follow-up with your primary care and 
cardiology doctors and take ___ your medications as prescribed.

It was a pleasure to be involved with your medical care!

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ with CKD, CAD, HIV, HCV, cirrhosis, HTN, 
who presented with melena and acute blood loss anemia.

# Acute GI bleed
# Acute blood loss anemia
# Upper GI AVM s/p EGD: After initial resuscitation with 1U PRBC 
he underwent EGD and was found to have bleeding AVM, initially 
felt high risk for continued bleeding. He was started on 
Protonix BID and Carafate QID, and observed over the weekend, 
subsequently taken back for repeat EGD today which proved 
reassuring. H/H was right at threshold, though stable, and with 
CAD/PAD he was transfused 1 more unit (along with Lasix 20mg IV) 
prior to discharge home.
- Protonix BID for 1 month, then resume home PPI
- Carafate QID for 1 week
- Outpatient CBC monitoring
- PCP, ___, and Nephrology appointments arranged by time 
of discharge

# Hypomagnesemia, with CKD stage III: Improved s/p repletion, 
subsequently stable.
- Outpatient Nephrology followup, scheduled prior to discharge

# Hypertension, poorly controlled: Stable. BPs rose while 
medications were held out of initial bleeding concern, but came 
under better control as medications were resumed. Continued home 
antihypertensive regimen.

# Cirrhosis due to
# HCV, s/p treatment: Some mild LFT elevation initially by 
report but LFTs normalized and remained normal over several 
days. Hepatology followed as the GI consult service while 
inpatient. Continued home medications.
- Outpatient hepatology followup - scheduled prior to discharge

# Chronic diastolic CHF: Stable with mild ___ edema. Continued 
home Torsemide after initial stabilization.

# CAD: Stable. Plavix discontinued with plan to not resume. Low 
dose ASA resumed at discharge. Other secondary prevention home 
medications resumed.

# HIV: Stable. Continued home medications.

Billing: >30 minutes spent coordinating discharge home

changes   

CT Abdomen and Pelvis ___: Impression: No evidence of acute 
abdominopelvic process to explain patient's symptoms.

Plain radiograph ___: Impression: Nonspecific, nonobstructive 
bowel pattern.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with hx of CAD (s/p DES to the mid LAD and distal RCA) 
stenting, hepatitis C (s/p harvoni), HIV infection (on HAART), 
cirrhosis, Stage 4 CKD, HTN, HFpEF, aortic regurgitation, COPD, 
G6PD deficiency and remote history of pulmonary TB and RPR, IBS 
and GI bleed who presented with abdominal pain and distention.

#UTI: On admission the patient was found to have a positive UA, 
with symptoms of abdominal pain and also described a few days of 
cloudy, odorous urine with mild pain with urination. He was 
treated for presumptive UTI with a plan to discharge on 
cefpidoxime PO for 4 more days along with outpatient ___, 
in order to narrow PO as indicated based on culture.

#IBS/abdominal pain: Regarding the patient's abdominal pain 
without n/v, it was acute over the past 4 days, and felt similar 
to past IBS flares per patient but was not relieved after 
linzess and bowel movement as expected. Reassuringly the CT A/P 
was negative for an acute process in the ED. There was mild 
lipase elevation without typical symptoms to suggest 
pancreatitis. It is possible this pain was referred pain from 
cystitis. A cardiac mimic was on the differential, but was less 
likely in the absence of acute ischemic EKG changes, trp 
elevation above baseline. Overall, most likely IBS related, with 
complete resolution of symptoms upon admission to the floor. The 
patient continued linzess from home, received IVF, bowel 
regimen, and anti-emetics/pain meds PRN.  

#CKD IV-V: Regarding the patients CKD Stage ___ HTN. baseline 
Cr ___. Cr 3.4 on admission at baseline. We renally dosed his 
medications and rescheduled his missed outpatient nephrology 
appnt for ___. For the patients chronic anemia, he missed 
an appointment for Aranesp injection, so BI Nephrology will 
contact pt to reschedule Aranesp injection.

 # Trp leak. Trp 0.07 on admission in the setting of CKD near 
baseline. EKG with old ischemic changes, no new reassuring. 
Tropinin x2 reassuring. He will continue with his regular 
outpatient cardiology follow up. His last outpatient cardiology 
appointment was in ___ with Dr. ___.

Transitional Issues:
[] Pt will complete 7d of antibiotics total for complicated 
urinary tract infection
[] Pt missed an appointment with his nephrologist due to being 
inpatient, and we have rescheduled this for him

         The C. difficile PCR is highly sensitive for toxigenic 
strains of
         C. difficile and detects both C. difficile infection 
(CDI) and

Brief Hospital Course:
====================
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
====================
Mr. ___ is a ___ with a history of CAD status post multiple 
stents, HFpEF, HCV cirrhosis, HIV, CKD, COPD, HTN, and anemia of 
chronic disease, who presented with 24 hours of nasal 
congestion, cough and generalized aches; found to have influenza 
A. 

====================
ACUTE/ACTIVE ISSUES:
====================
# Influenza A
# COPD
Presented with 24 hours of nasal congestion, non-productive 
cough, and generalized aches, subsequently found to have 
positive influenza A PCR. CXR without any evidence of 
superimposed PNA. Admitted given high risk comorbidities 
including COPD and immunosuppression (HIV, HCV). Completed a 5d 
course of Oseltamivir 30mg daily (renally dosed, ___. 
Otherwise continued his home Combivent inhaler q6 hrs PRN and 
started a PRN Albuterol nebulizer. Overall the patient felt 
significantly improved at discharge. He is to follow up with his 
PCP ___ 1 week for follow up.

# Diarrhea
# C. Difficile
Of note, most recent CD4 in the 400s. However, patient noted to 
have several day history of non-bloody diarrhea. Stool studies 
negative for Norovirus, Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, 
Crypto/Giardia, O&P, and CMV. Viral culture NGTD and Cyclospora 
PND, which PCP is to follow up on. Ultimately, C. Diff Ag 
returned positive (however toxin negative) indicating likely 
colonization - however given immunosuppressed state we opted to 
treat with a 14d course of PO Vancomycin 125mg QID (___). 
Of note, had significant associated abdominal distention and 
moderate pain, however KUB was reassuring overall (showed lots 
of gas). As such, was also started on Simethicone which improved 
his symptoms. His diarrhea was improving at discharge. 

# ___ on CKD, resolved: Baseline creatinine 3.5-3.8, with a peak 
Cr of 4.4 during his hospitalization that was most consistent 
with a pre-renal etiology based on FEUrea, urine sediment (not 
muddy brown casts), and history of influenza and diarrhea (as 
per above). His ___ resolved with fluids and 1U pRBC. His home 
Torsemide 60mg daily was reduced to 40mg daily given his 
continued diarrhea at discharge, and PCP should reconsider 
increasing back to home dose of 60mg daily at follow up visit. 
He was otherwise continued on his home Calcitriol and was Sodium 
Bicarbonate 650mg TID. Of note, he missed his Epo injection on 
___ and this was rescheduled to ___ at discharge. His discharge 
Cr was 2.9.

# Hypernatremia
Became mildly hypernatremic to 148 during his hospitalization 
likely in the setting of poor PO intake. Free water deficit of 
1.7 L. S/p 1L D51/2NS and increased H2O intake, with resolution 
of hypernatremia. Discharge Na of 142.

# Acute on chronic anemia
# Coagulopathy
Baseline Hgb ___, which has subsequently downtrended to 7.5. 
Additionally was coagulopathic. However, labs reassuring against 
DIC or hemolysis. Stool guaiac negative. His anemia was overall 
felt to be in part due to missing his Epo injection on ___, 
however this was rescheduled to ___ at discharge. He received 1U 
pRBC with an appropriate increase to Hgb 8.5. At discharge, his 
Hgb was 7.8. His coagulopathy was felt to be due to poor 
nutritional status in the setting of acute illness.

# Vasovagal syncope
Overnight on ___, had witnessed syncope episode while sitting 
up to use the urinal. Overall was most concerning for a 
vasovagal event in the setting of decreased BP and relative 
hypovolemia from influenza infection, particularly given 
positive orthostatics. No h/o seizure or arrhythmia. Remained 
syncope free for the rest of his hospitalization. 

# Hypertension
Patient on aggressive regimen as an outpatient. BP was elevated 
to 180s while in the ED in the setting of missing 
anti-hypertensive medications the day prior to admission. As 
such, continued his home regimen of Hydralazine 50mg BID, 
Carvedilol 25mg BID, Diltiazem 240mg daily, and Doxazosin 2mg 
QHS.

======================
CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES:
======================
# HIV
HIV well controlled with CD4 462 and VL<20 recently on ___. 
Continued home abacavir 300mg BID, efavirenz 600mg daily, and 
lamivudine 100mg daily

# CAD
Continued home aspirin 81mg daily, Pravastatin 20mg daily, 
Carvedilol 25mg BID, Diltiazem 240mg daily, and ISMN 120mg BID.

# HFpEF
For preload, initially continued home Torsemide 60mg daily 
(however this was held when the patient developed ___ and 
reduced to 40mg daily at discharge). For non-hormonal blockade, 
continued home Carvedilol 25mg BID. For afterload, continued 
home Hydralazine 50mg BID and Diltiazem 240mg daily. 

# GERD
Continued pantoprazole 20mg BID

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
=====================
[ ] PCP to follow up remaining stool studies: Cyclospora, final 
viral Cx
[ ] Recommend PCP obtain repeat CBC, BMP/lytes at follow up 
visit to ensure stable Hgb, Cr, and electrolytes
[ ] PCP to follow up abdominal pain, diarrhea
[ ] PCP to consider increasing Torsemide back to home dose of 
60mg daily pending continued diarrhea and electrolyte 
derangements (discharged on Torsemide 40mg daily)

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a very nice ___ YO ___ genleman with 
HIV, HCV (last CD4 1 month ago ~520) with diziness. He was in 
his prior state of health until yesterday afternoon, when he was 
pushing a bed at work and started feeling dizzy. Patient states 
that there was diaphoresis and blurry vision associated with the 
episode. Pt. states he felt he was going to pass out. He sat 
down and felt better. Pt felt his neoropathy symptoms 
(parestesias in elbows), but more intense as well. Pt denies, 
fever, chills, fotofobia, sphincter relaxation, frequency, 
abnormal movements, aura or vertigo. He also states he felt very 
weak and had trouble getting home due to weakness and diziness. 
He was able to sleep and was at baseline in the morning. He 
started his regular activities and symptoms recurred, and 
increased in intesity. He saw his primary care and was sent to 
our ER.

EKG: Sinus rhythm. Non-specific slight ST segment elevation in 
leads I, aVL, V1-V4. Non-specific T wave flattening in leads III 
and aVL.

CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

HEAD CT W/O CONTRAST:
1. No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. 
2. Mild atrophy. 
3. Nonspecific white matter hypodensity in both cerebral 
hemispheres, may 
reflect chronic microvascular ischemia, but HIV encephalopathy 
is also a 
consideration. MRI of the brain may be beneficial for further 
evaluation of the extent white matter abnormality.

ETT: Average functional exercise capacity. Non-specific ECG 
changes in the absence of anginal type symptoms to achieved 
workload. 
Blunted heart rate response to exercise.

Echo: The patient exercised for 9 minutes and 30 seconds 
according to a Modified ___ treadmill protocol ___ METS) 
reaching a peak heart rate of 105 bpm and a peak blood pressure 
of 184/80 mmHg. The test was stopped because of fatigue. This 
level of exercise represents an average exercise tolerance for 
age. In response to stress, the ECG showed non-diagnostic ST 
changes (see exercise report for details). There was a blunted 
heart rate response to stress. The blood pressure response to 
exercise was normal. 
Resting images were acquired at a heart rate of 64 bpm and a 
blood pressure of 128/68 mmHg. These demonstrated mild symmetric 
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal regional and global 
left ventricular systolic function. Doppler demonstrated trace 
aortic regurgitation with no aortic stenosis or significant 
mitral regurgitation or resting LVOT gradient. 
Echo images were acquired within 50 seconds after peak stress at 
heart rates of 108 - 98 bpm. These demonstrated appropriate 
augmentation of all left ventricular segments with slight 
decrease in cavity size. There was augmentation of right 
ventricular free wall motion
Average functional exercise capacity. Non-specific ECG changes 
with no 2D echocardiographic evidence of inducible ischemia to 
achieved workload. Abnormal hemodynamic response to physiologic 
stress. Trace aortic regurgitation at rest. Suboptimal study. 
Target HR not achieved.

MRI:
1. Hyperintense periventricular and subcortical white matter 
bilaterally. 
Given the patient's age, this may represent small vessel 
ischemic disease. 
However, given the patient's past medical history, HIV 
encephalopathy is not excluded. 
2. No foci of abnormal enhancement. 
3. Diffuse cortical atrophy, likely age-related. 
4. Posterior disc herniation at C4-C5 seen to indent the spinal 
cord, a 
followup cervical spine MR study is recommended for complete 
characterization.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
In our ER he arrived with a BP of 151/88, HR 82, T 97.9, RR 16, 
SaO2100%. Pt had an Iv put in and received labetalol 10mg IV x1. 
He had a CXR that did not show any acute pathology and a CT scan 
negative for hemorrhage, but some non-specific white matter 
lesions. A neurology consult was called. Neurology do not think 
this is a stroke. Patient was admitted to medicine for further 
workup.

In the floor patient's SBP was 150-180, so labetalol 200mg TID 
was started. Patient's BP responded adequatelly to this. Patient 
was put in telemetry, where there were no abnormalities found.

Mr. ___ had an MRI of the brain, which showed hyperintense 
periventricular and subcortical white matter bilaterally, 
suggesting small vessel ischemid disease, which did not look 
like HIV encephalopathy or PML. However, this cannot be ruled 
out.

Patient was without any chest pain during hospitalization and BP 
was 120/80 during remaining of hospitalization. Negative cardiac 
enzymes x2. Patient had a stress test, but did not achieve goal 
HR (Pt on labetalol). Since the BP change was so sudden and 
patient with adequate follow up as outpatient and has not known 
hypertension, secondary causes for hypertension were worked up. 
Patient had 24-hour metanephrins ordered.

Patient was discharged home with follow up with his primary care 
within the next day.

Discharge Instructions:
You were seen at the ___ due to diziness. In the ER you were 
found to be hypertensive up to the 170s and you were given 
medicines to keep your blood pressure down. Neurology saw you 
and thought you were not having a stroke; you also had a CT of 
your head that did not show any bleeding or old stroke.
You were admitted to medicine for fuerther workup. You had a MRI 
of your head, because of some ___ in the CT, 
that were not clearly seen. The MRI corroborated those lesions, 
which need to be followed clinically. Your echocardiogram and 
stress test showed that your heart does not have any anatomical 
abnormalities or abormalities in movement.
We ordered cardiac enzymes and EKG, which were also negative for 
ischemia (heart attack).
We are ready to go home; however, if you feel chest pain, 
sweating again, worsening diziness, spining around, fever, 
chills or any other thing that concerns you please come back to 
the ER.
Since your blood pressure was suddengly high, with prior good 
measurements, we got concerned for a condition called 
pheochromocytoma that could expalin this symptoms. We asked for 
a test called ""metanephrins"" in urine. We will ask you to colect 
the urine of 24h and bring it back.
Also, we recommend to have your lipids checked within the next  
year by your primary care. ___ show him this information.

with abdominal pain and diarrhea. 

He reports approximately three months of chronic abdominal pain 
with diarrhea. His symptoms have markedly worsened over the last 
3 days. He now has nearly ___ episodes of diarrhea per day. He 
describes these episodes that begin with headaches and blurry 
vision, progressing to abdominal pain and diarrhea. The

AnGap-___ male with HIV and hepatitis C was admitted with diarrhea 
and abominal pain. 

1. Diarrhea
Etiology of his abdominal pain and diarrhea is unclear but is 
certainly concerning for infectious etiology or malignancy. His 
most recent CD4 count is 492, making him at low risk for most 
opportunistic infections. A c-scope was deferred b/c of 
hyperkalemia. His symptoms improved overnight and his abd pain 
resolved, so his procedure was deferred to outpatient.  His 
already scheduled o/p c-scope was arranged to be sooner.  C 
diff, and other routine pathogens (including campylobacter, 
shigella, yersinia, Ecoli O15___ and vibrio were negative, but O 
and P was still pending.  Of note, the patient has already had 
an full o/p w/u for diarrhea in an HIV patient. 
.
2. Hyperkalemia
The test was repeated and was without hemolysis.  His ecg was 
normal. This suggests that the high K may have been real and 
possibly secondary to his ACEI.  His lisinopril was held. He was 
given lasix and fluid d and his K came down to 4.7.  He was 
discharged off his ACEI to follow up and get a repeat K.  
.
3. HIV: Stable.  Continued home regimen
.
4. Benign Hypertension: As stated above, his lisinopril was 
discontinued due to hyperkalemia.  He was started on amlodipine 
5 mg daily after his blood pressure was running in the 150s, 
with good effect.  He had some mild orthostatic hypotension with 
norvasc initiation after his diuresis the day prior.  He felt 
well at discharge with a blood pressure of 122/68.
.
5. abd pain: of unclear etiology. He did have some AST/ALT 
elevation, but he has known hep C. A RUQ u/s was negative. An 
Abd CT was normal. His pain resolved without intervention.
.
6. Headache: The patient presented with a HA that resolved 
without intervnetion. A head CT done int he ER was normal.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with h/o HTN, HIV and HCV 
cirrhosis c/b portal HTN, who complains of anterior substernal 
chest pressure intermittently over the last 3 days. Pain has 
been occurring up to ___ times per day, lasting 30 minutes at a 
time. The pain is nonradiating and not a/w exertion; no 
associated nausea/vomiting/diaphoresis. Patient initially 
believed the pain was due to GERD which has had in the past. 
However, today while waiting for the bus he experienced acute 
onset of more severe substernal chest pain associated with 
dizziness and lightheadedness. He called EMS. PTA received ASA 
324mg, NTG SL sprays which brought pain from an 8 to a 6. 
Received one SL NTG which did not relieve pain at all. Given 
Morphine 4mg IV which made him chest pain free.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 92 146/80 20 98%. Labs and 
imaging significant for Trop 0.13. EKG showed ST elevations in 
leads V1 - V3 (consistent with prior), but new TWI in leads 2, 3 
and AVF. He was bolused with Heparin and started on Heparin gtt. 
Sent to cath lab where was found to have complete occlusion of 
RCA and tight lesions in LAD and upper pole of diag; DES placed 
in all 3 arteries.
.
On arrival to the floors, initial vitals are 71 158/87 18 100%

CATH REPORT (___):
.
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated two vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was 
patent.
The LAD had an 80% stenosis mid-vessel and a bifurcating D1 with 
90%
stenosis at the upper pole and 70% at the lower pole. The LCX 
had no
angiographically apparent coronary disease. The RCA had a 95% 
distal
lesion before the bifurcation.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial 
systolic
hypertension (SBP 172 mmHg).

 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:    
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Systolic hypertension.

POST-CATH ECHO (___):
.
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are 
normal (LVEF 70%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left 
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending 
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are 
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are

mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) 
of ___, resting findings are similar. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
1. NSTEMI: Patient presented with chest pain and elevated 
troponin, as well as EKG showing new TWI in leads 2, 3 and AVF. 
He was bolused with Heparin and started on Heparin gtt. Sent to 
cath lab where was found to have complete occlusion of RCA and 
tight lesions in LAD and upper pole of diag. Drug-eluting stents 
were placed in the RCA, LAD and upper pole of diagonal branch. 
After the procedure, patient was chest-pain free. He was started 
on ASA 325, Plavix 75mg daily, and Metoprolol. As the patient 
had elevated Cr 1.3, he was not started on Lisinopril at this 
time. He was also started on a low-dose statin rather than the 
usual high-dose statin for post-MI cardioprotection as he has 
history of Hep C cirrhosis. 
.
2. HYPERTENSION: Patient was switched from Amlodipine to 
Metoprolol during admission as Metoprolol has improved survival 
benefits post-MI. 
.
3. COPD: stable on home combivent
.
4. HIV: per patient, viral loads have been undetectable. Last 
___ record from ___ shows undetectable viral loads. Continued 
on home HAART regimen. Patient follows up with outpatient 
provider ___ 4 months.
.
5. HCV cirrhosis: inactive problem during this admission. 
However as he was started on low-dose statin during 
hospitalization will need LFTs checked again as outpatient

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr ___ is a ___ year old male who came in for lightheadedness 
and hypertension and was found to have hyponatremia. In the 
hospital, his lisinopril was discontinued and his hypertension 
medications were adjusted with the advice of the renal team. He 
had transient diarrhea but felt better. He was discharged home 
with services and will begin cardiac rehab and see his primary 
care doctor.

# Hyponatremia
Presented with a sodium level of 125, a new issue. At discharge, 
Na was 133. Most likely etiology of hyponatremia, given acute 
onset, is drug-induced from lisinopril, which was recently 
started. Hypovolemia likely given his admitted decrease in PO 
intake and decrease in appettite. He appeared euvolemic on exam 
after IV fluids in the ED. He denied other medications as well.

Fluid I/O and electrolytes were monitored and returned to 
normal. An abdominal ultrasound ruled out ascites. Simvastatin 
was replaced by pravastatin 40 mg p.o. QD and metoprolol and 
amlodipine were replaced by carvedilol 6.25 mg p.o. BID. If it 
is well tolerated, to be increased by outpatient providers.

# Lightheadedness
Dizziness unlikely of cardiac origin given the normal recent 
stress test and lack of chest pain. No evidence for stroke - 
moving all extremities, equal strength. No evidence for low 
blood pressure or hypovolemia. Has had dizziness in past. 
Symptoms have resolved at time of discharge. Likely hypovolemia 
in the setting of decreased PO intake and decreased appettite. 

# HTN
Chronic issue for which he recently saw his cardiologist. His 
medications were adjusted as above. Normotensive through 
hospitalization. Will follow up with cardiologist and primary 
care (___) and initiating cardiac rehab ___.

OTHER ISSUES
# CAD
History of NSTEMI ___ with cath; Angina in past. Stable on 
amdission, maintained on Plavix and aspirin and other HTN 
medications as above. Had cardiac rehab scheduled for ___.

# Anemia
Chronic anemia, with Hct at baseline. Possibley due to HIV or 
CKD.

# Chronic Kidney Disease
Current Cr of 1.3 in line with baseline creatinine of 1.0-1.3. 
Thought to be secondary to HIV.

# COPD - chronic issue per OMR with short distance dyspnea on 
exertion. Has cardiac rehab scheduled for ___.

c/b portal hypertension, chronic hyponatremia who presented with 
atypical chest discomfort that was most likely noncardiac in 
etiology.  Evaluation of chronic hyponatremia was consistent 
with inappropriate secretion of ADH. 

ACTIVE ISSUES:

1.  chest pain: patient presented with atypical chest pain which 
resolved spontaneously prior to presentation to the emergency 
department.  Cause of chest discomfort was unclear, but there 
was low concern for a cardiac etiology with unchanged serial 
EKGs, normal cardiac enzymes x 2 and recent normal persantine 
stress results.  CXR was within normal limits and patient denied 
any symptoms consistent with musculoskeletal or gastointestinal 
causes of pain.  Patient continued on his aspirin, plavix, 
carvedilol and simvastatin for significant history of coronary 
artery disease.

2.  hyponatremia: Patient presented with asymptomatic 
hyponatremia which has been present for the past several months. 
  Evaluation was consistent with inappropriate secretion of ADH 
with euvolemic volume status, urinary Na excretion persistently> 
20 and urine osmolality in 300s.   TSH and am cortisol were 
within normal limits.  Patient was also administered carefully 
monitored IVF challenge x 2 to ensure that hypovolemia was not 
the cause of hyponatremia, especially given the history of poor 
oral intake/ failure to thrive.  Serum sodium did not improve 
with fluid challenges and urine osmolality increased slightly.  
The etiology of SIADH was not apparent with no clear 
precipitant: no evidence of malignancy or culprit drugs.  
Nephrology was consulted and recommended management with free 
water restriction and liberalization of salt intake.  Sodium 
should be periodically monitored as an outpatient, but at this 
time no further evaluation is warranted.

3. failure to thrive: patient complained of progressive appetite 
loss from unclear cause.  Although serum albumin was within 
normal limits, patient had prominent temporal wasting (of note, 
appearance may be partial due to lipodystrophy from long-term 
use of antiretrovirals).  He was started on low dose remeron as 
an appetite stimulant with dietary supplementation with all 
meals.  Nutritional status should be monitored as an outpatient.

CHRONIC MEDICAL PROBLEMS

4. HIV, asymptomatic: per patient well controlled with no 
evidence of opportunistic infections.  During hospitalization, 
he was continued on home antiretrovirals.    

5. HCV cirrhosis: LFTs and liver synthetic function at baseline. 
 Although patient has a history of portal hypertension which can 
be associated with chronic hyponatremia from RAS activation due 
to splanchnic vasodilitation, this did not seem to be the likely 
cause of electrolyte imbalance.  

6. HTN: continued on home dose of carvedilol

7. prostatitis: cont doxycycline

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old single Caucasian man with reported history 
of depression s/p one psychiatric hospitalization in ___ ___ for depression and suicidal ideation, 
history of intermittent cannabis use, who presented to ___ via 
EMS after his roommates were concerned for several hours of 
bizarre behaviors. ED course was notable for agitation with 
patient requiring mechanical and chemical restraints. 
. 
Initial presentation was concerning for severe psychosis with 
apparent acute onset (per collateral was seen by his parents 
about a week prior to presentation and appeared to be at his 
baseline) with ED course notable for grandiosity, irritability,
disorganized and tangential thought process, as well as 
agitation requiring numerous physical and chemical restraints. 
Interview on my examination was significantly more reassuring, 
with patient notably calm, cooperative with thought process that 
is linear, goal and future oriented. Of note, he denies AVH and 
he does not appear to be responding to internal stimuli. 
. 
In terms of etiology, presentation seems most consistent with 
substance induced psychosis, although the patient denies recent 
illicit substance use and his tox screen was negative on 
admission. Differential also includes brief psychotic disorder, 
bipolar disorder (although no clear history of mania in the 
past-- remains on the differential given young age with ?family 
history of bipolar). Has reportedly been depressed in the past, 
but denies depressive symptoms on examination and does not 
appear dysthymic or dysphoric on examination.

- Patient was counseled to avoid using illicit drugs, including 
cannabis, as this may increase his risk for a recurrent episode

[] Patient should have follow up with PCP in the next 7 days to 
reevaluate knee after cessation of antibiotics and diarrhea

ACUTE ISSUES ADDRESSED
=======================
# Fever 
# Abdominal pain 
# Presumed C. diff colitis 
Patient presented with fever and abdominal pain. He was recently 
started on PO vanc for presumed C. diff colitis. He continued to 
have diarrhea but remained afebrile, without leukocytosis, and 
with improving abdominal pain. Stool tests sent were remarkable 
for negative C. diff PCR, negative bacterial stool cultures. 
Decreased PO vancomycin to prophylactic dosing of 125mg BID. At 
time of discharge fever and abdominal pain had resolved, but 
patient did have ongoing loose bowel movements ___ daily 
without clear etiology. Suspect antibiotic associated/non 
infectious given that he was clinically well appearing 
otherwise. 

# R knee septic arthritis 
Patient had a R quad tendon rupture s/p quad tendon repair with 
course c/b sepsis c/f post op infection s/p R knee washout and 
debridement on ___. No growth from the OR cultures, but was 
started on a 4 week course of vanc/ceftriaxone (scheduled to end 
___ due to significant amount of polys and purulence noted 
during washout. Per OMR review, his knee was without erythema or 
purulence at his OPAT visit on ___. On exam on day of 
admission, patient's knee is very warm, erythematous, and tender 
to light touch, and CRP remains elevated at 95.8, which is 
concerning for a possible septic joint. ID was consulted and 
recommended joint aspiration initially, though with improvement 
in knee exam, aspiration and I&D were deferred. Continued IV 
vancomycin and ceftriaxone until ___. Patient was discharged 
off of antibiotics with plan for outpatient monitoring. 

# Hypokalemia 
# Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis 
# Hypovolemia ___ to Diarrhea 
Likely ___ GI losses, improved with IVF resuscitation and 
potassium repletion. 

# Acute on chronic normocytic anemia 
His current Hgb level is 9.5, slightly down from yesterday. 
Likely in the context of infection. Iron studies showed iron 
deficiency. Can start outpatient iron supplementation.

History of Present Illness:
HPI: History obtained with assistance from ___ interpreter. 

Ms. ___ is a ___ yo woman with PMH of HTN/HLD presenting with
left neck pain and generalized weakness. 

She was recently discharged from ___ after an admission for a
viral illness which causes nausea and vomiting but has had
persistent weakness and anorexia. She denies fevers/chills,
n/v/d/abd pain, urinary sx, cp/SOB/cough, but says she has had
minimal appetite for weeks and has been constipated for a few
days. She notes that she does not feel at all confused at this
time but did have some confusion after her last admission. She
states that sometimes when walking she feels generally weak with
some dizziness and a feeling of numbness in her legs. 

Her primary complaint today is anterior left neck pain x3 days
which is sometimes associated with weakness in her left arm. 
She says that the neck pain started about one week ago and is in
able to point to a precipitating factor like exercise, lifting
heavy things, etc. She denies headaches, vision changes, or 
other
associated sx. She reports that she came into the hospital
instead of going to her PCP for this because she thought it was
severe enough to go to the hospital and because her family was
worried about her, especially since she has lost weight over the
last month. She thinks she lost weight because of the impact her
recent viral illness had on PO intake. 

Per report, the patient has been persistently failing at home
leading to repeated hospital admissions despite having a ___.  

In ED, initial vitals 98.2 101 149/79 16 100% RA. Received GI
cocktail, 1L NS, 600mg ibuprofen. CXR showed mild bronchial wall

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo woman with PMH of HTN/HLD presenting with left neck pain 
and generalized weakness.      

#Neck pain: One week of neck pain without clear etiology as no
clear precipitating factors. Patient had recent viral illness 
but
denies f/c, n/v, headache, vision changes, other neurologic
changes which would be concerning for meningitis so no need for
LP. Pain is focal on left side of neck without
notable exam findings. Pt reports intermittent arm weakness but
neurological exam completely intact, Spurling test negative, no
point tenderness over spine or signs of spinal injury. No bruit
or thrill no raise concern for vascular abnormality, no mass or
lymphadenopathy to raise concern for infection. XR and CT of 
C-spine show severe cervical DJD as well as calcification of 
carotids R>L. Pain improved with ibuprofen and home tramadol on 
which she was discharged, may benefit from longstanding tx with 
COX-2 inhibitor as allergic to APAP. 

#Weakness/anorexia/gait abnormality: Exam relatively 
unremarkable, patient mentating well, but appears to
be failing at home based on multiple recent admissions. Poor PO
intake appears to be slow recovery from recent viral illness, 
but
could be part of overall subacute decline. Continued on home 
mirtazapine. Evaluated by nutrition who felt that patient has 
good diet but would benefit from Ensure supplementation. 
Evaluated by ___ who cleared patient for home without additional 
services. In conversation with patient, daughter, and social 
work, team able to get collateral information that patient has 
numerous services at home through elder services and daughter is 
considering applying for assisted living but has been anxious 
about mother's ability to function at home. Overall, patient is 
largely healthy, cognitive intact, and safe to ambulate on her 
own. Will benefit from maximal services available from elder 
services but is largely functioning well with good supports. 

#HTN: EKG with LBBB and LVH, exam notable for S4 making some end
organ damage from longstanding hypertension likely. Chem 7 wnl. 
Stable on home losartan. 
 Will follow up with PCP regarding HTN management, consideration 
of TTE, and ophthalmology f/u given evidence of end organ 
damage. 

#GERD: Stable on home omeprazole

#Anemia: Hgb 10.3->9.4 with unclear baseline. Likely ___ 
dilution as all cell lines down. Patient on home iron 
supplementation and aware of anemia. Will need ongoing 
outpatient monitoring, discharged with home iron 
supplementation. 

Transitional issues:
-Found to have extensive DJD of the cervical spine. Would 
consider outpatient discussion of longterm medications such as 
COX-2 inhibitors. 
-Extensive calcification of the right carotid bifurcation with 
less significant left carotid calcification seen on CT C-spine. 
Follow up with PCP. 
-Patient and family interested in referral to geriatrics for 
ongoing primary care. 
-Patient would benefit from maximal resources from elder 
services including access to nutritional supplementation 
-Given LVH on EKG and S4 on exam, may benefit from outpatient 
TTE for evaluation of structural heart disease. Additionally 
would benefit from ophthalmology eval as outpatient given 
evidence of end organ damage from HTN.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. 
Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:
On POD #1, patient was given 500ml IV fluid bolus for 
hypotension, which she responded to appropriately. Patient was 
noted to have some post-op delirium and dilaudid was decreased 
in dosage from ___ to 0.5-2mg every 4 hours as needed. 
Oxycodone and tramadol was avoided due to reported allergy. 
Morphine was avoided due to slightly elevated creatinine of 1.4. 
Overnight, patient was noted to have increased delirium with 
temp of 100.2 and urinalysis, repeat CBC was completed. UA was 
negative, hematocrit was 25.5 and WBC 12.8.

On POD #2, hematocrit was 24.2. and WBC 12.7. Patient was 
triggered for change in mental status in the afternoon and Tmax 
of 102.0. Patient was noted to have increased delirium with new 
oxygen requirement (88-90% on room air) and slightly tachycardic 
with HR in the low 100s. A fever work-up was completed, 
including urinalysis/cultures, blood cultures and chest x-ray. 
UA was borderline, showing moderate leukocytes, WBC 12, negative 
nitrates/epi. Chest X-ray showed pacification of the right and 
left lungs, with slight blurring of the pulmonary vessels 
represent atelectasis, however cannot exclude pneumonia. Patient 
was not given Tylenol due to reported allergy and was not given 
any other alternative PO anti-pyretic medication due to 
confusion at the time/inability to swallow pills. Cool pack/ice 
was given to the patient and fever resolved on its own. Patient 
remained afebrile overnight. Gabapentin was discontinued and no 
further narcotic medications were given. The Medicine team was 
consulted for co-management of care due to complex past medical 
history and recommended empiric treatment with Levaquin if cough 
develops or consideration of further testing to rule out PE if 
patient remained tachycardic or hypoxic.

On POD #3, hematocrit was 23.5, WBC 11.7 (downtrending) and 
creatinine improved to 1.2. Patient was alert and oriented to 
self, DOB, place. Patient reported right calf pain to palpation 
and a lower extremity ultrasound was obtained, which results 
were negative for DVT.

On POD #4, hematocrit was 22.3 and patient was transfused 1 unit 
packed red blood counts, which she tolerated well. 
Post-transfusion hematocrit was 29.4.

On POD #5, her hematocrit was stable at 25.9 and her creatinine 
was 1.3.  She was discharged to rehab with repeat lab follow-up 
(hematocrit and creatinine) within 2 days of discharge.  Her 
Lasix and Losartan continue to be held until creatinine 
stabilizes.  

Urine cultures showed mixed bacterial flora consistent with skin 
contamination, no treatment indicated. Blood cultures were 
pending at the time of discharge and patient will be contacted 
if further treatment is indicated.

Otherwise, the patient received Aspirin 325 mg twice daily for 
DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of POD#1.  The surgical 
dressing will remain on until ___. The patient was seen daily 
by physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout the hospital 
course and repleted accordingly. At the time of discharge the 
patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling well.  The 
patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The patient's 
hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately controlled on 
an oral regimen. The operative extremity was neurovascularly 
intact and the dressing was intact. 

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as 
tolerated on the operative extremity. 
 
Ms. ___ is discharged to rehab in stable condition.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with implantable penile prosthesis 
(___) now status post explant and re-implant (___) and 
subsequent explant (___) who presented to the emergency 
department for further evaluation after treatment with ten days 
of intravenous antibiotics. On review of his history, he 
remarked on vague pelvic/sacral pain in recent weeks which he 
attributed to his long bike ride before his whole ordeal with 
the prosthesis explant began. Additionally, he noted in recent 
days some rectal pain and pressure that had significantly 
worsened.  He reported some significant constipation. He denied 
nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills, flank pain. CT scan was 
performed after arriving to the ED and this was concerning for 
left perianal abcess. Surgery/Colorectal service and infectious 
disease notified and involved in management. Mr. ___ was thus 
taken urgently to the operating room for exploration and 
incision and drainage of the surgical site and the perianal 
site. Dr. ___ incision and drainage of scrotal and 
perirectal abscess while Dr. ___ incision and 
drainage of possible left
ischiorectal abscess.  Please see respective operative notes for 
full details. Mr. ___ tolerated the procedure well and 
arrived the PACU with both incision areas packed with 
wicks/gauze and with foley catheter in place. He was continued 
on empiric vancomycin and meropenem and hydrated with 
intravenous fluids and pain control was with intravenous and 
oral medications. 

The remainder of his hospital course was unremarkable. He was 
followed by consult services and he was eventually converted 
back to intravenous cefepime and metronidazole therapy was 
initiated. Once he could tolerate daily dressing/wick changes 
with oral pain medications, he was discharged home with home 
infusion services and ___ for wound care. Explicit instructions 
were provided. His Foley catheter was removed prior to discharge 
and given his incontinence, condom catheter was placed to reduce 
risk of wound contamination with urine. He was discharged in 
stable condition, tolerating dressing changes with oral 
antibiotics and with a three week course of intravenous CEFEPIME 
with PO METRONIDAZOLE. He was given explicit instructions for 
follow up with hematology, infectious disease and urology. All 
of his questions were answered.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ gentleman with a history of JAK2 
positive essential thrombocythemia and prostate cancer s/p 
radical prostatectomy in ___ c/b erectile dysfunction. He 
underwent penile prosthesis in ___ and has had a complicated 
course with multiple prosthesis infections. He presents with 
worsening R groin/perineal pain and leukocytosis.  

Patient's penile implant was originally placed in ___ for 
erectile dysfunction. In ___, patient developed 
infection that did not improve with PO Augmentin. He was 
admitted on ___ with worsening penile and scrotal swelling 
concerning for infected device, and he underwent wash-out and 
replacement of prosthesis on ___. Surgical culture grew 
pseudomonas. He remained febrile post op and his pre-op 
antibiotic regimen was changed from vancomycin-gentamycin to 
vancomycin and cefepime. He subsquently had the prosthesis fully 
removed on ___ and defervesced. His antibiotic regimen was 
narrowed to cefepime. PICC line was placed, and he was 
discharged with plans for ___ week course IV Cefepime. 
 
On ___, patient represented to the ED with ___ days groin and 
testicular pain. CT showed gas formation in peineal area. He was 
taken emergently to the OR on ___ for exploration of perineum 
with no evidence of active infection intraoperatively. He was 
initially covered with vancomycin and meropenem, then was 
transitioned back to cefepime with addition of metronidazole for 
anaerobic coverage on ___. Planned for ___ week course.  

On ___, patient was transitioned to PO cipro/flagyl. PICC 
was pulled. Antibiotics were stopped on ___ in the setting of 
possible antibiotic-associated diarrhea and improvement in exam. 
Diarrhea resolved.  

Over the past week, patient has had worsening R groin and 
perineal pain. He has needed to take oxycodone at night due to 
pain after weaning himself off one week prior. Pain worse 
movement, making walking difficult. Minimal increase in scrotal 
erythema. 2x packing areas changed daily, no issues with that. 
Endorses increased fatigue, denies fevers/chills, N/V/D. Saw PMD 
earlier this week, had CBC which showed WBC 20k. Of note, pt 
recently decreased hyydroxyurea for polycythemia.  

In the ED initial vitals were: 4 98.7 66 113/74 18 100% RA. Labs 
were significant for WBC 19 (86N, 0 band, 8L), H/H 13.9/39.1, 
plt 767. Cr 0.7. UA 23 WBC (chronic condom cath). CT Pel showed 
subcutaneous stranding and skin thickening in perineum and 
inferior medial gluteal regions and scrotum. Small collection of 
sub-q gas in L medal gluteal region substantially decreased from 
previous exam, may reflect packing material. No fluid 
collections.  
Urology was consulted, who did not feel there was an operative 
issue. Advised gen surg consult (they were involved in prior 
debridement), IV antibiotics, ID consult. General surgery agreed 
there was no indication for further I &D. Patient was given 
oxycodone, docusate, metronidazole, cefepime. Vitals prior to 
transfer were: 2 98.3 57 127/69 16 99% RA.  

On the floor, patient reports ongoing perineal pain R > L and 
posterior scrotal pain.

IMAGING:  
___  
CT Abd/Pel w Contrast  
1. Subcutaneous stranding and skin thickening involving the 
perineum and inferior medial gluteal regions as well as scrotum. 
Small collection of subcutaneous gas in the left medial gluteal 
region is substantially decreased from the previous exam, and 
may reflect packing material. No fluid collections.  
2. Bilateral hydroceles are improved.  
3. Reactive right inguinal lymphadenopathy.  

___
MRI pelvis w and wo contrast:
1. Edema and enhancement throughout the right adductor 
musculature and right aspect of the pelvic floor/perineum, may 
reflect a nonspecific myositis and may be 
infectious/inflammatory in nature although recent trauma could 
result in a similar imaging appearance; clinical correlation is 
recommended. Although adjacent edema within the right inferior 
pubic ramus potentially could be due to osteomyelitis, the 
absence of associated cortical erosion argues against this.  The 
changes are asymmetric and likely somewhat remote from a 
radiation field. 
2. Moderate subcutaneous edema along the right inguinal region, 
extending along the anteroinferior aspect of the pelvis, 
nonspecific in nature. Clinical correlation with evidence of 
cellulitis is recommended. 
3. Unchanged right inguinal lymphadenopathy, presumably 
reactive. 

___ 
L spine pelvis w and wo contrast:
1. No evidence of osteomyelitis or epidural abscess within the 
lumbar spine. 
2. Multilevel multifactorial degenerative changes throughout the 
lumbar spine, as described above. 

___
CT pelvis w/o contrast:
1. Indistinctness of the inferomedial cortex along the anterior 
aspect of the right inferior pubic ramus, corresponding to the 
area of marrow edema on the recent pelvis MRI, indeterminate in 
nature.  The possibly of osteomyelitis cannot be conclusively 
excluded.  No fracture line identified. 
2. Circumferential bladder wall thickening may be related to 
bladder's decompressed state; clinical correlation is 
recommended to exclude cystitis. 
3. Right inguinal lymphadenopathy, similar to the prior MRI from 
___. 

___
CXR line placement:
New left-sided PICC line ends in the low SVC. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ gentleman with a history of prostate 
cancer JAK2 positive essential thrombocythemia and prostate 
cancer s/p radical prostatectomy in ___ c/b erectile 
dysfunction. He underwent penile prosthesis in ___ and has had 
a complicated course with multiple prosthesis infections. He 
presents with worsening R groin/perineal pain and leukocytosis 
in the setting of recent antibiotic cessation.

# Osteomyelitis / groin soft tissue infection:
He had perineal pain and leukocytosis concerning for recurrent 
infection in the setting of multiple previous infections after 
radical prostatectomy and penile implant. No abscess or fluid 
collection seen on CT. He was evaluated by urology and general 
surgery who determined no acute surgical intervention was 
needed. He was followed by wound care for management of his 
surgical dressings. MRI and CT showed concern for osteomyeltis 
of the pubic ramus vs small fracture. A bone biopsy was 
considered but deferred given the technical difficulty of the 
procedure and risk for complications. He had PICC placement with 
plan for vancomycin/cefepime/Flagyl for a total 6 week course 
for presumptive osteomyelitis.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Essential Thrombocytosis: 
His platelet count was near baseline. There was suspicion for 
additional marrow dysplasia given increase in all 3 hematogenous 
cell lines during admission. He was titrated back to his 
previous home dose of 1000 mg hydroxyurea alternating with 
1500mg daily per ___ hematology recommendations.

# Thrombosed External Hemorrhoid:
Previously on steroid creams. He was given Hydrocortisone 
(Rectal) BID during admission.

# Depression: Continued citalopram  

# Constipation: Received Senna / Colace as needed.

TRANSITION ISSUES:
- His hydroxyurea for essential thrombocytosis was restored to 
daily alternating doses of 1gm / 1.5 gm.
- He will need to complete a 6 week course of 
vancomycin/cefepime/flagyl for presumptive osteomyelitis (last 
day of therapy ___.

## Additional Transitional Issues per Previous Urology Notes:
- Pelvic floor ___ to address incontinence  
- When scrotal incision closed, d/c condom cath  
- Consider re-implant of prosthesis after 6 months and urinary 
issues resolved

IMAGING:  
___ MRI Prostate:  
There is persistent edema and enhancement throughout the 
inferomedial right pubic ramus and surrounding adductor 
musculature, which is slightly improved from ___. The 
absence of cortical destruction limits the conclusion of 
osteomyelitis, however, this cannot be excluded. No abscess.  

___ CT Abd & Pelvis With Contrast: 
1. No retroperitoneal hematoma. 
2. Increased sclerosis of the inferior right pubic ramus 
reflects the underlying chronic inflammatory process. No 
definite evidence for acute osteomyelitis. For additional 
details, please see the recent prostate MRI. 
3. Unchanged, mild splenomegaly. 
 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with h/o prostate cancer, penile prosthesis c/b infection 
and pubic ramus osteomyelitis s/p prolonged antibiotic course

# Osteomyelitis / groin soft tissue infection: Pt with worsening 
pain and rising inflammatory markers (CRP 11.6 to 81 in last 10 
days) since discontinuing vanc/cefepime/metronidazole, 
suggesting antibiotic failure. No abscess on imaging. Ortho 
initially consulted but would defer open biopsy but do not see 
any need for debridement based on scans and defered to ___. S/P 
CT guided ___ biopsy of pubic ramus bone and surrounding tissue 
on ___. Culture growing pseudomonas sensitive to cefepime. Per 
ID recs will start vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl for at least 6

likely narrow treatment once culture final. An appointment was 
made for the pt to see urologist to monitor site of surgical 
prosthesis removal and assess for any nidus of recurrent 
infection.
 
# Anemia: Hct drop 29.3-> 24 since outpatient labs drawn ___. 
Anemia with macrocytosis may represent side effect of 
hydroxyurea. No evidence of bleeding on prelim read of CT 
abd/pelvis, stool guaiac neg. Schistocytes on automated smear 
concerning for hemolysis. However, hapto, LDH, and Tbili 
negative for hemolysis. Retic index 1.9%. H/H was elevated in 
___ but currently similar to ___ and prior H/H. ___ 
heme/onc followed the patient and we were in touch with 
outpatient ___ hematologist. Held hydrea given anemia due to 
infection. Will consider restarting as outpatient. Will have 
weekly labs sent to ___ clinic which will be entered in OMR and 
hematologist will follow them up.  s/p transfusion ___ for HCT 
21 and given patient will be discharged with H/H unlikely to

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure to take care of you at ___. You were 
admitted with groin and thigh pain concerning for recurrence of 
an infection in your bone called osteomyelitis. You were seen by 
the infectious disease team who recommended a biopsy of the 
infected area. Interventional radiology performed a biopsy of 
the pubic ramus bone. The preliminary culture of the bone and 
surrounding area grew pseudomonas, which is the same bacteria as 
your last culture. You were started on 3 antibiotics and your 
course will be determined by your infectious disease providers 
as an outpatient. We made a follow up with urology this week to 
examine your prior surgery site in order to evaluate for a 
persistent source of this infection. You are being sent home 
with tramadol for your pain. While taking tramadol you should 
take colace, senna, and miralax every day to prevent 
constipation and lactulose as needed if you do become 
constipated. You can skip these medications on days that you 
have loose stool.

We wish you the best!

Sincerely,
Your ___ medical team

Imaging/Studies:

1. No evidence of colitis, pancreatitis, our other acute 
intra-abdominal 
process. 
2. Chronic findings, including one liver and multiple renal 
hypodensities, too small for further characterization. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ year old M with PMH of CAD s/p 4V CABG 
and asthma and recent admission for colitis who presented with 4 
weeks of epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting.

Active Issues: 

# Abdominal Pain
Patient has past admission to ___ in ___ for similar symptoms, 
and workup was unrevealing. Given his history of colitis, 
gastritis and PUD were suspected. Infectious etiologies such as 
gastroenteritis were deemed less likely as he had been 
symptomatic for 4 weeks and had no risk factors such as travel, 
camping, or new foods. His lipase and LFTs were normal, so 
pancreatitis, hepatitis, or biliary pathology were thought to be 
unlikely. In addition, his abdominal CT was unrevealing. 
Finally, 2 serial troponins were <.01, and there was isolated T 
wave inversion in V2, so cardiac etiology not likely. He had no 
electrolyte abnormalities or weight loss, so he had been able to 
maintain adequate nutritional intake as an outpatient. He 
reported no known history of peptic ulcers, and H. pylori IgG 
was negative. He received Maalox, diphenhydramine, and lidocaine 
as well as Tylenol PRN pain, which helped alleviate his 
symptoms. He was continued on omperazole 40mg BID and placed on 
a full liquid diet, which he was able to advance slowly, with 
LUQ pain after eating but no vomiting.

# Chronic right upper extremity pain
This pain was thought to be neurogenic as patient laid on that 
arm for hours during his ___ suicide attempt. He had been 
asking his PCP to take him off of narcotics and agreed to 
transition to gabapentin. His hydrocodone-acetaminophen was 
discontinued and he was started on gabapentin 100mg TID, to be 
uptitrated as an outpatient.  

Chronic Issues:

# Coronary Artery Disease
s/p 4v CABG in ___. His EKG was unconcerning and there was no 
rise is serial troponin levels x 2. He continued on ASA 81mg 
daily and metoprolol 100mg BID. He had said upon admission that 
he was worried about taking ASA because he thought it might harm 
his stomach, but was reassured that he should stay on this 
medication.  

# Asthma
He had wheezing in the ED, but resolved after nebs--his wheezing 
was present once he arrived on the floor, for which he received 
albuterol nebs.  

# Depression/Anxiety
History of suicide attempt in ___. No SI. He was continued on 
sertraline, trazodone, and clonazepam BID PRN. He reported being 
in a depressed mood.  

Transitional Issues:

# Follow up on H Pylori serology (lab result pending at 
discharge). 
# Consider food allergy testing, although he did not report 
symptoms with one specific food.
# Consider GI referral as an outpatient, as he has had similar 
symptoms in the past, including an admission in ___, 
without clear cause. 
# Patient wanted to stop Vicodin. He was started instead on 
low-dose gabapentin for right arm pain. Please ___ 
response as an outpatient, consider uptitration. 
# Unclear why patient not on aspirin with history of coronary 
artery disease. Consider starting if indicated.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___.

You were admitted for abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. You 
received medications to help with these symptoms. Meanwhile, 
your blood tests and vital signs (like blood pressure) showed 
that you have been receiving adequate amounts of fluids and 
nutrition through the foods and liquids you drink. You had a CT 
scan which showed no cause for your symptoms. In addition, we 
were reassured that you were able to eat lunch without any 
problems. Therefore, it is safe for you to return home and you 
can complete other tests or procedures as an outpatient.  

It is likely that your pain is from inflammation in the stomach, 
called gastritis. This can be treated with medications you are 
on (omeprazole). Your symptoms could also be from ulcers in the 
stomach. We tested you for an bacteria called H. pylori which 
can cause ulcers, but the blood tests will not be back until the 
end of the week. We and your primary doctor can ___ on 
this. This can be treated (if you have it) with a short course 
of antibiotics. 

We recommend continuing on the Maalox and liquid lidocaine if 
needed to control your symptoms. Please follow up with your 
primary care doctor after discharge. 

We wish you a safe and healthy return home.

Sincerely,
Your ___ Team

has trouble breathing. When queried about whether there is 
coughing, the son states that the patient was at ___ 
___, and has been evaluated for aspiration; she is on a 
precautionary diet for this already. These episodes are not 
characterized by coughing. Rather, the patient becomes acutely 
short of breath unrelated to any obvious aggravating factor; he 
provides nebs and Maalox and tries to calm her down, and she 
seems to slowly improve over one hour. Of note, the son does 
have videos that show the patient's symptoms. She feels like she 
is in distress, with shortness of breath. She is also had mild 
nausea during the last week and on day of presentation which 
patient states is new. She presented to ___ yesterday

esophagus and no obstruction that could be causing these 
episodes. H. Pylori negative. There is an outpatient endoscopy 
pending by Dr. ___ at ___ to further evaluate the 
problem that has not yet occurred. However, her son describes 
being concerned about her breathing, and worrying that he does 
not know what to do for her and wanted to rule out cardiac 
causes as well.
To note, she was taking prednisone 10 mg daily at home per her 
son's report.

Imaging/Procedures
=====================
___ CXR
FINDINGS:  
Patient's chin obscures visualization of the lung apices.  There 
is no 
visualized consolidation, effusion, or edema.  The 
cardiomediastinal 
silhouette is stable.  Tortuosity of the thoracic aorta is again 
noted.  
Chronic deformity of the proximal left humerus suggests remote 
prior fracture. 
Old healed anterior right rib fractures are also noted.  No 
acute osseous 
abnormalities. 
  
IMPRESSION:   
No acute cardiopulmonary process. 

___ CXR
FINDINGS:  
Lung volume is low.  No consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural 
effusion is identified.  Mildly enlarged cardiomediastinal 
silhouette is unchanged.  Left humeral deformity is unchanged 
and is likely sequela of old fracture. 
  
IMPRESSION:    
No radiographic evidence of pneumonia. 

___ Video Oropharyngeal swallow study
FINDINGS:  
The study was limited due to the patient's body habitus and 
inability to relax shoulders.  Barium passes freely through the 
oropharynx without evident aspiration.  There was significant 
esophageal retention, which did not resolve with further 
swallowing attempts. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
Significant esophageal retention of barium.  This is likely 
related to severe esophageal dysmotility, if further evaluation 
is desired, a full esophogram can be performed. 
  
___ EGD
Findings:
 
Esophagus:  

 Lumen: A medium size hiatal hernia was seen.  

 Other presbyesophagus throughout the esophagus   

Stomach:  

Mucosa: Diffuse atrophic appearing mucosa of the mucosa with no 
bleeding was noted in the stomach. These findings are compatible 
with likely atrophic gastritis.  

Duodenum: Normal duodenum. 

Impression: 
- Presbyesophagus throughout the esophagus
- Atrophic appearing mucosa in the stomach compatible with 
likely atrophic gastritis 
- Medium hiatal hernia
- Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

Brief Hospital Course:
=========
Summary
=========
___ year old female with history of ___ disease, 
bilateral blindness, hypertension, history of bronchitis and 
reactive airway disease brought to the ED by her son with 
several weeks of recurrent episodes of shortness of breath, 
anxiety, and gasping for air. Patient was evaluated with video 
swallow study which showed esophageal dysmotility and esophageal 
retention of barium. Follow-up EGD was done which showed 
presbyesophagus. Patient was monitored with baseline diet of 
ground solids with thin liquids with medications whole with 
pureed solids. She tolerated the diet well and was discharged 
home

========================================
Acute medical/surgical issues addressed
========================================
# Esophageal dysmotility and esophageal retention of barium on
video swallow:
Patient presented with periordic episodes of shortness of breath 
and anxiety. Suspected that symptoms likely caused by esophageal 
reflux causing her to aspirate which exacerbates her reactive 
airway disease. Certainly ___ puts patient at risk for 
swallowing issues at baseline. Outpatient CT scan did not show 
any obvious esophageal obstruction. No current concern for 
infection given no leukocytosis, evidence on CXR of PNA, and pt 
has no fevers, productive cough. Breathing remained stable on 
room air and O2 sats >90%. Both GERD and reactive airway disease 
treatment were optimized at home and this continued here. Video 
swallow ___ revealed significant esophageal retention of 
barium concerning for severe esophageal dysmotility. GI 
consulted and recommended EGD ___ to evaluate for esophageal 
ring or other structural issue that could be causing retention. 
EGD revealed presbyesophagus and atrophic gastritis. Patient was 
advised to adhere to astrict aspiration precautions at home 
including eating more frequent, smaller meals, taking small 
bites and sips, sitting upright for all meals and medication 
administration and remain sitting upright for 1 hour after 
meals. Please eat only if awake, alert, and attentive.

# Reactive Airway Disease
Patient presented with episodes of SOB and anxiety that may 
represent asthma exacerbations from suspected aspirations. 
Breathing remained stable on room air and O2 sats >90%. 
Optimized reactive airway disease treatment is optimized at home 
with fluticasone IH BID, ipratropium bromide neb q6hs, 
levalbuterol neb q6hours, Perforomist IH BID, and prednisone 
10mg PO daily. While admitted patient was treated with duonebs 
q6hrs, advair BID, and prednisone 10mg daily. At discharge, 
patient was restarted on her home medications.

# Uncomplicated bacterial UTI: Patient asymptomatic but with 
floridly positive UA and urine culture growing E. coli. Patient 
was not oriented this AM but also received Ativan in the ED last 
night. Completed Bactrim DS BID (D1: ___. 

# Hypertension: not taking metoprolol as outpatient. Will need 
to verify medication list with son. ___ pressure well 
controlled overnight and SBP 150s now. Not on Metoprolol as was 
stopped at ___ due to hypotension.

# HLD: continued atorvastatin 20 daily

# GERD: continued pantoprazole 40 mg BID. Patient was discharged 
on pantoprazole 40mg PO BID and Maalox 10mL q6hrs PRN

# ___ disease: continued home Carbidopa-Levodopa 1.5 tab 
QID and 1mg at 7pm. Also continued Carbidopa 25mg QAM per son's 
home med list.

===================
Medication Changes
===================
- None

====================
Transitional Issues
====================
[ ] Continue baseline diet of ground solids with thin liquids 
with medications whole with pureed solids
[ ] Patient is currently taking oral prednisone 10mg daily. 
Appears this was started for possible asthma exacerbation but 
was no end date was given. Will discharge on prednisone 10mg 
daily but recommend tapering as outpatient.
[ ] Please ensure patient doing well with aspiration of cautions 
at home in setting of presbyesophagus.
[ ] If patient is not able to tolerate current diet, diet can be 
downgraded to puree solids. If patient is still having problems 
with aspiration, would have discussion with patient and family 
about PEG placement.
[ ] Patient is prescribed carbidopa 25mg BID, however, patient's 
son states her neurologist told him to give only once in the 
morning. Would clarify this with patient's neurologist

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

___ was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___.

Why was I in the hospital?
  - You were having episodes of shortness of breath at home and 
were brought in to be evaluated for potential causes of these 
episodes

What was done while I was in the hospital?
  - Your gastroesophageal reflux disease medications were 
reviewed and were felt to be optimized already
  - Your reactive airway disease/asthma medications were 
reviewed and we felt you were on an optimum regimen at home 
already.
  - You had a video swallow study which showed you had trouble 
swallowing foods. We did a follow-up EGD done which showed that 
you have a condition called presbyesophagus, a common condition 
seen in elderly individuals that predisposes you to having 
trouble swallowing and gastroesophageal reflux. 

What should I do when I go home?
  - It is very important that you take your medications as 
prescribed. We will provide you with a list of medications at 
discharge that you should continue to take
  - To prevent choking and aspiration of food, which is likely 
the cause of your episodes of shortness of breath and discomfort 
at home, we recommend:
       - Please eat more frequent, smaller meals and take small 
bites and sips. 
       - Please remember to sit upright for all meals and

SUMMARY
========
___ year old female w/ Parkinsons, esophageal dysmotility, 
reactive airway disease requiring lev-albuterol referred from 
her PCP as her UTI felt by history UTIs resistant to PO options 
initiated IV ceftriaxone transitioned to PO cefpodoxime 
following sensitivities of Klebsiella (panSN) and Morganella 
(resistant) w/course c/b lethargy and confusion from toxic 
metabolic encephalopathy, resolved and at baseline at time of 
d/c.

ACUTE ISSUES:
===============
#Uncomplicated UTI: Patient failed 3 days of cipro as outpatient 
and urine culture returned with pansensitive klebsiella and 
morganella resistant to cipro and Bactrim. Admitted for IV Abx 
per PCP ___. Patient is at risk for urinary 
retention given ___ disease but with normal PVR today. 
Treated for total of 5 day course given patient is at higher 
than normal risk of recurrence given comorbidities. Will 
discharge on Cefpedoxime 100mg q12hr for 2 days to complete ___.

#Deconditioning: Patient with reported significant weakness and 
already has home ___. Son reports increased burden with moving 
her over the last several days leading up to admission. ___ 
evaluated and recommended home with max services.

#Encephalopathy secondary to UTI: Noted by patient's sons to 
have lethargy at home and increasing confusion. Per sons, she is 
normally alert and oriented to self, her sons, and to place at 
baseline but does not know date or time. Was A&O to self only on 
admission exam but improved with treatment of infection. At 
discharge, patient able to state she is in the hospital in 
___ and that the day of ___ Day. This is consistent with 
her baseline. We will continue to hold home alprazolam, 
trazodone, and oxycodone given high risk for delirium with these 
medications. Plan to follow-up with PCP to discuss resuming 
these medications.

# Sacral ulcer
Noted on admission and continued wound care with balmex 
placement daily. Patient to go home with ___ services for wound 
care and follow-up with PCP for management.

#Malnutrition risk: Patient on pureed/nectar thick with ensure 
enlive 2xday and high calorie boost 1x/day. Should continue this 
on discharge.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
# Esophageal dysmotility: Previously found to have esophageal 
retention of barium on video swallow and esophageal reflux 
causing her to aspirate which exacerbates her reactive airway 
disease. Prior EGD revealed presbyesophagus and atrophic 
gastritis. Has hiatal hernia, not surgical candidate. Followed 
by GI as outpatient. Family is holding home hyoscyamine. 
Symptoms are stable here on aspiration precautions with pureed 
diet and nectar thickened liquids. Consider repeat swallowing 
evaluation as outpatient to ensure patient on optimal diet 
consistency. Will discharge on home Nexium.

# Reactive Airway Disease: Hx of SOB and anxiety that may 
concerning for asthma exacerbations from suspected aspirations. 
Reactive airway disease treatment is optimized at home with 
fluticasone IH BID, ipratropium bromide neb q6hs, levalbuterol 
neb q6hours, Perforomist IH BID, and prednisone 10mg PO daily.

Brief Hospital Course:
Brief summary: 

This is a ___ with ___ disease, esophageal dysmotility, 
reactive airway disease presenting from home via EMS with 
inability to ambulate. In the ED she was hypotensive, 
transiently mildly hypoxic, and clearly weak and 
encephalopathic. She was found to have a UTI and also thought to 
be hypovolemic. She improved very impressively with fluid 
resuscitation and antibiotic therapy, to near-baseline (though 
very poor functional status at this baseline). Her antibiotics 
were transitioned to a narrowed spectrum oral regimen prior to 
discharge.

Detailed summary:

# Urinary tract infection: Patient presenting with inability to 
ambulate, found to have positive urinalysis on admission. 
Patient denied symptoms, and was afebrile and without 
leukocytosis, but given her encephalopathy and difficulty 
ambulating, treatment was initiated with ceftriaxone. She 
improved with therapy. Urine culture with >100K E coli, 
pansusceptible. Narrowed to amoxicillin at discharge.
- Complete course of amoxicillin 500mg PO TID x5 more days

# Acute toxic metabolic encephalopathy: Patient sleepy but 
arousable on initial interview, with subsequent course notable 
for waxing/waning alertness. She improved with treatment of UTI 
and dehydration/hypovolemia.

# Inability to ambulate: Patient presenting with inability to 
ambulate, likely due to hypovolemia and UTI. Patient was noted 
to have right nasolabial flattening on exam, son is not sure if 
this was new; neurological exam otherwise seems to be at 
baseline and strength intact in upper and lower extremities and 
head CT was performed for this reason and was negative - likely 
gravitational based on serial exams. She was continued on her 
usual ___ disease medications. Her physical functioning 
improved to near-baseline (which is poor) after treatment of 
UTI/dehydration. She was seen by ___ who recommended discharge 
back to home with 24 hour care.

# Hypotension
# Hypovolemia/dehydration: Patient noted on arrival to be 
hypotensive to the systolic ___, not clearly symptomatic. 
Patient appeared dry on exam, and per report from son has not 
had much to eat or drink day of admission. BPs improved with 
IVF. Of note, patient also on prednisone 10 mg per day at home, 
completed steroid taper from last admission.

# Acute hypoxic respiratory failure: Patient found to be 
hypoxic, requiring 1L oxygen via NC in the ED. Patient was able 
to be weaned to room air upon arrival. CXR clear without 
evidence of pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or aspiration. On exam, 
patient has no wheezing to suggest acute exacerbation of her 
reactive airway disease. ___ have been aspiration event.  
Followed by Dr. ___. Home medications were continued.

# Thrush: Mild. Resolved with some nystatin. 
- Rinse mouth after inhaled steroids

# Esophageal dysmotility: Continued aspiration precautions with 
pureed solids and thickened liquids. She was seen by SLP who 
felt she was doing fairly well and could likely tolerate thin 
liquids (no straws).

# Anemia: Chronic, stable
# ___ disease: Continued carbidopa/levodopa
# Glaucoma: Continued eye gtts
# Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine
# Hypertension: Controlled without medications
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued atorvastatin
# Anxiety: Continued alprazolam as needed
# Insomnia: Continued trazodone; substitute ramelteon for 
melatonin

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF SUMMARY: 

___ with advanced ___ disease, dementia, esophageal 
motility, reactive airway disease presenting with tachypnea in 
the setting of severe constipation. It was thought that she was 
tachypneic due to (1) alteration of respiratory mechanics in the 
setting of abdominal distension from constipation along with (2) 
some aspiration occurring in the setting of her chronic 
oropharyngeal and esophageal dysphagia worsened by the 
aforementioned tachypnea and missing her ___ 
medications. Tachypnea slowly resolved as her constipation 
resolved and she was kept NPO. She was evaluated by SLP during 
this resolution phase and was cleared for her usual diet. She 
appeared to return to her usual baseline and so was discharged 
to home with her usual services and her sons' excellent 
attentive care.

DETAILED SUMMARY:

# Tachypnea
# Mild intermittent hypoxia
# Acute hypoxic respiratory failure
# Esophageal dysmotility: Likely aspiration in setting of 
advanced reactive airways disease and underlying restrictive 
lung mechanics due to advanced kyphosis. This was all likely 
worsened/precipitated by progressive constipation, for which she 
is unable to compensate due to her kyphosis -- leads to 
tachypnea and then tachypnea leads to aspiration which then 
precipitates a viscious cycle of more tachypnea and aspiration. 
Missing her medications also likely contributing. SLP evaluated 
her ___ and felt she was unsafe for any PO, but she appeared to 
do better ___ so diet was advanced and she tolerated this well. 
She appeared to return to her baseline by today ___ and so was 
discharged home.
- Note: A G tube can be considered for her, if in the future she 
really cannot meet her nutritional goals and can't take meds, 
but when we involved her in the discussion she said she did not 
want one. She improved so this was not explored further, but it 
may present a potential barrier to pursuing tube placement in 
the future. 

# Constipation: Severe on presentation but now moving her 
bowels. We adjusted her bowel medications to maintain 1BM per 
day. Counselled son on the following regimen:
- Standing senna now BID, Miralax now daily
- PRN Bisacodyl given HS if no BM that day

# Acute toxic metabolic encephalopathy
# Dementia: Baseline cognitive status per ___ is ""pretty high 
functioning,"" but apparently always thinks that it is ___ 
(with air conditioning always on at home), and is not oriented 
to events. Agitation on admission likely driven by recent 
constipation followed by repeated visits to the ED overnight. At 
home pt is maintained on low dose alprazolam which typically 
provides benefit for her anxiety and agitation. She improved by 
the AM after admission and appeared to be at her baseline for 
the remainder of her hospital stay.

# Advanced ___ disease: Slowly progressive per its usual 
course. Now quite advanced. Most of her above issues are the 
result of this condition. Her home medications were continued 
according to her precise home schedule and she did well. 
Neurology was not consulted this admission given her 
improvement. 

# Anemia: Chronic, stable
# Glaucoma: Continued home eye gtts
# Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued atorvastatin
# Anxiety: Continued alprazolam as needed
# Insomnia: Continued low dose home trazodone; substitute 
ramelteon for melatonin

>30 minutes spent coordinating discharge home

The patient was recently discharged from ___ after presenting 
with tachypnea, constipation and possibly aspiration (see 
below). She was initially doing well at home but on the morning 
of admission, her son noted that she was more lethargic and was 
having trouble clearing her throat. He checked her pulse ox and 
her oxygen sat was 80%. Of note, son reported she had taken a 
Xanax prior to this episode for anxiety. He called EMS and gave

Brief Hospital Course:
# Hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen: 
The etiology of the patient's hypoxia at home is unclear.  Her 
oxygen saturations improved quickly when she reached ___ 
ED and she was on room air when she arrived at ___.  Chest XR 
did now show a pneumonia.  I suspect she was having trouble 
clearing her throat due to lethargy (side-effect from prior 
Xanax use) and had a transient airway obstruction or mucus plug 
as the source of her hypoxia.  While she was in the hospital she 
was continued on her home duonebs, flovent and prednisone.  Her 
son ___ plans to only give her half of a Xanax for anxiety in 
the future.

# Toxic Metabolic Encephalopathy: 
Her altered mental status at the time of admission was likely 
from a combination of medication side-effect (Xanax) as well as 
urinary tract infection.  UA was positive and urine culture grew 
> 100,000 CFU pan sensitive Klebsiella.  She completed a course 
of antibiotics while hospitalized.  Sedating medications were 
used sparingly and son ___ try melatonin for sleep rather 
than a benzodiazepine.  Trazodone was held.  

# Troponinemia:
- Initial troponin at ___ was 0.02.  She was 
transferred to ___ for further evaluation.  Her troponins 
trended 0.02 --> 0.02 --> <0.01.  Her EKG was unchanged from her 
baseline and she did not show any signs of ACS.

# Constipation: Continue senna, Miralax, bisacodyl

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS:
# Anemia: Chronic, stable
# Glaucoma: Continued home eye gtts
# Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued atorvastatin
# Anxiety: Continued alprazolam sparingly as needed
# Insomnia: Substitute melatonin for trazodone at discharge
# GERD: Nexium

Appeal of Discharge: Patient's son ___ appealed his mother's 
discharge.  He had a few concerns as follows.  He wanted his 
mother to complete the course of antibiotics in the hospital.  I 
explained that this was not necessary since we had culture data 
to ensure good response to PO medications.  He wanted his mother 
to have a feeding tube placed.  While this can be considered, 
___ had recently passed a swallow evaluation and had done well 
with her medications and honey thick diet in the hospital.  She 
showed no signs of aspiration.  When I initially discussed a 
feeding tube with ___, she said she did not want one.  I 
advised ___ to discuss this topic further with his PCP and 
___.

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Bedbound.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with altered mental status and decreased 
oxygen levels.  You were likely altered (confused, not acting 
yourself) since you had a urinary tract infection and you had 
taken a sedating medication, Xanax, the night before.  You were 
given an antibiotic to treat your pneumonia. 

You also had low oxygen levels at home.  Since you were confused 
and sleepy, you likely had trouble clearing your mucus 
secretions.  This brief mucus blockage was the likely cause of 
your low oxygen level at home.  You did not show any signs of 
pneumonia and your oxygen levels quickly returned to normal.

At home, please ensure you give yourself adequate time to eat 
your meals.  Please decrease use of sedating medications like 
Xanax or take half a pill of Xanax.  You will follow-up with 
your primary care doctor and ___ as below.

IMAGING/STUDIES
================

CT ABD/PELVIS ___
1. No acute abnormality within the abdomen or pelvis. 
2. Sigmoid diverticulosis, without evidence of acute 
diverticulitis. 
3. Stable compression deformities of the T11, L1, and L2 
vertebral bodies. 

CXR ___
Left basilar atelectasis.  No definite acute cardiopulmonary 
abnormality.

G-TUBE PLACEMENT ___
A 65 cm, 5 ___ glide catheter was negotiated through the 
Nares down to the stomach using a 0.035 glidewire.  Position in 
the stomach was confirmed with injection of air.  The tube was 
then secured and used for insufflation.  A scout image of the 
abdomen was obtained. The stomach was insufflated through the 
indwelling nasogastric tube. Under fluoroscopic guidance, 2 T 
fastener buttons were sequentially deployed elevating the 
stomach to the anterior abdominal wall. Intra-gastric position 
was confirmed with aspiration of air and injection of contrast. 
A 19 gauge needle was introduced under fluoroscopic guidance and 
position confirmed using an injection of dilute contrast. A 
Amplatz wire was introduced into the  stomach. A small skin 
incision was made along the needle and the needle was removed. 
After sequential dilation using 12, 14 in 16 ___ dilators, a 
18 ___  peel-away sheath was placed.  A 14 ___ MIC 
gastrostomy catheter was advanced over the wire into position. 
The catheter was secured by instilling dilute contrast into the 
balloon.  Contrast injection confirmed intragastric  position.  
The catheter was then flushed, capped and secured. Sterile 
dressings were applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well 
and there were no immediate 
complications. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with ___ disease, esophageal dysmotility, dementia 
who presented with hip pain versus abdominal pain, developed 
acute hypoxia while in the ED from aspiration. Admitted to the 
hospital for hypoxia.

#GOALS OF CARE:
#CHRONIC ASPIRATION
#UNINTENTIONAL WEIGHT LOSS
   The patient has oropharyngeal dysphagia due to her advanced 
___ disease and esophageal dysphagia due to her 
esophageal dysmotility. She had been taking a honey-thick diet 
at home (mostly Boost), but had been losing weight despite the 
heroic efforts of her son to encourage oral feedings, and also 
had a clinically overt aspiration event in the ED despite 
texture modification of her diet. She was seen by speech and 
swallow, who felt that even if we thicken food enough to help 
with the oropharyngeal phase of swallow, there is little we can 
do about the esophageal issue; she was recommended for strict 
NPO. 
    Given that the dysphagia is related to issues other than her 
dementia (which is not end-stage), we felt she would be a 
candidate for a feeding tube, if within the goals of care. It 
was difficult to directly understand the patient's own goals - 
there is prior documentation that the patient would refuse a 
feeding tube, and she was able to say in AM on ___ (in front 
of myself, attending MD, RN, and son) that she would not want a 
feeding tube. Since then, she said ""I'm thinking about it"" when 
asked about wanting a feeding tube. It was very difficult to 
interpret patient's wishes in this setting, and as such, we had 
to rely on the patient's son and HCP ___, who is her 
___ caregiver at home. We discussed with him that feeding tubes 
do not eliminate the risk of aspiration, but that it would 
probably be safer than oral feedings and would at least help to 
deliver nutrition more reliably and successfully. After some 
vacillation, he ultimately decided he was strongly in favor of a 
feeding tube.
    As such, interventional radiology was consulted and a PEG 
was successfully placed on ___. Tube feeds initiated on 
___ - pt tolerated well prior to discharge. She will receive 
cycled tube feeds 16 hours per day. She is also continued on her 
home BID PPI (to reduce the acidity of gastric contents should 
she micro-aspirate) and on BID chlorhexidine mouthwash.

#ACUTE HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE:
#REACTIVE AIRWAY DISEASE:
#CHRONIC ASPIRATION RISK:
    Hypoxia resolved over time - ultimately it was attributed to 
aspiration pneumonitis. She is followed by Dr ___ 
pulmonology - she does not have a formal pulmonary diagnosis, as 
she is unable to cooperate for PFTs, but seems to have some mild 
pulmonary fibrosis and some kind of reactive airway disease. No 
symptoms this admission suggestive of exacerbation of reactive 
airway disease. She was continued on all of her home 
inhalers/nebulizers. 

#RIGHT SIDE PAIN:
   Pt had originally presented with pain in R side while 
ambulating - though per prior ___ records, pt is largely 
wheelchair bound and requires a lift at home for transfers, so 
unclear how much she is ambulating. She has no pain on arrival 
to the floor and no pain is elicited on exam. Had CT abd without 
any findings to explain possible RLQ pain. Has had intermittent 
constipation; ensured robust bowel regimen. Clinically felt to 
be consistent with muscle spasms in the setting of PD - treated 
with ibuprofen and acetaminophen.

#HYPERNATREMIA:
   Na 149 on admission, suspect it is due to limited free water 
intake (in the setting of needing nectar-thickened liquids). 
Resolved once started on tube feeds with free water flushes.

#PARKINSONS DISEASE:
   Has progressive ___ disease with associated 
esophageal dysmotility. Continued home carbidopa-levodopa. 
Continued home Hyoscyamine 0.125 mg SL TID:PRN esophageal spasm

#DEMENTIA:
Probably moderate in severity, but hard to assess given her 
difficulty communicating in the setting her advanced PD. Mental 
status at baseline, per son.

#HLD:
Continued home atorvastatin 20mg daily.

#HYPOTHYROIDISM:
Continued home Levothyroxine 25 mcg PO/NG DAILY.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
==================
[] Started on home tube feeds (supplied via ___. Some meds 
have been changed to liquid or crushable formulations.
[] Please note that her son is very involved in her care and 
provides her with excellent (essentially LTAC-level) elder care 
at home. However, his high standards for care quality and his 
granular involvement in details of care can at times interfere 
with care delivery. For any subsequent admissions, please refer 
to ""Team Meeting"" note from ___ for details on agreements 
that have been reached with ___ about boundaries on his intimate 
involvement with his mother's inpatient care.

Discharge Diagnosis:
PRIMARY DIAGNOSES: 
Acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to aspiration

Muscle spasms 
 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or 
wheelchair.

 
Discharge Instructions:
WHY WERE YOU ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL?
- Your oxygen level was low and you were requiring extra oxygen.

WHAT HAPPENED WHILE YOU WERE IN THE HOSPITAL?
- You had multiple episodes of aspiration while you were here; 
ultimately, it was decided that you would have a feeding tube 
placed. You had a G-tube placed and started to receive nutrition 
that way.
- You were seen by our nutritionists and speech/language 
pathologists - it was determined that, due to your risk of 
aspiration, it was not safe for you to eat or drink anything by 
mouth. You should get all of your nutrition and medicines 
through your feeding tube. 
- You were given fluid through an IV.
- Your oxygen level improved and was stable without extra 
oxygen.
- We gave you Tylenol and ibuprofen for the pain in your right 
side.

WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN YOU LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?
- Continue to take all of your medicines as prescribed.
- Continue your nutrition through your feeding tube. We 
recommend that, if you truly want to minimize your risk of 
aspiration, you do not eat or drink anything by mouth. 
- That said... many people sometimes decide to do unsafe things 
that make them happy. If you feel it is important for quality of 
life to accept the risk of taking a few sips of honey-thick 
liquid once in a while, that is not totally unreasonable. People 
want to stay healthy, but they want to be happy too! 
- Please keep all of your appointments, as scheduled.

Imaging:
========
-___ CXR (PA & lateral)
  ""FINDINGS: Patient is kyphotic in position.  Patient's chin
overlies the lung apices, partially obscuring the view.  There
are small bilateral pleural effusions.  No definite focal
consolidation is seen.  There is no evidence pneumothorax. 
Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.  Chronic
bilateral rib deformities are again re-demonstrated.  Bones are
diffusely osteopenic and there is a chronic appearing deformity
at the left shoulder.  Previously seen compression deformities 
of
the spine were better assessed on prior studies. 
   IMPRESSION:  Patient's chin overlies the lung apices,
partially obscuring the view.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
are seen.  No definite focal consolidation. 

-___ CXR (portable):
IMPRESSION: Study is limited as the patient's head obscures the
lung apex on the left. There are very low lung volumes.  There 
is
extensive osteopenia and several old rib fractures bilateral. 
There is coarsening of the bronchovascular markings bilaterally
without overt pulmonary edema or focal consolidation.  No
definite pneumothoraces are identified.  Overall findings are
unchanged.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Presented with reported productive cough, dyspnea, and lethargy. 
Disconcertingly, but consistently, her son, ___ would 
often say that she had a symptom, but when the patient was asked 
how she was feeling or asked specifically about that symptom, 
she would often say she was not feeling that way.

She did have a productive cough, however she did not demonstrate 
dyspnea or lethargy during her hospital course. Her CXR was not 
consistent with PNA. She had no other findings to suggest a 
bacterial infection. It was thought this represented a possible 
exacerbation of her chronic ""reactive airway disease"" which, 
itself, does not seem to have a clear underlying etiology, 
though perhaps may be due to chronic aspiration. She was treated 
with her usual home medications and she did well. No additional 
steroids were given and no antibiotics were given.

Leading up to the time of discharge, the patient's son made 
numerous requests of additional testing in an apparent attempt 
to delay and/or prevent discharge. He made all of these requests 
under the auspices of ""advocating for my mother,"" but many of 
the requests were made repeatedly, and aggressively towards the 
nursing staff, despite clear counseling by the patient's 
physicians that the tests were not necessary and would not be 
performed/repeated. His requests also did not align with the 
patient's clinical condition. On the day prior to discharge and 
the day of discharge, the patient herself noted that she felt 
quite good, was not having shortness of breath, and overall felt 
better than prior to admission. She was not noted to have any 
periods of significant dyspnea that did not respond to her usual 
home nebulizer treatments, and she was not noted to be lethargic 
during her time in the hospital.

We counseled her son that ongoing long-term prednisone use may 
not be advisable in her case.  Specifically, prednisone 
increases her risk of skin injuries (she has some already), 
slowed wound healing, osteoporosis with more fragility fractures 
(she has several already), anxiety (which has been increasingly 
problematic per family), and stomach ulcers (particularly when 
combined with Advil she takes for pain).  We advised that they 
discuss this further with Dr. ___ primary pulmonologist.

___ CXR:
Within limitations of severe chest wall deformity, likely right 
upper lobe 
atelectasis/early infiltrates in the appropriate clinical 
setting.  The lower  lobes on both sides in the left upper lobe 
are clear. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with ___ disease, esophageal dysmotility w/ chronic 
aspirations s/p PEG for feeding, reactive airway disease on 
chronic glucocorticoids, presenting with increased PEG-tube 
residuals, found to have suspected pneumonia and rib fractures 
on CT chest. Patient received treatment for pneumonia and had 
persistent
episodes of hypoxemia due to aspiration from esophageal 
dysmotility, extreme kyphosis and atelectasis, dyskinesias from 
___ disease and underlying lung disease from COPD and
bronchiectasis. The patient was planned for discharge with 
appropriate ___ services and home O2 services, but patient son 
appealed the discharge. The case was reviewed by medicare who 
agreed with the medical team. 

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
#Community acquired pneumonia
Patient has chronic cough with multiple recent admissions for 
increased cough and lethargy (per son's report, but some 
discrepancy w/ clinician observation, per prior notes). Has been 
afebrile, but has a mild lekocytosis, soft BPs, and a lingular 
consolidation on CT. Therefore, treated for CAP. That being 
said, CT changes and low-grade leukocytosis may simply represent 
pneumonitis from chronic aspiration +/- atelectasis. Treated 
with IV ceftriaxone/azithromycin for a total 5 day course 
(___). Persistent O2 requirement discussed below. 

#COPD
#Bronchiectasis 
#Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure 
Patient has been on 10 mg prednisone for some time now. Son 
called her pulmonologist due to perceived increase in WOB and 
respiratory distress and he recommended increasing prednisone to 
40 mg daily (she received 2 doses of 40 mg). On exam, patient 
was mildly tachypneic but without wheezing. Did not start 
prednisone burst, as pt has had well-documented 
prednisone-related side effects, and her respiratory status 
appears stable. She was continued on her home fluticasone, 
ipratropium, levalbuterol, and fomoterol breathing treatments, 
and prednisone 10mg qd. She was given guaifenasin q6h prn. Her 
fluctuations in respiratory function and persistent O2 
requirement despite treatment for CAP and COPD is likely due to 
chronic aspiration from esophageal dysmotility, extreme kyphosis 
and atelectasis, dyskinesias from ___ disease and 
underlying lung disease from COPD and bronchiectasis. The 
patient was discharged with home oxygen. She will have follow up 
with her pulmonologist to determine taper for prednisone. 

#Acute, subacute, and chronic rib fractures
Likely related to osteoporosis (w/ progressive demineralization 
from chronic prednisone use) and chronic cough. Evaluated by 
trauma, who do not recommend any surgical intervention. 

#Esophageal dysmotility
#Tube feed residuals 
Patient had one episode of 300 cc TF residual without any sign 
of clinical obstruction. Informed son that residuals do not need 
be checked regularly. Tube feeds were transitioned to the AM 
hours for 17 hours/day given family concern for aspirations from 
tube feeds. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
___ Disease 
Continued home carbidopa-levodopa

DISCHARGE APPEAL
================
  Repeated discussions with ___ (Son-HCP) were held 
regarding the poor prognosis for ___.  She is prone to 
aspirations, recurrent hypoxia with repeated mucous plugging.  
Given her Parksinson's, esophageal dysmotility, kyphosis and 
deconditioning, little can be done to prevent these aspirations 
from recurring.  She already has a PEG tube in place.  Despite 
efforts to impart the fact that providing ongoing care may 
actually be counterproductive, he did not appear willing to 
listen and insisted that everything should be done.  
   He appealed the discharge to Medicare - and the decision was 
made in agreement with our assessment.  She was discharged home 
with added oxygen, suctioning equipment and followup.  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================

[] Pulmonology: will work on tapering prednisone.
[] Neurology: continue to optimize sinemet. After receiving 
sinemet, patient is having significant dyskinesias exacerbating 
oxygen desaturations. 
[] Patient has a suction machine to help clear her secretions. 
The patient will need to have a renewed script to resupply the 
machine versus obtain a new machine. 
[] Patient was discharged with home oxygen. Continue to reassess 
need for oxygen.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:
========
Ms. ___ is ___ female with past medical history of 
___ disease, advanced dementia, esophageal dysmotility 
w/ chronic aspirations s/p PEG for feeding, reactive airway 
disease on chronic glucocorticoids who presented with increased 
work of breathing and increased cough with sputum/secretions, 
found to have acute hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure, 
MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia, frequent bradycardia, and 
hypotension. 

ACUTE ISSUES 
=============== 
# Acute hypoxemic hypercarbic respiratory failure 
Initially presenting with hypoxia. Her respiratory failure 
worsened and was started on HFNC and eventually was intubated on 
___ after goals of care discussions with the family. She was 
given aggressive pulmonary toilet. Attempts to wean the 
ventilator were not successful, so she ultimately underwent 
tracheostomy placement and bronchoscopy on ___. Patient 
continued to have intermittent low minute ventilation so 
required switching from pressure support to volume control. She 
will need ongoing ventilator weaning after discharge. 

# Sepsis secondary to HAP
# MRSA pneumonia
# Pseudomonas PNA
CXR demonstrated findings concerning for multifocal pneumonia. 
Her sputum grew MRSA and Pseudomonas. For her MRSA pneumonia, 
she was given 10 days of vancomycin. For her Pseudomonas 
infection, she was initially treated with cefepime, but 
ultimately transitioned to IV ciprofloxacin for an additional 7 
days after her Pseudomonas developed intermediate sensitivities 
to cefepime. Last day of ciprofloxacin is ___. 

# Hypotension
Requiring pressors after being intubated. Likely ___ sedatives 
and sepsis. Given norepi for goal MAP >65. She did 
intermittently have brief hypotensive episodes throughout 
hospitalization that were fluid responsive. There may have been 
a component of difficulty measuring BPs given frequent 
movements. 

# Reactive airway disease/COPD
# Chronic aspiration
Patient has been on long-standing prednisone. Concern for 
chronic aspiration in the setting of esophageal dysmotility with 
kyphosis and dyskinesias from ___. Given high dose 
prednisone (50 mg) for 5 days followed by taper in addition to 
aggressive nebulizer regimen. She will be maintained on her home 
prednisone dose of 10 mg PO daily afterwards. 

# Recurrent episodes of bradycardia 
Before intubation, patient would intermittently have bradycardic 
episodes including a 10-second pause on telemetry in the setting 
of hypoxia and discomfort. Electrophysiology was consulted who 
did not feel that this regard prior to pacemaker placement. 
These episodes did not recur after intubation. Likely related to 
vagal episodes. 

# Coag negative staph in blood cultures 
Grown in one set of cultures, thought to be ___ contamination. 

# Diarrhea
C. diff negative. Likely ___ tube feeds. 

# Skin excoriations in groin
Foley placed for skin breakdown on external genitalia ___ 
urinary incontinence. 

# Hypernatremia
Likely ___ poor PO intake. Resolved with increased free water 
flushes. 

# Anemia
# Thrombocytopenia
Likely secondary to sepsis and antibiotics. Improved with 
treatment of infections. 

CHRONIC PROBLEMS:
=================
# Subacute and chronic rib fractures
Found on prior admission and thought to be due to chronic cough 
and osteoporosis. Continued Tylenol, ibuprofen and lidocaine 
patches. 

# ___ Disease
# Advanced dementia
Continued home carbidopa-levodopa and carbidopa. 

# Esophageal dysmotility
Continued tube feeds through PEG

# HLD
Continued home atorvastatin daily 

# GERD
Continued home lansoprazole 30 mg PO BID 

# Hypothyroidism
Continued home levothyroxine 25 mcg daily 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[] Continue IV ciprofloxacin to end on ___
[] Please attempt to wean ventilator support 
[] Continue goals of care discussions if unable to be weaned 
from ventilator 
[] Please remove foley and attempt voiding trial
[] Pseudomonas developed resistance to cefepime, ceftazadime, 
and piperacillin-tazobactam. Please avoid use of these 
antibiotics in the future if concern for pneumonia
[] Prednisone taper
___: 20 mg x2 days
___: 10 mg PO daily indefinitely

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,  

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___!  

Why was I admitted to the hospital?  
=================================
- You were admitted because you were having difficulty breathing 
and were found to have a pneumonia.

What happened while I was in the hospital?  
====================================
- You had testing done to figure out what kind of pneumonia you 
had.  This showed you had 2 infections call MRSA and 
Pseudomonas.
 You were given IV antibiotics to treat these infections.
 You were given higher dose prednisone to help with 
inflammation in your lungs. 
 We placed you on a breathing machine called a ventilator to 
help you breath. Because you could not breathe without this 
machine, a tracheostomy (breathing tube in the neck) was placed, 
which will help you to breathe with the support of the 
ventilator, but be more comfortable. 

What should I do after leaving the hospital?  
============================================
- Please take your medications as listed in discharge summary 
and follow up at the listed appointments. 

Thank you for allowing us to be involved in your care, we wish 
you all the best!

hypothyroidism, and recent admission for MRSA and pseudomonas
PNA, which resulted in trach/peg, now with vent dependence, who
now presents from her rehab (___) with fevers despite 
multiple
courses of antibiotics.

Since her last discharge for MRSA and pseudomonas (with 
inducible
resistance to cefepime and ceftaz) PNA, she has been on
antibiotics for resistant organisms for all but ~5 days. She has
been followed by ID while at ___, and while there, was
on vanc/cipro -> bactrim/meropenem (for stenotrophomonas and
pseudomonas) -> vancomycin/ceftaz-avibactam. She was scheduled 
to
continue Vancomycin and ceftaz/avibactam until ___ but
continued to spike fevers as high as ___, so she was sent to
___ for further evaluation per the son's request. Patient is
non-verbal and unable to provide meaningful history or ROS. She
is confirmed full code.

Of note, according to a progress note from ___ on ___
the son has been verbally abusive and yelling at staff 
requesting
that ""full investigation of all patient's current medical
problems and maximal support."" 

In the ED, 

Initial Vitals: T 99.7, HR 96, BP 176/86, RR 20 on vent.

Exam: Chronically ill appearing, frail, appears uncomfortable.
Trach midline, no surrounding erythema or drainage. Diminished

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old woman with history of advanced ___, 
bilateral blindness, reactive airway disease on chronic 
prednisone, HTN, HLD, COPD, hypothyroidism, and recent admission 
for MRSA and pseudomonas PNA, which resulted in trach/peg, now 
with vent dependence, who now presents from her rehab (___) 
with persistent fevers and leukocytosis despite broad spectrum 
ABX for PNA, found to have bilateral UE DVT. Fevers likely 
non-infectious, so antibiotics discontinued. Patient stable and 
discharged back to ___. 

ACUTE ISSUES 
=============== 
# Fevers
Patient presents from ___ with persistent fevers and 
mild leukocytosis despite broad spectrum coverage for her 
resistant PNAs. ID was consulted and felt that her culture data 
likely reflects colonization, given her non-inflammatory sputum 
studies, stable vent settings, and stable secretions. The most 
likely etiology of her fevers is non infectious such as drug 
fever or ___ DVT. Notably, she was found to
have RUE DVT of brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins of the 
RUE. She was also found to have LUE DVT of axillary veins (with 
PICC still in place). It is possible this could be contributing 
to her fevers. Less likely new or persistent bacterial 
infection, though viral infection could be considered. Flu neg. 

# Bilateral UE Catheter Associated DVT:
Patient presented with RUE edema, found to have RUE thrombi of 
the brachial (non-occlusive), cephalic (occlusive), and basilic 
(non-occlusive) veins. This occurred in the setting of RUE PICC 
placed in the R basilic vein last admission (subsequently 
removed). She was also found to have partially occlusive LUE 
thrombi within the axillary (deep) and proximal basilic veins, 
with PICC still in place due to necessity of frequent lab draws. 
After extensive conversation with the patient's son (HCP) re: 
risks and benefits of anticoagulation, it was ultimately decided 
to anticoagulate with warfarin, with lovneox bridge. She will 
need repeat ultrasounds to assess for clot resolution on 
anticoagulation, minimum planned duration 3 months. Will also 
need to monitor for e/o active bleeding.

# L UE Erythema
The patient was found to have L upper arm erythema in the 
setting of L UE DVT, with some excoriations of the skin. Given 
improvement with topical emollients and without antibiotics, 
this was thought to be excoriation in the setting of her chronic 
steroid use, and less likely an overlying cellulitis. This 
should continue to be monitored at ___.

# Chronic Hypoxic respiratory failure: 
The patient is trached and vent dependent in the setting of 
advanced dementia. Her Trach cuff pressures were within normal 
limits(28). She was continued on her outpatient ventilator 
settings of CMV overnight and PSV during day. Trach sputum 
cultures grew pseudomonas, but given low PMNs and scant sputum 
production with stable vent settings, suspect colonization as 
opposed to active infection.

# Normocytic Anemia
The patient has a recent baseline Hgb of 7.5-8.5, and has 
required 2u PRBC while at
___. Did have guaiac + stools there, though no evidence of 
overt bleeding. Could represent a slow GIB vs marrow suppression 
in the setting of recent infections. s/p 1UPRBC with robust 
response supporting that acute bleed is less likely. Iron 
studies suggest anemia of chronic inflammation.

CHRONIC ISSUES 
=============== 
# Esophageal dysmotility: s/p PEG: The patient was continued on 
nutrition's final tube feed recs from her last admission

# ___: Continued home carbidopa/levodopa regimen

# HLD: Continued home statin

# Chronic pain: Continued APAP. Home NSAIDs were held in the 
setting of anemia. 

# Reactive airway disease, copd: Continued home prednisone 10mg 
daily and home inhalers

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[]will need ___ weekly INR checks and CBCs to monitor blood 
counts on anticoagulation for catheter associated DVT of 
bilateral UE
--- Discharge Hgb 7.5

[]started warfarin for bilateral UE catheter associated DVT, 
planning to bridge with lovenox. Continue to assess risks and 
benefits of anticoagulation at ___.

[]L UE PICC was left in given anticipated need for serial lab 
draws with challenging venous access

[]Repeat bilateral UE U/S in 1 month (___) to evaluate RUE 
DVT and LUE DVT to determine needed duration of anticoagulation. 
Anticipated duration of anticoagulation is 3 months, but will 
potentially need longer given PICC left in place.

[]Avoid BP cuffs in UE iso DVT. The patient's son requests that 
all BPs be taken in the left leg just below the knee.

[]f/u blood cultures ___: No growth to date at time of 
discharge

[]holding home NSAIDS in the setting of anemia

[]for pain control, the patient's son prefers 1.25mg oxycodone 
PRN for pain. The patient did respond well to small (0.125mg) IV 
dilaudid boluses. Could consider supplementing with IV dilaudid 
PRN for pain control.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a privilege taking care of you at ___ 
___.  

WHY WAS I ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL?
===================================
- You were admitted to the hospital because you were found to 
have fevers at your rehab. 

WHAT HAPPENED WHILE I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL?
==========================================
- There was a concern that you had pneumonia and you were 
continued on antibiotics. However your symptoms appeared to be 
unlikely from an infection and your antibiotics were stopped. 
- You had an ultrasound of your arm which showed blood clots. It 
is possible that these blood clots were causing your fevers. We 
discussed the risks and benefits of starting a blood thinner 
with your family, and we ultimately chose to start a blood 
thinner.
- You had low blood counts and needed a blood transfusion. Your 
blood counts improved.   

WHAT SHOULD I DO AFTER I LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?
============================================  
- Please continue to take all your medications and follow up 
with your doctors at your ___ appointments.  
- Your blood counts will need to be monitored closely in the 
setting of your new blood thinner. You will also need a repeat 
ultrasound of your arms in the future to look for interval 
change in the clots.

We wish you all the best!

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  
===========================  
___ with h/o advanced ___, dementia, blindness, HTN, 
HLD,
COPD, hypothyroidism, who is now ___ dependent after
pseudomonas pneumonia presents to the ED with c/o respiratory
distress. She was discharged from rehab yesterday. ___ reports
that she had been doing well at ___. About ___ weeks ago she
had a pneumonia that was treated w/ antibiotics he is unsure 
what
kind. He notes increased upper airway sounds especially when she
is on a trach mask. He had requested a CXR at ___ but they did
not do one. He says she had no oral temperatures there. He says
she has been doing well and continues to communicate when there
they create a leak in her trach. Additionally she raises her
right hand with issues. Lately she has been raising her right
hand with concerns when he asks her. Lately it has been with 
pain
in her back. 

She came home to her son yesterday. He noted that she has had
intermittent episodes of having respiratory rates of ___ and
then it will go up to 30 for a few seconds and back down. He is
concerned this is new for her and he talked to a respiratory
therapist who he has on call who recommended she get evaluated. 

While at OSH she had episodes of tachypnea. CXR was c/f
persistent pneumonia with lactate 2.2. She was given a dose of
Vancomycin and Cefepime and transferred to ___.

Of note the patient had persistent fevers in the past despite
broad spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia. ID has been consulted
in the past and felt that she likely has colonization. They
believe she likely had fevers due to non-infectious source or
drug fever. She had a DVT in her RUE brachial, basilica and
cephalic veins. She also had LUE DVT of the axillary. The
decision last admission, despite many risks was to
anticoagulation with warfarin with a lovenox bridge. She was to
get 3 weeks of anticoagulation as she had a PICC in place. She
remained vent dependent previously. 

In the ED she had a fever to 101.4. She had a HR of 81, RR 14.
She was on her home ventilator settings of CMV, 400/10/5/28%. 

Her exam showed bilateral rhonchi, no sores appreciated or other
abnormalities.   

Lab work up showed a VBG 7.46/45. Lactate 1.3. WBC 8.0 
Hemoglobin
9.4. Remaining lab work was pending at time of transfer. Lactate
2.2 at OSH vanc and Cefepime given at OSH. Started on NS. 

ROS: Positives as per HPI; otherwise negative.

Brief Hospital Course:
PATIENT SUMMARY
===================
Ms ___ is a ___ year old woman with history of advanced 
___, bilateral blindness, reactive airway disease on 
chronic prednisone, HTN, HLD, COPD, hypothyroidism, and recent 
admission for MRSA and pseudomonas PNA which resulted in 
___, now with vent dependence (___), who now 
presents from her home w/ tachypnea (intermittent) found on last 
admission to have bl UE DVT (transitioned to warfarin). She has 
no leukocytosis on admission and no further fevers over one in 
ED. Staph coag negative at ___ and ___ culture, likely both 
contaminants.

ACUTE ISSUES 
=============== 
# Fever (noted x 1)
Most likely still colonized as noted before. Contaminated sputum 
here, CXR w/o PNA. No leukocytosis and maintains baseline 
tachypnea per prior providers. She finished her last course of 
antibiotics ___ weeks ago at ___. White count stable, no 
tachycardia. Afebrile other than 1 ED rectal temperature. One 
blood culuture at OSH and one blood culture at ___ with staph 
epi (one at OSH, one ___, but stable, thus thought to both be 
contaminants). 

#Chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure
#Trach dependent
Gas on admission reassuring. Continued home settings on trach, 
weaned as tolerated. She transitioned to trach mask, and 
intermittently used the ventilator if she appeared to be in 
respiratory distress. However this was weaned throughout her 
stay, and she was stably maintained on trach mask before 
discharge, with oxygen saturations 98-100% on 35% FiO2 and no 
respiratory distress. She did not need mechanical ventilation 
for 36 hours prior to discharge. 

# Bilateral UE Catheter Associated DVT:
Diagnosed previous admission ___ - ___. Repeat 
ultrasound here showed no evdience of DVT in upper extremity 
veins in setting of Warfarin since discharge in ___. Plan to 
continue anticoag until end of ___ with warfarin goal INR ___, 
with consideration of transitioning to enoxaparin ___omplete for lifelong anticoagulation, as she has a 
propensity to develop venothromboemboli. 

# Normocytic anemia
The patient has a recent baseline Hgb of 7.5-8.5m/dL. Iron 
studies from her last admission suggest anemia of chronic 
inflammation. She requires intermittent transfusions. 

# Severe protein-calorie malnutrition
She was continued on tube feeds per recommendation of the 
Nutrition service. 

CHRONIC ISSUES 
=============== 
# Esophageal dysmotility: s/p ___: The patient was continued on 
the Nutrition service's final tube feed recs from her last 
admission

# ___: Continued home carbidopa/levodopa regimen 
(adjusted while at ___)

# HLD: Continued home statin

# Chronic pain: We transitioned standing acetaminophen to PRN as 
she did not appear in pain, and nodded no when asked if she was 
in any pain. Home NSAIDs were held in the setting of anemia. She 
should continue on as-needed pain control with acetaminophen or 
very low dose oxycodone. 

# Reactive airway disease, copd: Taper prednisone as below in 
transitional issues

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[] if patient to go home in future, continue trach/vent teaching 
w/ son
[] continue on going discussions w/ family regarding prognosis 
and goals of care
[] Please discuss with family long-term anticoagulation given 
propensity for venous thromboembolism. 
[] Patient does well on trach mask, only needs ventilator if o2 
sat decreases or she appears in respiratory distress. 
[] prednisone taper as follows: 5 mg PO daily until ___, 2.5 mg 
starting ___ through ___, then stop prednisone. 
Re-evaluate need if symptoms worsen off of prednisone. 

Code: Full, confirmed w/ Son (___), Proxy ___

This patient was prescribed, or continued on, an opioid pain 
medication at the time of discharge (please see the attached 
medication list for details). As part of our safe opioid 
prescribing process, all patients are provided with an opioid 
risks and treatment resource education sheet and encouraged to 
discuss this therapy with their outpatient providers to 
determine if opioid pain medication is still indicated.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ female with advanced ___, 
chronic respiratory failure s/p trach, chronic aspiration with 
PEG, dementia, hypertension, hyperlipidemia who is presenting 
with distal fibula (?tibial as well) fracture and found to have 
concerns for UTI in the ED. She was admitted to the ICU given 
chronic respiratory failure and brief hypotension in the ED 
which responded to IVF.

#Comminuted distal fibula fracture
Presenting with distal fibula fracture after having trauma on
stationary bike. She was initially placed in a right lower 
extremity splint, which was subsequently casted by the 
orthopedics service. She received her home acetaminophen dose 
and oxycodone as needed for pain control. She has follow-up 
scheduled with orthopedics. 

#Hypotension, improved
Patient was briefly hypotensive in the ED with SBPs in the ___, 
Improved with 1L NS. Lactate within normal limits. Etiology 
likely either hypovolemia vs. sepsis. Given hyponatremia, 
possibly related to hypovolemia, especially given rapid 
improvement after small amount of IVF. Some concerns for UTI as 
noted below. 

#UTI
Patient found to have pyuria on UA in setting of leukocytosis. 
No other clear source of infection. She was given a 7 day course 
of ceftriaxone as treatment for urinary tract infection which 
was then transitioned to Keflex. 

#Chronic respiratory failure 
Respiratory status appears at baseline, patient has a 
tracheostomy. CXR without evidence of consolidation. Home 
settings on trach were continued with trach mask during the day 
and ventilator at night, and her home medications were 
continued. 

___: Her home carbidopa/levodopa regimen was continued. 
She had some episodes of agitation overnight and her outpatient 
neurologist Dr. ___ was consulted, who recommended an 
additional 1.5 tabs of Sinamet as needed at 3 am for agitation. 
This was noted to improve her agitation overnight. 

#Bradycardia: While in the ICU, the patient had intermittent 
episodes of sinus bradycardia overnight in the setting of being 
off the ventilator and while episodes of agitation. EKG showed 
no evidence of bundle branch block or heart block. This was 
thought to be secondary to the vasovagal episodes given timing 
with episodes of agitation as well as being off the ventilator. 
She did not have any hypotension during these episodes and 
continued to be monitored throughout her stay.  Her son, ___, 
expressed interest in a cardiology evaluation for which we 
provided him the contact information to schedule an outpatient 
appointment as her bradycardia resolved with improvement in 
agitation and pain control.

___, there were no definite signs of pneumonia and there were 
no clinical indications of acute systemic inflammation or 
infection. She remained on her home ventilator settings at night 
and trach mask during the day. Although very broad spectrum 
antibiotics were provided on presentation in the ED, given the 
absence of infection on chest imaging and the lack of clinical 
symptoms of an acute infection, all antibiotics were stopped 
upon ICU admission, and she was monitored off of antibiotics for 
24 hours without any signs of clinical instability. She was 
subsequently discharged home without antibiotics.

ACUTE ISSUES 
============
# Concern for right upper lobe pneumonia (without radiographic 
or clinical evidence of right upper lobe pneumonia) 
# Chronic respiratory failure 
Ms. ___ has a tracheostomy tube in place in the setting of 
chronic respiratory failure, and requires ventilator support at 
night. During the day, she uses a humidifier with 3L of 
supplemental oxygen. Per history provided by her son (who is her 
primary caregiver at home), Ms. ___ has had increased 
secretions over the last week and an out-patient chest x-ray on 
___ was concerning for potential right upper lobe pneumonia. 
However, on presentation to ___, there was no compelling 
radiographic or clinical evidence of pneumonia. Blood cultures 
and a MRSA screen were negative. She specifically had minimal 
secretions on tracheal suctioning, no leukocytosis on her 
complete blood counts, no fever, no hypotension, no tachycardia, 
and no radiographic evidence of pneumonia (although her lung 
apices were not well visualized on chest x-ray to 
kyphoscoliosis). Ms. ___ was continued on her home 
ipratropium and levalbuterol nebuliizer treatemetns, and 
fomoterol(home med). Her ventilator settings should remain at RR 
___, PEEP 5, TV 300 (reduced from 400cc at home, given her 
height and predicted tidal volume), and FiO2 30%

# History of UTIs
In the ED, the patient did not urinate but on the floor she has 
been incontinent of urine. She has a history of UTIs, and during 
a recent prior hospitalizations, on ___ she grew Klebsiella 
and was appropriately treated. She had another UTI while at home 
prior to this hospitalization which was treated empirically with 
cephalexin and then switched to Bactrim. Urinalysis here ___ 
was without evidence of acute cystitis, and while there was 
initial concern for urinary retention she began to void 
spontaneously prior to discharge, and did not have any more 
issues with retention while inpatient.

# ___ disease 
# Dementia
During her last admission, Ms. ___ had some episodes of 
agitation overnight and her outpatient neurologist Dr. ___ 
___ was consulted. At that time, he recommended an additional 
1.5 tabs of Sinamet as needed at 3AM for agitation. During that 
prior hospitalization, this medication change was noted to 
improve her agitation overnight. Her son says that she 
communicates with him, is normally oriented to person and place, 
and can speak with Passy-Muir valve. We continued Sinamet at her 
home doses this admission.

CHRONIC ISSUES 
==============
#B/l UE catheter associated DVT
She had bilateral upper extremity DVTs diagnosed in ___, 
with repeat US in ___ showing no evidence of DVT. Now that she 
has been treated for more than six months, she remains on 
enoxaparin prophylaxis, which we continued during this 
hospitalization (and on discharge). 

#Hypothyroidism: We continued her home levothyroxine. 

#Esophageal dysmotility: s/p PEG: We continued the Nutrition 
service's final tube feed recommendations from her last 
admission. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[] Follow up on respiratory secretions and respiratory status 
off of antibiotics
[] Continue to monitor for signs of urinary retention, consider 
outpatient urodynamic studies if persistently retaining.
[] Ventilator settings at discharge: RR 13, TV 300, PEEP 5, FiO2 
30%

IMAGING
========
___ CXR
Evaluation is limited due to low lung volumes and patient 
positioning with chin overlying the lung apices. Within these 
limitations: 
Tracheostomy is again seen. No large pleural effusion or obvious 
pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged and 
stable. Aortic arch atherosclerotic calcifications are again 
seen.  Obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm may be secondary to 
atelectasis, a developing infiltrate cannot be excluded. 
The apparent opacity in the right lower lung base is not 
visualized on repeat images and is likely due to overlying soft 
tissue, possibly the patient's arm. Deformities of the bilateral 
ribs, may be related to old fractures.

___ year old woman with chronic respiratory failure s/p PEG/trach 
___ (nocturnally ventilated), chronic aspiration with PEG, 
dementia, advanced ___, HTN, HLD, and recent admission 
for a right fibula fracture, who presents with hypotension and 
diarrhea in the setting of C diff infection and UTI. Her 
hypotension was likely hypovolemic and rapidly improved with IV 
fluid resuscitation. She was treated with high-dose PO 
vancomycin and IV flagyl as well as IV ceftriaxone for her GNR 
UTI. Upon discharge, the patient was clinically improved with 
baseline blood pressures and decreased stool output.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
====================
[] Patient to complete PO vancomycin on ___ for total course 
of 14 days. Please ensure diarrhea has resolved following 
completion of this
[] Patient initiated on treatment for UTI and will be discharged 
with bactrim for 1 day for total 3 day course. Please ensure 
completion and resolution of UTI following this
[] Would recommend prophylactic PO vancomycin with future 
antibiotic courses to prevent recurrent C. diff

ACUTE ISSUES 
======================= 
# Diarrhea
# C difficile Infection
Patient presented with diarrhea over the past week unresponsive 
to PO vanc in the setting of known C diff infection. Although 
the number of daily stools has slowed down, the volume of the 
stools have been large. Given that she has had multiple c diff 
infections, she may be resistant to vancomycin. Stool cultures 
were sent. She was started on high dose PO vancomycin and IV 
flagyl. She was given IV fluids as below for GI losses. Her 
stool output decreased, her hypotension resolves, and she 
overall clinically was stable.

# Hypotension
Patient has blood pressures as low as ___ systolic in ED. BP was 
very responsive to fluid with no need for pressors. This was 
likely due to hypovolemia in the setting of fluid loss from 
diarrhea. Possibly, a compenent of SIRS response with C diff 
infection and UTI. No evidence of end organ damage based on 
initial labs. Blood pressures on discharge back to baseline.

# UTI
Patient with urine culture growing >100K GNR bacteria. The team 
was unable to assess symptoms given her mental status. 
Therefore, given concern for sepsis, she was treated with IV 
ceftriaxone.

# Chronic respiratory failure 
Patient has a tracheostomy and requires ventilator support at 
night. Patient has a history of frequent aspirations, with CXR 
appearing similar to baseline. She was continued on home 
ventilator settings. she was continued on home ipratropium, 
levalbuterol, and Perforomist.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Bronchitis vs airway reactivity after infection
___ disease
 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker 
or cane).

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for occasional wheezing and cough. There was 
concern for pneumonia but your chest X-ray did not show 
pneumonia and your symptoms quickly improved with nebulizers. 
Antibiotics were stopped and you tolerated this just fine. 
Overall, your presentation is most consistent with a post 
infectious bronchitis or asthma like syndrome.

You were evaluated by speech and language pathology who felt you 
would benefit from a ground diet with thin liquids to minimize 
your risks of accidentally inhaling some of your food when you 
eat (which can predispose to pneumonia and coughing fits).

You were deconditioned and had difficulty moving around and 
physical therapy recommended going to a rehab facility. You did 
not qualify for acute level rehab and so you and your family 
elected to go home with maximal services in order to work on 
getting stronger at home.

History of Present Illness:
___ year old woman with a history of ___ disease, 
bilateral blindness, HTN, and bronchitis, discharged from ___ 
on ___ after a treatment for airway reactivity, presenting 
after a fall and head strike without LOC at home. 

The patient was sleeping in a recliner at home where she lives 
with her son. She was sleeping in her recliner and suddenly 
startled and noted by her son to have a jerking motion, and 
found to be sliding out of her chair. She eventually lowered 
onto her right knee, and struck her right forehead on the wood 
floor, son unable to cath her. The patient denies any LOC, 
headache, and per her son the patient was at her baseline mental 
status with normal behavior. She was noted to be ambulatory 
after this fall and headstrike, and used her walker to go to 
EMS. Her son notes that she had an episode of emesis in the 
ambulance.

She was recently admitted from ___ with unresolved cough 
and SOB despite outpatient treatment with doxycycline after 
being diagnosed with pneumonia at an OSH. She was treated for 
bronchitis vs. airway reactivity after infection with atrovent, 
fluticasone and albuterol. There was no evidence of pneumonia on 
CXR, and there was low suspicion for bacterial process. She was 
noted to have difficulty ambulating during the admission, and ___ 
recommended rehab, but the patient and family were only 
interested in ___ rehab where she had been before, but the 
patient was declined and went home with services. 

In the ED, initial vitals were: T 96.8 HR 85 BP 138/81 RR 16 96 
RA. ED exam notable for bibasilar crackles, stable pelvis and 
___ strength in UE and LUE. Labs were notable for H/H 11.2/33.7, 
PTT 72.5, INR 1.1, Na 130, cl 95 Cr 0.7. 

The patient underwent extensive imaging in the ED. CT C spine 
was negative for acute fracture or hemorrhage. CT Head was 
negative for acute intracranial pathology. Pelvis XR, B/L Knee 
XR, L ankle XR negative for fracture. Initial CXR negative for 
acute intrathoracic pathology. 

While in the ED, the patient began to have labored respiration 
requiring O2 by NC. Per son had similar jerking movements with 
startling. Concern for aspiration as labored respriations 
occurred after patient eating meds with applesauce. Repeat CXR 
was stable. She was treated with NS and nebulizers. Her 
pressures were in the low ___ while sleeping, but after 
nebulizer treatment and sitting up her pressures were in the 
100s/70s. VBG 7.41/43/49/28, and lactate 1.8

Overall the patient received 500 ml NS, ipatroprium bromide neb 
x3, albuterol neb x2, fluticasone IH x 2,  1 g acetaminophen x2, 
carbidopa levodopa (___) 1.5 tabs, carbidopa 25 mg and 
rasagiline. 

She was admitted given her frailty, respiratory distress and 
intermittent hypoxia in the ED. Vitals on transfer were 98.7 HR 
89 BP 113/89 BP 113/99 RR 19 95 RA.

On the floor, the patient denies any shortness of breath, chest 
pain, abdominal pain, head pain, headache. Breathing is overall 
comfortable. Does endorse being tired. She has no other acute 
concerns as this time.

1. No acute fracture identified. 
2. Severe cervical spondylosis with mild anterolisthesis of C2 
on C3 and C7 on 
T1.  Mild to moderate central canal narrowing without ___ 
stenosis. 
3. Anterior compression deformity of the T3 vertebral body is 
unchanged. 

CT Head ___

KNEE (AP, LAT AND OBLIQUE) BILATERAL  ___  
No fracture.  Prominent osteoporosis 

CHEST (SINGLE VIEW)  ___
No acute intrathoracic abnormality.  Consider dedicated spine 
imaging if there is clinical concern for thoracic spinal 
fracture.
 
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) ___
Overall stable examination of the chest.

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW  ___spiration.

CHEST (PA & LAT) ___
The aorta is markedly unfolded and tortuous.  Heart remains 
upper limits of normal in size.  There is bilateral interstitial 
prominence which is not significantly changed since ___ and likely reflects underlying interstitial lung disease 
rather than interstitial edema.  The patient's mandible obscures 
the apices.  No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  No focal 
airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is an ___ year old woman with a history of 
___ disease, bilateral blindness, HTN, presenting after 
a fall and head strike without LOC at home, admitted with 
respiratory distress and hypoxia in the ED with rapid 
resolution. 

# Mechanical Fall:
Patient discharged on the same day as re presentation to the ED. 
On previous admission, patient noted by ___ to be at high fall 
risk and recommended acute rehab however son declined as pt not 
accepted to first choice rehab. Patient admitted after fall from 
chair, most likely mechanical in etiology, as he patient was 
startled and slipped to the ground and in the setting of her 
weakness and ___ was unable to stop he fall. There was 
no loss of consciousness to suggest syncope as the etiology.  
Overall picture not consistent with seizure activity, as there 
was no post ictal period, also no elevation in lactate noted on 
labs, and the patient ambulated after the event with the use of 
a walker. Imaging including CT C spine, CT Head, CXR, Pelvis XR, 
bilateral knee XR and L ankle XR without fracture or acute 
pathology. There were no focal neuro signs on exam. ___ was 
consulted who recommended disposition to rehab. She was 
discharged to ___.

# Respiratory distress/Aspiration
While in the ED the patient developed respiratory 
distress/labored respirations requiring NC. The etiology was 
concerning for aspiration as she had been eating her medications 
with applesauce prior to the event. A repeat CXR in the ED was 
negative for aspiration, but may have been premature to 
visualize any changes. The differential also included airway 
reactivity, given the recent admission for reactive airways. She 
was quickly weaned to room air with nebulizer treatments. Given 
the concern for mild respiratory distress a third CXR was done 
on the floor, again without any signs of infiltrate or acute 
pathology. There was evidence of mild volume overload and pt 
received 10mg IV lasix. On the previous admission the patient 
was evaluated by SLP who recommended a diet of ground solids and 
thin liquids. SLP was re consulted this admission, and the 
patient underwent a video swallow due to concerns for bedside 
aspiration, which revealed penetration and trace aspiration, and 
the patient was initiated on a diet of ground solids and nectar 
thickened liquids. She was also seen by nutrition who 
recommended supplementation with ensure plus TID. She was 
continued on atrovent and albuterol nebulizer treatmens, and 
fluticasone inhaler. Of note, albuterol was used cautiously as 
caused pt to become tachycardiac.

# Hyponatremia - RESOLVED
Patient with new mild hyponatremia to 130, with concomitant 
hypochloremia. Likely secondary to hypovolemia given improvement 
with IVF. 
 
# Coagulopathy Elevated PTT - RESOLVED
Patient with newly elevated PTT on admission. On recent 
admission patient appears to have been on heparin 5000 U TID, 
though patient is of normal BMI, likely the etioloy of the 
elevated PTT. No concomitant elevation in INR, no 
thrombocytopenia to suggest DIC. No history of elevated PTT in 
the past to suggest the presence of an acquired or intrinsic 
inhibitor. Resolved with holding subC heparin. The patient was 
restarted on subC heparin for VTE prophylaxis with BID dosing 
without elevation in PTT

CHRONIC ISSUES
===============
# ___ disease: Stable. The patient was continued on home 
rasagiline, ___ and carbidopa dosing.

# Hypertension: Stable. The patient continued home metoprolol 
succinate 12.5 mg daily.

# Hyperlipidemia: Stable. The patient continued home 
atorvastatin.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

It was a pleasure caring for you during your stay at ___. You 
were admitted to the hospital after a fall at home. Imaging of 
your head, neck, chest, pelvis, knees and ankle did not reveal 
any signs of fracture or bleeding. In the ED you had some 
shortness of breath and were admitted to the hospital. Your 
breathing improved rapidly with breathing treatments, and you 
were feeling much better by discharge. You had chest x rays 
which did not show any infection or fluid in your lungs. 

You had a video swallow study done, and the speech and language 
pathology experts recommended that you continue on a diet of 
ground foods and nectar thickened liquids to help prevent 
inhaling food when you eat (which can predispose you to 
infection)

You were evaluated by physical therapy and there were signs that 
you were deconditioned and had difficulty moving. They 
recommended that you go to a rehab facility.

Your updated medication list is included in your discharge 
paperwork. You will need to follow up with your primary care 
doctor within 1 week of discharge.

We Wish You The Best!

Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you during your recent admission at 
___.  You presented with wheezing, and it was thought likely 
that you have bronchitis.  You were continued on high-dose 
steroids, nebulizers and an antibiotic called doxycycline.  You 
improved shortly after admission.

Please discuss the 8-pound weight loss you have experienced over 
the last year with your primary care doctor.  We recommend that 
you take three Ensure supplements per day to help increase your 
calorie intake.

It is important that you take all medications as prescribed and 
follow up with any appointments listed below.

Good luck!

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ right-handed man with history
notable for apical variant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, HTN c/b
CKD, pituitary microadenoma c/b hyperprolactinemia, and
hypothyroidism presenting with a transient episode of 
right-sided
sensory disturbance and lightheadedness.

Mr. ___ reports being in his usual state of health this
morning as he was driving to work; on turning the corner just
after pulling out from his house, around 07:20, he noted acute
onset of lightheadedness (without vertigo or disequilibrium) as
well as right-sided sensory disturbance. He reports having
previously had similar episodes of lightheadedness for which he
was evaluated by Cardiology, who noted minimal atrial and
ventricular ectopy on cardiac monitoring, and advised Mr. 
___
that he would likely need further cardiac monitoring if his
symptoms recurred to evaluate for an occult arrhythmia. However,
he denies a similar prior history of sensory disturbance, which
he describes today as initial ""tingling"" paresthesiae of the
entire left arm and much of the left leg (sparing the ankles and
feet) replaced by mild numbness when rubbing his arm with his
left hand for the next ___ minutes. He denies associated
headache, neck pain, photo- or phonophobia, nausea, vomiting, or
a radicular or radiating pattern to his sensory symptoms, and 
has
not had recurrent symptoms since initial onset. He discussed
these symptoms with his son, who is an internal medicine
resident, who recommended presentation to the ED for further
evaluation.

On review of systems, aside from the above, Mr. ___ denies
recent headache, vertigo, speech disturbance, vision change,
diplopia, hearing change, dysarthria, dysphagia, focal weakness,
paresthesiae, bowel or bladder incontinence, gait disturbance,
nausea, vomiting, chest discomfort, palpitations, abdominal 
pain,
changes in bowel or bladder habits, myalgias, arthralgias, or

Brief Hospital Course:
PATIENT SUMMARY:
================
Mr. ___ is a ___ right-handed man with history 
notable for apical variant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, HTN c/b 
CKD, pituitary microadenoma c/b hyperprolactinemia, and 
hypothyroidism presenting with a transient episode of 
right-sided sensory disturbance and lightheadedness.

NCHCT negative for acute stroke. MR with very small punctate 
subacute infarct in the left centrum semiovale. A stroke in this 
area explains his right sided sensory changes. Exam is normal. 
Etiology is likely small vessel disease
vs cardioembolic. 

Before MR imaging was finalized, seizure was on the differential 
for his transient symptoms, thus EEG was performed. Final read 
pending at time of discharge.

Risk factor labs notable for A1c 5.1%, TSH 3.9, LDL 46. Given 
LDL < 70, no indication to increase statin dose at the present 
time.

He was started on Aspirin 81 mg daily.

Given cardiac history and possible cardioembolic etiology, TTE 
was obtained. This showed apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
without left ventricular or atrial mass (cardiac MRI would be 
more sensitive for focal apical thrombus, TEE for left atrial 
appendage thrombus). Mild mitral regurgitation. 

Ziopatch was placed for extended cardiac monitoring to assess 
for occult atrial fibrillation.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
- Continue aspirin 81mg for stroke prevention

- Ziopatch in place. Follow up read.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr ___,  

 You were hospitalized due to symptoms of right sided sensory 
changes resulting from a TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK, a condition 
where a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain 
is blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your body that 
controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage 
to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result 
in a variety of symptoms.  

 Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
 - High blood pressure  
 - High cholesterol

 We are changing your medications as follows:  
 - Please start Aspirin 81mg daily to help prevent future 
strokes 

 Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
 Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  
 
 If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
 - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
 - Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
 - Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
 - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  
 
Sincerely,  
Your ___ Neurology Team

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Liver biopsy

 
History of Present Illness:
HPI: Pt is a ___ G2P1 at 26w2d who is admitted to the 
___
service with elevated LFTs. She reports a two-day history of
diffuse pruritus and jaundice. Pruritus was so severe that she
was unable to sleep. She found no relief from Benadryl, Tylenol
___, oatmeal baths, or topical hydrocortisone cream. She could 
not
find a rash, and when she had her mother search her skin, her
mother first noticed scleral icterus. She denies any history of
liver disease, or any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fevers,
chills, or myalgias. She denies any change in color of her
stools, hematochezia, or melena, but does note that her urine is
now the color of ___. She has never had symptoms like this
before, although she does give a history of mildly elevated 
LFTs,
maybe ___ years ago, which on recheck were reportedly normal last
year.

She has a history of poly-substance abuse, including IV drug 
use,
although she acknowledges only a single use of IV heroin. She
does acknowledge other heroin use, intranasally, twice
previously. She denies any history of intranasal cocaine use. 
She
has previously abused narcotic pain medications, but has been on
methadone for the last six months since she has known about her
pregnancy, and has not used any drugs including tobacco, EtOH,
and narcotics. She denies any tattoos or piercinges (apart from
her earlobes bilaterally), and no history of blood transfusions.
She has not been sexually active recently as her husband has 
been
away from home, travelling to ___ for business. She denies any
herbs, supplements, or OTC medications apart from Tylenol ___ and
Benadryl. Regarding the Tylenol ___, she states that she took two
tablets two days ago without any relief, and took two tablets
yesterday prior to coming to the ED. She does note using an
oatmeal-based bath for her pruritus that she purchased from a
nutritional supplement store. She also acknowledges having eaten
out a number of times during her pregnancy, especially in recent
weeks during the ___. These include sushi ___ roll,
denies any uncooked fish), cold cuts (including ___, ham, and
___ cheese), fruit salad from an outdoor fair, and others. She
also does acknowledge prior hypertension during this pregnancy,
about one month ago, when she was advised to ""keep an eye on 
it"",
so she has been checking herself at ___. She notes that her 
worst
BPs have been as high as 190/90.

She did have some vomiting and diarrhea this morning, which she
attributes to withdrawing from her methadone as she did not
receive this morning's dose at the usual time of her home
schedule, and since receiving it these symptoms have resolved.

She was reportedly seen first at an OSH ED prior to transfer to 
our ED
given her elevated LFTs, but these records were reportedly ""lost
on the way"" and are unavailable for review currently.

___ BPP

Indication: Abnormal LFT's, Methadone for prior substance use
# of Fetuses: 1
Cardiac activity?: Y
FHR: 130BPM
Presentation: []Cephalic []Breech [x]Other: Transverse
Placenta:     []Anterior [x]Posterior []Fundal
Previa?:      []Y  [x]N
AFI: DVP  7.3cm    [x]Normal []Oligo. []Poly.

BPP: Active Fetus

Impression:
1. Reassuring fetal testing. 

___ LIVER US
1. Normal liver echogenicity. No biliary duct dilatation. 
2. Limited Doppler due to breathing motion; however, normal flow 
is seen in main, left, and right portal vein, and main hepatic 
artery. Wall-to- wall flow in the hepatic veins. 
3. Unremarkable gallbladder with no evidence of cholelithiasis 
or 
cholecystitis. 

___ Liver, needle core biopsy:

1.  Marked portal and moderate periportal and lobular mixed 
inflammation with lobular disarray and numerous apoptotic 
hepatocytes.
2.  Moderate intrahepatic and canalicular cholestasis.
3.  No significant steatosis or ballooning degeneration are 
seen.
4.  Trichrome stain shows minimally increased portal fibrosis.
5.  Iron stain shows no stainable iron.
6.  Reticulin stain does not demonstrate significant hepatic 
parenchymal necrosis or collapse.
7.  Immunohistochemical stains for cytomegalovirus and herpes 
simplex viruses are pending and will be reported in an addendum.

Note: The features are compatible with a moderately active 
hepatitis with mixed inflammation, lobular disarray, feathery 
degeneration of hepatocytes, and moderate cholestasis.  The 
differential diagnosis includes an acute hepatitis of viral or 
drug-induced etiology.  Given the patient's negative autoimmune 
serologies and lack of prominent lobular plasmacytic component, 
an acute presentation of autoimmune hepatitis is less likely. 

ADDENDUM: 
Immunostains for cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex viruses I 
and II are negative with satisfactory controls.
Addendum added by: ___. ___
Date: ___

  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the antepartum service from ___ 
to ___ for transaminitis, jaundice, pruritus with 
coagulopathy. A hepatology consultation was obtained. A liver 
ultrasound with dopplers showed no evidence of fibrosis or other 
abnormalities. The hepatology team was significantly impressed 
by the extent of liver injury and requested a biopsy of the 
liver. Pathology was consistent with acute hepatitis. 
Viral antibody studies were sent and these were signficant for a 
positive hepatitis C antibody. Her viral load was 54,700 copies. 
Patient was counseled about this new diagnosis and questions 
were answered. 
.
Her transamnitis began to resolves spontaneously and her INR 
normalized. Her only complaint of pruritis was managed with 
pepcid, atarax and actigall.
.
Fetal testing was reassuring. EFW ___ was 1038g, 58.5 percentile 
(___).
Patient had labs pending at discharge including bile salts, HEP 
C viral RNA genotype and soluble liver antibodies. 
.
___ need follow-up with Hepatology after discharge. She 
opted to see a specialist closer to her rather than following up 
with the ___ here. She will need assistance with the 
referral. She will need monthly LFTs and viral load every 3 
months. She will also need to discuss treatment options after 
postpartum.  She is aware that this will have to be set-up by 
her primary physicians.  Please help her coordinate this.

inpatient lows on home insulin regimen. Please titrate diabetic 
medications. 
- Recommend stress mibi as outpatient given new regional wall 
motion abnormality on echo
- Recommend re-addressing goals of care. Patient is full code 
for now but would like to think about it. 
- Recommend calibration of home BP cuff with office 
measurements.
- Discharged on 4 days of cefpodoxime for UTI. Please follow up 
culture.

with
acute onset dizziness/vertigo. 

Awoke at 4AM feeling okay. Went to BR, then on way back to bed
acute onset vertigo (horizontal room spinning, unclear which
direction), sat down. Took a drink of water and became 
nauseated,
had several episodes of NBNB emesis. Lay down and vertigo
resolved. Daughters called ___. In ambulance sitting up, again
with vertigo, asked EMS to have her lie down which they did,
vertigo improved somewhat but did not resolve. Persisted 
somewhat
improved into waiting room for ER and triage, then resolved.
Sitting semi-reclined patient denies ongoing vertigo but thinks
if she sits up will have it again. Reports that she is unsure if
lasted more than two minutes each time as she was unable to
tolerate sitting up long enough to see if it would resolve. 

Denies loss of vision, vision changes, blacking out, LOC,
headaches, numbness, weakness, difficulty thinking or speaking,
confusion. Denies congestion but reports having the ""flu""/URI 
two
weeks ago, then developing the shortness of breath/CHF
exacerbation and UTI (reports no urinary or abdominal symptoms
with the UTI). 

Had multiple medication changes during her recent admission,
outlined below, notably with changes in antihypertensives and
addition of spironolactone and increase of torsemide (currently
on extensive antihypertensive regimen including isosorbide,
carvedilol, spironolactone, irbesartan, amlodipine, torsemide)
after felt that she had primary hyperaldosteronism (renin and
aldosterone still pending).  

She has permanent AF on Xarelto. She has not been off
anticoagulation since ___ when she had her thymectomy
and denies missed doses of medication. 

In ED for ED physicians per report NIHSS 0, HINTS testing no
corrective saccade, no skew.

# Pyelonephritis with sepsis: Patient presented with several 
days of urinary sx's, UA w/ many WBCs, bacteria, and RBCs, CVA 
tenderness on exam, and febrile all consistent with 
pyelonephritis. No other localizing symptoms to suggest other 
source for infection. She has had ___ UTIs in past, grown 
ampicillin-sensitive enterococcus, klebsiella, and E.coli, but 
nothing that was multi-drug resistant. Renal ultrasound obtained 
was negative for hydronephrosis or abscess. She received a dose 
of IV Ceftriaxone in the ED then started on vancomycin and 
cefepime for empiric coverage in the ICU.  She was transitioned 
to PO Ciprofloxacin as Urine culture grew Pan-sensitive E coli 
with plans to complete a 10 day course through ___.

# Atrial Fibrillation: EKGs all demonstrated sinus rhythm, 
however she has a hx of AF and her heart rates were as high as 
130 in the ED. Her heart rates improved with IVF. Home Coreg and 
rivaroxaban continued.

# Hypertension, Mild hypernatremia, Hypokalemia, primary 
hyperaldosteronism: Patient was started on spironolactone for 
hyperaldosteronism that was recently discontinued in ___ for 
hyperkalemia.  Since that time her blood pressure and 
electrolytes were controlled on torsemide, carvediolol, 
amlodipine, and irbesartan. On admission her some of her 
antihypertensives including torsemide were held as a precaution 
in the setting of infection/sepsis.  These were resumed with 
recovery of blood pressure.  Sodium was noted to be 148 two days 
in a row after sepsis physiology had resolved despite good PO 
intake. The patient described polyuria and polydipsia but 
appeared euvolemic on exam and felt that hypernatremia was most 
likely due to hyperaldosteronism. She was restarted on low dose 
spironolactone with plan for close outpatient monitoring for 
development of hyperkalemia. 

# DMII: Home 70/30 regimen was continued and Victoza resumed at 
discharge.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ woman with multiple vascular risk factors, including 
prior stroke, atrial fibrillation on River Oxilan and aspirin, 
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, insulin-dependent diabetes 
mellitus, who initially presented with persistent vertigo.  She 
reported a positional vertigo that did not dissipate initially 
on rest.  ED evaluation was notable for hyperglycemia to 430.  
She reported some recent changes with her diabetes medications, 
followed usually by her primary care.  There were no neighboring 
signs or symptoms, or additional review of system features 
suggestive of a peripheral vestibulopathy, such as neuronitis, 
or Ménière's disease,.  Her exam was not suggestive of central 
vertigo, though given her risk factors, she was admitted for 
stroke workup.  Her CTA was unremarkable.  MRI did not reveal 
any stroke, but did show an evolution of white matter disease in 
the periventricular areas.  Therefore, the most likely etiology 
of her symptoms was felt to be hyperglycemia causing 
vertigo-like symptoms, versus benign paroxysmal positional 
vertigo.  Her vertigo-like symptoms dissipated overnight into 
the next morning after admission.  Her blood sugars were better 
controlled while admitted, though her A1c was 12.7 reflecting 
likely poorly controlled diabetes as an outpatient. She 
indicated a desire to follow-up with her primary care provider, 
but as well as the ___ further 
management.  She was advised to stay hydrated to avoid the 
effect of glucose related diuresis.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

Your admitted to the hospital for vertigo, or a room spinning 
sensation.  Sometimes, vertigo is caused by stroke in part of 
the brain, so you are admitted for close monitoring and further 
workup.  Thankfully, your MRI did not show any strokes.  You 
felt better the next day in terms of vertigo, and you were able 
to walk around the hospital without any issues.  The most likely 
explanation for your symptoms therefore is something called 
benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, which can occur when the 
inner ear has problems with debris that builds up over time.  
The other possibility is your elevated blood sugars, which can 
certainly cause dizziness that may mimic vertigo.  In addition, 
the sugar in your blood can act as a diuretic medicine, removing 
more fluid than you are able to make up for by drinking.  This 
may lead to additional lightheadedness and feelings of dizziness 
which may have contributed to her symptoms.  If this happens 
again, you may be referred either to a neurologist or ___ 
rehab to help you with the symptoms, during which they may 
perform certain maneuvers to clear the debris from your year.  
Please contact your primary care provider if the symptoms recur. 
 However, if the symptoms persist, or are accompanied by changes 
in vision, including double vision, or weakness or sensation 
changes, please report to the nearest emergency department as 
they may reflect stroke.  Otherwise, please continue all of your 
medications as directed and do not miss doses.

It was a pleasure taking care of you.

PERTINENT STUDIES
===================
TTE ___

CONCLUSION:
The left atrial volume index is moderately increased. The right 
atrium is moderately enlarged. There is no,evidence for an 
atrial septal defect by 2D/color Doppler. The estimated right 
atrial pressure is ___ mmHg.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with a 
normal cavity size. There is moderate global left ventricular 
hypokinesis and relative preservation of apical function. There 
is beat-to-beat variability in the left ventricular 
contractility due to the irregular rhythm. Quantitative 3D 
volumetric left ventricular ejection fraction is 36 % (normal 
54-73%). There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract 
gradient. No ventricular septal defect is seen. Tissue Doppler 
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP 
greater than 18 mmHg). There is Grade III diastolic dysfunction. 
Normal right ventricular cavity size with low normal free wall 
motion. The aortic sinus diameter is normal for gender with 
normal ascending aorta diameter for gender. The aortic arch 
diameter is normal. There is no evidence for an aortic arch 
coarctation. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally 
normal. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is no aortic 
regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with no mitral 
valve prolapse. The transmitral E-wave deceleration time is 
short (less than 140ms) c/w restrictive filling. There is 
moderate [2+] mitral regurgitation. The pulmonic valve leaflets 
are not well seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear 
structurally normal. There is moderate [2+] tricuspid 
regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
normal cavity size and moderate global systolic dysfunction c/w 
a nonischemic process in the setting of beat to beat variability 
in systolic function. Increased PCWP. Grade III/IV diastolic 
dysfunction. Restrictive
filling pattern. Normal right ventricular cavity size and 
low-normal systolic function. Moderate mitral regurgitation. 
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension.
Compared with the prior TTE ___, the findings are 
similar.

TEE CARDIOVERSION ___
CONCLUSION:
There is no spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the body of 
the left atrium/left atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage 
ejection velocity is mildly depressed. No spontaneous echo 
contrast or thrombus is seen
in the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage. The 
right atrial appendage ejection velocity is normal. There is no 
evidence for an atrial septal defect by 2D/color Doppler. 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately 
depressed. There are no aortic arch atheroma with no atheroma in 
the descending aorta to 30 cm from the incisors. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal. No masses or 
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No abscess is seen. 
There is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened with no mitral valve prolapse. No masses or 
vegetations are seen on the mitral valve. No abscess is seen. 
There is a central jet of moderate [2+] mitral regurgitation. 
The tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal. No 
mass/vegetation are seen on the tricuspid valve. No abscess is 
seen. There is mild [1+] tricuspid regurgitation. The estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is borderline elevated.
IMPRESSION: No intracardiac thrombus seen. Moderate left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction. Moderate mitral regurgitation.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY STATEMENT:
====================
___ female with a history of NICM (EF 40% in ___,
AF on xarelto, CKD stage IIIb, h/o stroke ___ no
residual deficits, DMII, HTN, who presents with 4 days of
dyspnea, found to have elevated BNP and pulmonary congestion on
CXR, admitted for heart failure exacerbation with new afib 
likely a contributing factor, improved with diuresis and 
successfully TEE cardioversion into sinus rhythm on ___.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[] Restart amlodipine on follow up per outpatient provider. 
Blood pressure as inpatient was managed with Carvedilol which 
may not be sufficient as monotherapy
[] Restarted torsemide 40 PO on discharge, assess for fluid 
status on follow-up
[] Repeat echo if continues to be in sinus rhythm. If she 
continues to have low EF, consider guideline directed medical 
therapy.
[] Follow up is being scheduled with her cardiologist within 2 
weeks
[] Consider discontinuation of aspirin depending on whether she 
has a indication for it
[] Insulin regimen reduced to 30u in AM and 20u in ___ of 70-30 
(in addition to liraglutide) due to relative hypoglycemia while 
inpatient, please titrate per outpatient provider
[] Switched from rivaroxaban to apixaban due to chronic kidney 
disease.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
==============
# Acute on Chronic HFrEF:
# NICM: 
Presentation is c/w subacute onset of HF exacerbation thought 
___
afib and dietary changes in the last week, with wt gain, 
elevated
BNP and JVP. She likely also had a flash pulmonary edema which
caused the acute worsening the morning of presentation, which
quickly resolved with bipap. She diuresed well with IV Lasix and 
on discharge resumed torsemide 40 daily. It is thought her 
atrial fibrillation was actually new which triggered her HF 
exacerbation. She had an echo showing newly reduced EF of 36%, 
but it is thought this may be secondary to tachycardiac mediated 
cardiomyopathy.

#?New AF with rapid rates on arrival: 
The patient has a chad2vasc of 7. Despite chart diagnosis of 
pAF, no objective evidence in Atris or Partners charts of atrial 
fibrillation (she had some EKGs with NSR and frequent PACs), so 
we treated this is new atrial fibrillation. Nonetheless came in 
on rivaroxaban which she had taken for several years and was 
switched to apixaban in the setting of CKD. She does have a 
remote history of taking Pradaxa as far back as ___. Seems she 
switched to rivaroxaban ___. It is thought her new Afib 
contributed to her heart failure. She underwent successful TEE 
cardioversion (no ___ clot) with 360 J shock on ___ 
(unsuccessful 200J shock). She was discharged on carvedilol 50 
mg twice daily and rivaroxaban was switched to apixaban due to 
concern for kidney function.

#Transaminitis
Likely ___ hepatic congestion iso CHF exacerbation, downtrended 
with diuresis.

# T2DM on insulin: she reported some low blood sugars to ___ at
home, on liraglutide and 70/30 at home 36U AM 44U ___. Decreased 
to 30 AM 20 in ___ due to low sugars here.

# CKD stage IIIb: Cr 1.3 on admission, baseline is 1.0, may be
cardiorenal, improved on discharge.

# History of CVA
# Non-obstructive CAD in ___, negative pMIBI in ___: 
- continued ASA
- continued BB as above 
- continued statin

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___.

WHY WAS I ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL?
- You were admitted to the hospital because of shortness of 
breath and an irregular heartbeat.

WHAT HAPPENED WHILE I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL?
- In the hospital, we performed some lab tests to determine the 
reason for your shortness of breath. We also performed 
measurements of the electrical activity of your heart, which 
showed that it was beating in an irregular rhythm. We gave you a 
pill that would reduce the amount of water your body held onto 
as well as medications to decrease the resistance against which 
your heart pumped. These medications also decrease your 
heartrate. We also performed some imaging to look at your heart. 
Because your heartbeat was so fast and irregular, it wasn't 
pumping blood efficiently. The medications helped with this, but 
you required an electrical shock to convert your heart back into 
regular rhythm. We are glad you are feeling better after these 
procedures.

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME?
- Please take all of your medications exactly as prescribed and 
attend all of your follow-up appointments listed below.
- It is particularly important that you do NOT miss ___ dose of 
your apixaban.

We wish you the best!
Your ___ Care Team

MRI PELVIS W/O & W/CONTRAST  ___ 9:15 ___

MRI PELVIS W/O & W/CONTRAST

Reason: assess for perirectal abscess. 
Contrast: MAGNEVIST

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
___ year old man s/p liver transplant, rectal fissure surgery, 
fever. 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
assess for perirectal abscess. 
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

EXAMINATION: MR pelvis.

INDICATION: Status post liver transplant. Rectal fissure 
surgery, fever. Evaluate for perirectal abscess.

COMPARISON: Comparison is made with the previous MR from ___.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images were acquired 
on a 1.5 Tesla magnet, including dynamic high-resolution 3D 
imaging, obtained prior to, during and after the uneventful 
intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg of gadolinium-DTPA. 2D 
and 3D reformations and subtraction images were performed on an 
independent workstation.

MR PELVIS FINDINGS: In the ___ o'clock position (when viewed 
lithotomy position, left-to-left/posterior) of the 
intersphincteric space situated approximately 2 cm proximal to 
the anus, an area of crescentic high signal intensity is 
identified on the T2-weighted imaging (series 6, image 26) that 
measures 1.5 cm AP x 7 mm TV x 1.5 cm SI, with a peripherally 
enhancing rim, consistent with a tiny abscess too small to 
drain. This is at approximately the level of the levator ani 
(series 105a, image 14), and might communicate inferiorly with 
the rectal canal at the 6:00 location (series 100, image 68), 
approximately 4.5 cm superior from the anal verge.

A thin slip of high signal on T2W images (series 6, image 29), 
with thin curvilinear enhancement extends from this tiny 
collection inferiorly along the intersphincteric space and along 
the expected location of the internal sphincter from the 
___ location until reaching the anal verge, where there is 
thickening of the external sphincter on the left side (series 
104a, image 27). It is unclear if this represents a tract, or 
may be secondary to previous surgery or granulation tissue. This 
lays along the course of the fistula described in ___. No 
definite fluid is seen along this slip. Susceptibility is seen 
along the inferior aspect, similar to images from ___. The 
internal sphincter is hypoenhancing on post- gadolinium images, 
and indistinct but slightly hyperintense on T2W images, again 
possibly due to prior surgery.

There is nonspecific edema and vascular engorgement within the 
perirectal fat.

There are bilateral hydroceles with an inguinal hernia on the 
left containing some peritoneal fat and fluid. Left ureteral 
catheter is seen with pigtail curling within the bladder. 
Bladder is nondistended.

No evidence of any significant lymphadenopathy. The remainder of 
the bowel where visualized is unremarkable. The osseous 
structures where visualized are normal.

2D and 3D reformations provided multiple perspectives for the 
dynamic series.

IMPRESSION:
1. Small intersphincteric abscess from the 3 to 6 o'clock 
location (from lithotomoy position) on the left at the level of 
the levator ani. This may communicate with rectal lumen 
inferiorly, crossing the internal sphincter at the 6 o'clock 
position as described above, but is too small to drain.
2. No drainable abscess.
3. Mild hyperintensity on T2W images, mild enhancement, and 
thickening of left external sphincter along course of previously 
___ MRI) described intersphincteric tract, which may represent 
residual tract, or postoperative or granulation 
tissue--correlate with surgical history.
4. Bilateral hydroceles with left inguinal hernia containing fat 
and peritoneum.
5. Nonspecific edema and engorgement of vessels in perirectal 
fat. This may be due to hepatic disease and collateral portal 
blood flow.
6. Left ureteral stent with pigtail in the bladder. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
This was a ___ yo M s/p liver transplant in ___, pan-cytopenia, 
splenomegaly who presented with continuous oozing after tooth 
extraction.  Hospital course by problem below:  
Thrombocytopenia - platelet count of 69 on ___.  Platelet count 
on ___ was 14.  Neurontin (started on ___ and 
prophylactic antibiotics ___.  Neurontin was held.  DIC labs 
were negative for chronic DIC.  HIT Ab negative.  Parvovirus B19 
Ab negative. Bone marrow biopsy showed ITP. Prednisone and 
rituxan were not options for therapy given his history of Hep C. 
 The patient underwent two doses of IVIG at 35g, two days apart. 
He experienced only minimal improvement in his platelet counts 
each time, from ___.  He was also transfused platelets on two 
occasions, when his platelets decreased below 10.  he 
experienced only minimal improvement in platelet counts after 
transfusion, from ___.  It was decided that splenectomy would 
be the next best option for him. An abd CT was done on ___ to 
evaluate for splenic vein thrombosis. Findings were significant 
for non-occlusive thrombus adherent to the wall of the main 
portal, splenic, and the tributaries forming the SMV near the 
portosplenic confluence. 

On ___ splenectomy and distal pancreatectomy were performed. 
Surgeon was Dr. ___. Please see operative note for 
further details. A ___ drain was placed. Postop, he was sent 
to the SICU. Pain management was an issue requiring Acute Pain 
service management. He was trasferred out of the SICU to the 
med-surg unit where he continued to have high outputs via the JP 
(~ 3 liters) for which he received IV fluid replacements and 
albumin. Given that he had a distal pancreatectomy, the JP fluid 
was sent for amylase. This was initially 191 on ___, but 
increased to 4170 on ___. A repeat JP amylase on ___ was 2769. 
JP drainage trended down to 40 by ___

Bacteremia: Patient developed fever and leukocytosis on ___.  
He was treated empirically for a neutropenic fever with 
cefepime.  The following day his fever had resolved.  Blood 
cultures grew pan sensitive e.coli. His abx were switched to 
cipro, and his PICC line was removed. A source of his bacteremia 
was thought to be from a perirectal abscess identified on MRI.  
He remained afebrile while on cipro. A general surgery consult 
was obtained with recommendations for an MRI.  A MRI was done 
noting small intersphincteric abscess from the 3 to 6 o'clock 
location (from lithotomoy position) on the left at the level of 
the levator ani. This was non-drainable. Cipro and flagyl were 
recommended for 2 weeks. On ___ CVL was d/c'd for low grade 
temps. 

On ___ he was febrile to 101.2. Blood and urine cultures were 
negative. JP fluid was negative for growth. An abd CT was done 
revealing partially walled-off fluid in the left upper abdomen 
with air locules, interval progression of nonocclusive thrombus 
in the portal system, to a greater degree in the splenic vein 
and left portal vein, moderate left pleural effusion, and left 
nephroureteral stent in stable position, with moderate 
dilatation of the left renal pelvis, which has progressed from 
the prior study. A heparin drip was started. Coumadin was then 
started with goal inr achieved and discontinuation of heparin. 
He was sent home on a coumadin dose of 0.5mg qd with inr to be 
drawn on ___. 

On ___ he spiked a temp to 101.8. Blood and urine cultures were 
again sent with the urine negative and blood cultures negative 
to date. Vanco and Zosyn were started on ___. A CXR 
demonstrated L lung base atelectasis and a small left pleural 
effusion. A CT guided exchange of the drain was done for failure 
of the JP to drain. Upsizing of left abdominal drain as 
described above without immediate complications. Pull back study 
through track failed to demonstrate track communucation with the 
left thorax or left pleural effusion. The drain was upsized. 

Vanco and Zosyn were started on ___. After 3 doses, the zosyn 
was switched to Levaquin. Flagyl was added on ___. He was 
discharged home on Vanco, flagyl and Levaquin with indefinate 
duration pending resolution of fluid collection. He did complain 
of some loose stool which was sent for c.diff x 2. These were 
negative. 
.  
#) Hypertension -diltiazem and atenolol were continued at 25mg 
daily. He received his home doses of lasix (40 qam and 20mg 
qpm). Lower leg edema persisted.   
.  
#) Diabetes - Glargine was discontinued due to persistent low 
glucoses. Humalog sliding scale continued. ___ followed.   
Kcals were ordered for poor po intake and supplements were 
ordered. 
.  
#) Liver transplant - His tacrolimus, lamivudine (tx. liver from 
hep B+ patient), and prednisone were continued. His tacrolimus 
levels were monitored and dose adjusted based on levels.    

___ services were arranged for home as he was discharged with 
the JP in place. A picc line was also present in his Left arm 
for iv vancomycin. 

He was ambulatory with stable vital signs tolerating a regular 
diet at time of discharge. Labs were to be drawn on ___ with 
results fax'd to the Transplant office. Blood cultures from ___ 
finalization were pending (negative to date).

Brief Hospital Course:
He was initially seen in the ED. BP was 86/61 with a HR of 69. 
EKG showed a flutter. Hyperkalemia was treated and IVF was 
given. Cardiology was called. Home doses of Atenolol and 
Diltiazem were continued. No other intervention was done as the 
a flutter was well tolerated and well rate controlled. F/u with 
his cardiologist in 1 month was recommended. If a flutter were 
to persist, cardioversion would be considered. Given known 
recent + blood cultures of E.coli, repeat blood cultures were 
done. Vancomycin IV, po flagyl and po cipro were continued. TPA 
was given via the ___ line with positive results. A CXR 
confirmed placement. Blood cultures remained negative to date at 
time of discharge. The JP drain continued to drain ~ 45cc of 
dark brown fluid. 

He was continued on coumadin with a lovenox bridge. INR was 1.6. 
Coumadin was increased to 2mg once daily. Labs were to be drawn 
on ___ and ___. 

Of note, a UA and UCX were done on ___ to f/u the admission ua 
which had >50 ___ wbc and many bacteria. The ua on ___ 
showed ___ wbc, >50 RBC, many bacteria, negative nitrites and 
___ epi. Urology was called to see if the ureteral stent needed 
to be changed or removed. Per Urology note, there was ""no need 
to change the stent urgently. The UA could represent 
contamination vs
levaquin resistant bacterial colonization or infection. Given
normal WBC and lack of fever, would favor colonization, however,
due to immunosupressed state, would recommend continued
antibiotics until new culture data is back with F/U with Dr. 
___ in ___ weeks"".

Vital signs were stable, he was ambulatory and tolerating a 
regular diet at time of discharge.

Brief Hospital Course:
Temperature was 101 on admission. Urine and blood cultures were 
negative. The LUQ drain continued to have tan, thick drainage. 
On HD 2, he spiked a temperature to 102. WBC increased to 14 
from 11. Drainage was sent for culture. This grew proteus 
resistent to cipro otherwise pan-sensitive.  An abdominal CT was 
done on ___ as followup evaluation of the known portal vein 
thrombus and fever. This showed a large left pleural effusion, 
increased in size with increased lower lobe atelectasis. The LUQ 
pigtail catheter was unchanged in position with continued 
decrease in fluid about the catheter tip, nearly resolved. There 
was unchanged marked dilation of the portal, splenic, and 
superior mesenteric veins with extensive nonocclusive thrombus, 
also unchanged and unchanged left urothelial thickening. There 
was unchanged retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. 

Given these findings, CT guided drainage of the left pleural 
effusion was performed on ___. He received 6 units of  FFP 
prior to the procedure for INR of 4.5
450cc of sero-sanguinous fluid was aspirated with an 8 ___ 
pigtail drain left to external bag drainage. Cultures were sent 
with results noting 2+ pmn and no growth. 

He was initially started on cipro and flagyl, but these were 
switched to unasyn and vanco on ___. Pan-cultures were sent for 
persistent temperatures up to 102. Urine and blood cultures 
remained negative. Lungs remained diminished at the bases. 
Thoracic surgery was consulted for concern for empyema. On ___ 
he underwent VATS with decortication for left empyema.  Surgeon 
was Dr. ___. Please see operative note for complete 
details. FFP was given for reversal of coumadin effect. Postop, 
he did well. Pain was controlled with PCA dilaudid. Two chest 
tubes were to suction. Daily CXR was done. Diet was advanced and 
tolerated. 

Left lung tissue cultures grew staph aureus coag + resistent to 
levo, cipro, oxacillin, clinda and erythromycin. It was 
sensitive to vanco. The BAL culture grew klebsiella pneumoniae 
resistance to cipro, cephalosporins, but sensitive to meropenum, 
zosyn, bactrim and gentamycin. There was sparse yeast. Unasyn 
was switched to meropenum. He continue to have low grade 
temperatures with wbc trending down to 11. Meropenum was given 
from ___ and vanco continued from ___. Both were 
stopped per ID recommendations. A picc line was placed for 
antibiotics. This was removed on the day of discharge ___. He 
remained afebrile (no higher than 100)off antibiotics x 2 days. 

Coumadin was resumed on ___. INR slowly trended up on 3mg qd. 
This was decreased to 2mg qd on ___ for inr of 2.8.

LFTs trended up with alk phos increasing to 711 from baseline of 
mid ___. On ___ a transjugular biopsy was performed given that 
he was on coumadin. Unfortunately, the specimen was an 
insufficient sample. Alk phos started to trend back down 
slightly. Further biopsying was deferred. Immunosuppression 
remained the same with prednisone 3mg qd and prograf 1mg q pm 
and 0.5mg qam for levels that ranged between ___. 

Chest tubes were changed to water seal then the apical chest 
tube was removed leaving the lower lobe tube.  Follow up cxr 
showed a small left apical pneumothorax. The lower lobe chest 
tube was left in and converted to a pneumostat valve (to empty, 
attach ___ lock syringe and aspirate back). Drainage averaged 
___ cc of serosanguinous fluid non-foul smelling. 

On ___, follow up chest CT showed persistent left pleural fluid 
with decrease in the volume of subphrenic fluid in the left 
subphrenic space. Well perfused liver with slight decrease in 
size of thrombus in the aneurysmally dilated left portal vein, 
the extent of thrombus in the extrahepatic portal and splenic 
veins was unchanged. A new fluid collection was noted 
inferomedial to the right kidney. No hydronephrosis was present. 


The plan was to leave the chest tube in place until after the 
LUQ pigtail catheter is removed.The LUQ pigtail drainage 
averaged ~ 20cc of tan thick fluid. 

He was discharged home on ___ ambulatory and tolerating a 
regular diet. 
He will follow up with Drs. ___ in the 
outpatient clinic. ___ services were arranged and follow up labs 
were ordered.

___ Vanco-19.___ y/o male s/p liver transplant ___ years ago now with recurrent 
fever after drain removal 2 weeks ago from known fluid 
collection in the splenectomy bed.
He was started on Vanco and Meropenum and a CT of the abdomen 
obtained on admission showed:
-Reaccumulation of intraabominal abscess within the left upper 
quadrant.
-Left pleural collection small in size with thicked, enhancing 
pleura likely representing empyema, decreased in size compared 
to prior.
-Stable partial chronic thrombus seen within the portal vein and 
splenic veins which are markedly dilated.
After undergoing reversal of his INR with FFP, he underwent 
percutaneous drainage of the known fluid collection in the 
abdomen. Approximately 50 cc of purulent fluid was aspirated, 
with sample sent for culture and gram stain. The catheter was 
attached to a drainage bag and left to open drainage. An attempt 
was made to aspirate any collection in the pleural space, but no 
fluid was available for aspiration.
The fluid culture grew Proteus and this will be continued to be 
treated with IV Meropenum until re-evaluation by the ID team as 
an outpatient. Blood cultures drawn at the beginning of the 
hospitalization have been consistently negative, however there 
are several that remain pending at the time of discharge.
He has had intermittent periods of low grade fevers, but he has 
been afebrile for 36 hours.
He will be followed by Transplant surgery, Pulmonology and 
Infectious disease.
Repeat CT scan to be performed as outpatient.
He is being discharged to ___ facility

RUQ U/S ___
DOPPLER EXAMINATION: There is no flow in the splenic vein or any 
portal venous branches, due to extensive thrombus, to the 
portosplenic confluence. There is venous flow adjacent to the 
portovenous confluence, which may represent SMV or venous 
collaterals. There is normal hepatic arterial and hepatic venous 
flow.  
IMPRESSION: No flow in the splenic vein or portal venous 
branches, similar to prior CT. Extensive thrombus within the 
main portal vein. No focal liver
lesions. Cirrhosis without significant ascites.
.
CXR ___
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of ___, very little 
interval change.
No evidence of acute focal pneumonia. Continued enlargement of 
the cardiac
silhouette with effusion or blunting of the left costophrenic 
angle. Mild
prominence of interstitial markings persists. 
IMPRESSION: Little overall change.
.
CXR ___
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of ___, there is little 
change.
Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists with blunting of 
the

No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old ___ yr s/p liver transplant with recurrent hepatitis 
C, esophageal varices, acties, portal vein clots, 
encephalopathy, mild jaundice presents from clinic with 
hypotension, diaphoresis and lethargy.  
.  
## Hypotension/Fever/Infectious work up: SBP improved on the 
floor without intervention. Patient appears dry on exam, and may 
have poor po intake in the setting of recent teeth extraction. 
___ also be related to increase in pain medication. Afebrile and 
nontoxic appearing. Denies localizing symptoms for infection. 
Orthosatics were negative on admission. Patient did have one 
temperature in house to 101, but remained afebrile after that 
with antibiotics. Culture data (including blood and urine), UA, 
as well as Chest xrays and RUQ u/s were unrevealing. Patient did 
have recent bottom teeth removed, so he was given Chlorhexadine 
mothwash for sterility as this could potentially be an 
infectious source. Patient's lasix was held for concern of 
worsening blood pressure and for decreasing sodium. Plan to 
restart lasix as outpatient pending repeat labs. 
.
## Change in Mental Status: Patient fully oriented on exam 
throughout hospital stay. Mild asterexis which indicated hepatic 
encephalopathy could be contributing.
- Continue rifaximin  
.  
## Acute renal failure: Cr 1.6 from baseline 1 on admission. 
Given Fena less than 1 BUN/Cr ratio of 23, very likely pre-renal 
in etiology. Cr improved back to baseline with gentle hydration 
prior to discharge. 
.  
## HCV cirrhosis S/p liver transplant: LFts at baseline. No 
signs of dramatic encephalopathy.  RUQ u/s revealed previously 
known portal vein thrombus. Patient was continued on rifaximin, 
lactulose was restarted. Patient also continued on lamivudine. 
Prograf was decreased to 0.5 BID alternating with 0.5 daily 
given persistently high serum levels. Finally, coumadin was 
continued for aforementioned thrombus.  
.  
## DM: Continued ISS  
.  
## Psychiatry: Continued Zoloft  
.  
## H/o SVT: Continue betablocker and ccb. Remained rate 
controlled while in house.

Brief Hospital Course:
#. Increased INR - Patient with ESLD s/p liver transplant on 
coumadin for complete portal and splenic veins thrombosis, 
presented with an INR of 6.2. Reported decreased PO intake. His 
synthetic function seem to be at his baseline on admission with 
albumin of 2.6, bilirubin of 3.3, no acute liver process on RUQ 
U/S. Possibly due to vitamin K deficiency  coumadin effect. He 
received 5mg of vit K and 3 units of FFP on admission. Upon 
transfer to ___ 10 his INR was decreasing. On the day of 
discharge his INR was 1.4 and he was instructed not to take 
coumadin until he was seen at transplant clinic on ___.
.
#. Acute on chronic renal failure - Patient with known Stage II 
CKD, currently w/ increase in Cr up to 2.4 x 1 week but his UOP 
continued to be at baseline. His decreased to Cr 1.7 after 1L 
IVF. His ARF was  thought to be due to pre-renal azotemia 
because of dehydration and this was validated by his great 
response to hydration. His FeNa was 2.7% and FeUrea was 57% and 
the discrepancy between these values and pre-renal azotemia was 
thought to be due to the patient being on diuretics at home as 
these could account for the FeNa being high. His Cr was 1.3 on 
discharge which is baseline. 
.
#. Cough - Patient presented with 2 weeks of cough and unchanged 
CXR from basline. This was thought to be due to a viral URI and 
patient's condition improved while in the hospital. 
.
#. ESLD s/p transplant - Pt with elevated INR but no other signs 
of acute liver failure. His tacro level is whithin target range. 
RUQ U/S is unchanged w/ complete obstruction of portal and 
splenic veins. He was continued on his home dose medications.
.
#. SVT - Pt with h/o SVT, rate control with double nodal agents. 
Atenolol was switched to metoprolol initially for ease of dosing 
and ARF since atelolol is renally metabolized. Upon discharge he 
was switched back to his atenolol home dose. He had no issues 
with SVT during his hospitalization.
.
#. ITP - s/p splenectomy PLTs remained stable throughout 
hospitalization.
.
#. Primary hypogonadism - Patient had no issues. Testosterone 
was continued.
.
#. Depression - Patient denied any SI or thought of harming 
others. Rare zoloft s/e could be ARF and considering recent 
increase of dose this could have caused ARF. Zoloft was held 
initially and continued upon discharge.
.
#. DM - Thought to be steroid induced, currently diet 
controlled, no issues w/ hyper or hypoglycemia
.
#. Hyperparathyroidism - Secondary to CKD. Stable. Continued on 
home meds.
.
#. Adiction - Pt with h/o polysubstance abuse. Continued on home 
methadone.
.
#. Splenectomy - Pt s/p splenectomy at risk of infection with 
encapsulated organisms. Afebrile did well throughout admission.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo m with hx of liver transplant with recurrent cirrhosis, 
admitted with AMS, fever, and apnea.  
.
AMS/Encephalopathy: Presentation to ICU with altered mental 
status was initially secondary to hepatic encephalopathy and 
delerium from multiple infections: pneumonia and abdominal 
abcess.  Initial work up involved: a lumbar puncture with normal 
CSF, CT of the head sig for no acute process, and negative blood 
and urine cultures.  An ultrasound of the abdomen showed chronic 
portal vein thrombosis.  Patient was continued on lactulose and 
started on rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy.  Mental status 
decompensated ___ during hospitalization secondary to 
iatrogenic narcotic overdose (see below for full details) in the 
ICU, but improved with narcan x1 and holding of all sedating 
medications (oxycodone, methadone, and trazadone).  Mental 
status improved to baseline with treatment of multiple infection 
and rifaimin and lactulose.
.
Apnea: Patient was found to be apneic and intubated in the ED.  
Respiratory depression was felt to be related to hepatic 
encephalopathy and delirium secondary to PNA and abdominal 
abscess infections.  Patient was extubated on ___ without any 
complications.   On ___ patient was agitated, placed on wrist 
restraints, and given haldol, trazadone and oxycodone in the 
ICU.  Upon transfer to the floor the subsequent day the patient 
was apneic with constricted pupils secondary to iatrogenic 
oversedation.  He was given narcan x1 and respiratory status 
improved.  All sedating medications, oxycodone, methadone, and 
trazadone were held.  Patient remained stable on room air 
without any respiratory problems and was restarted on his home 
dose of trazadone at a later date.  Patient had self tapered 
from methadone (see below) and this was not restarted as he no 
longer complained of pain. 
.  
Pneumonia: On presentation, patient was febrile with 
leukocytosis and was started on broad spectrum antibiotics.  A 
CT ___ showed a RLL pneumonia with parapneumonic effusions.  
Patient completed a course of antibiotic therapy for community 
acquired vs aspiration pneumonia with cefepime (___) and 
leukocytosis improved.  Interval CXR improvement of 
consolidation and repeat CT showed resolution of pneumonia.
.
LUQ abcess: This abcess is a recurrent process after distal 
pancreatectomy and splenectomy and has required multiple courses 
of IV antibiotics and drainage in the past.  Patient initially 
was started on Vanc (___), Flagyl (___), and 
Cipro (___).  CT of abdomen showed abdominal abcess (4 x 10cm) 
and patient went for ___ guided drainage.  Initial set of abcess 
cultures demonstrated proteus resistant to cipro.  He antibiotic 
regimen were changed to Flagyl (day 1: ___ and Cefepime 
(day 1: ___ and restarted ___.  A picc line was 
placed ___.  Patient was put on trial of PO bactrim DS 
monotherapy, which he failed and cefepime iv was reinitiated 
(___).  A second set of abcess cultures were sent which showed 
ESBL organism (pan-resistant klebsiella).  Infectious disease 
was consulted and the patient was maintained on iv cefepime 
throughout the rest of his hospitalization and the JP drain 
continued to drain ___ of serosangounous fluid.  Patient 
underwent ERCP with stent placement in the CBD for prevention of 
future reaccumulation.  A repeat CT of the abdomen ___ showed 
improvement of the fluid collection.  JP drain accidentally fell 
out when patient getting up out of bed ___ and was unable to 
be replaced under ___ because fluid collection not observable on 
CT.  Patient was discharged with iv meropenem ___ to rehab 
with follow up with infectious disease to determine when 
antibiotic would be transitioned to PO prophylactic regimen.  
.
Nutrition: An NGT was placed in the ICU and discontinued upon 
transfer to the floor.  The patient passed speech and swallow, 
but continued to have very poor PO intake while on the floors.  
Nutrition was consulted and calorie counts were done.  Patient 
was encouraged to increase PO intake but reported little 
appetite, and abdominal discomfort with eating.  A decision was 
made to replace feeding tube on ___ and tube feeds were 
started.
.
Hypercalcemia: Patient had hypercalcemia, and was maintained on 
IVFs.  TSH and cortisol were normal, and a PTH was abnormally 
within normal limits.  His endocronologist was contacted, who 
reported secondary hyperparathyroid disease from vitamin D 
deficiency.  His calcitriol was discontinued, with some 
improvement in his calcium levels.  A PTHrP was pending.  
Patient was discharged on his home dose of oral bisphosphonate.
.  
S/p liver transplant with recurrent liver failure: Tacro level 
elevated and on ___ was changed from home dose of 0.5 mg bid 
to 0.5 ever other day.  Elevation in trough thought to be in the 
setting of multiple antibiotics and being off coumadin. Patient 
was continued lamivudine for ppx and home ursodiol.  He was 
treated with lactulose and rifaximin was started.  Bactrim was 
changed to dapsone for PCP prophylaxis as patient was 
persistantly hyperkalemic.
. 
Chronic Pain: Patient has chronic rectal pain s/p fissures and 
multiple complications.  A rectal tube was put in place for skin 
protection given multiple bowel movements while uptitrating 
lactulose.  Rectal tube was d/c'd on ___.  While in the ICU, 
patient receiving home dose of gabapentin.  He was also given 
5mg Methadone tid, as regular dose could not be confirmed, and 
10mg of oxycodone.  On transfer to the floor patient was apneic 
secondary to overdose of sedating medications and narcan was 
given x1 with improvement in respiratory status.  Methadone and 
oxycodone were discontinued.  Pain was not an issue on this 
admission and methadone was not restarted as he was 
self-tapered.
.
PVT: Patient has chronic PVT and was on coumadin as outpatient.  
Coumadin was d/c since last hospitalization in the setting of 
elevated INR.  Decision made to keep patient permanently off 
coumadin.
.
Anemia: Patient has chronic anemia secondary to liver disease.  
Hematocrit remained stable throughout hospitalization.  
.   
Diabetes: BS only mildly elevated patient was initially 
maintained on ISS.  This was discontinued as his fingersticks 
were within normal limits. 
.  
Hypertension: Initially atenolol and Cartia were held given an 
episode of bradycardia in the MICU.  HR improved and patient was 
started on metoprolol while inpatient.  BP remained stable and 
he had no further episode of bradycardia.
.
SVT: Patient has a history of SVT, with a normal ECG in the 
emergency room.  Patient had an episode of bradycardia in the 
MICU (as above) and so diltiazam and atenolol were initially 
held.  Patient was subsequently started on metoprolol while 
inpatient and diltiazam was held.  Heart rate remained in 60-70s 
throughout remainder of hospitalization. 
.  
Coagulopathy: Patient had a recent supratheraputic INR, and 
coumadin was not restarted.  Coags were monitored and INR 
decreased and remained stable at 1.3. 
.
HyperKalemia: Patient had episodes of hyperkalemia, with normal 
ECGs and treated with kayexelate.  A hemolysis work up was done 
and was negative. His bactrim ppx was d/c'd and switched to 
dapsone.  Patient was started on florinef with improvement in K. 
 Florinef was discontinued and K remained within normal limits 
throughout rest of his hospitalization.
.
Depression: Patient was continued on home dose of sertraline.  A

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary: hepatic encephalopathy, pneumonia, abdominal abcess

Secondary: Portal vein thrombosis, ESLD s/p liver Tx, 
Depression, Secondary hyperparathyroidism, Chronic pain

 
Discharge Condition:
Stable

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were seen in the hospital for altered mental status, lung 
infection and abdominal infection.  You were intubated because 
you were not breathing well.  Your breathing and mental status 
improved as we treated your liver disease with lactulose and 
rifaximin and as we treated your pneumonia and abdominal 
infection with antibiotics.  

We put a drain to help resolve your abdominal infection, when 
the drain was discontinued we were not able to put it back in 
because there was no longer any fluid collection.  You underwent 
an ERCP and had a stent placed to prevent further reaccumulation 
of infection.  You were not eating well and so a feeding tube 
was placed.

The following changes were made to your medications:
1. You no longer need to take Cartia XT, methadone, lasix, 
Calcitriol, Drisdol, or Percocet.  
2. We have switched your tacrolimus from 0.5mg bid to 0.5 every 
other day.
3. We have added rifaximin to your medications, please take this 
daily.
4. Please continue with the rest of your home medications. 

Please return to the emergency room if you have fevers greater 
than 101, lightheadedness, abdominal pain, sleepiness, or any 
other concerning symptoms.

History of Present Illness:
___ y/o M w/ h/o hepatitis C s/p OLT in ___, now with recurrent 
hepatitis C and chronic rejection, with h/o splenectomy and 
distal pancreatectomy c/b fistula now, w/ peripancreatic abscess 
infected with ESBL Klebsiella who is now admitted s/p drain 
reinsertion. Patient's ___ abscess has been drained 
multiple times in the past, and has been treated with multiple 
courses of IV antibiotics. Most recently he was admitted for 
hepatic encephalopathy, and pneumonia requiring intubation. 
During that course, his intra-abdominal abscess grew an ESBL 
klebsiella that was treated with meropenem. Plan on discharge 
was for the patient to continue on meropenem until seen by ID as 
an outpatient and transition to PO antibiotics could be made. 
Prior to discharge patients drain fell out. Unfortunately, it 
could not be replaced as there was no clear fluid collection 
evidenced on the CT scan at that time.  
.  
On discharge patient was afebrile and doing well. He was 
discharged to ___ where he apparently complained only 
of loose stools. The patient attributes these stools to his tube 
feeds, and denies abdominal pain, constipation, fevers, chills, 
cough, shortness of breath or other complaints. A routine CT 
scan done for interval assessment of his abscess demonstrated 
that the fluid had reaccumulated (measured 4.7 by 3.3cm). He is 
now readmitted for observation after reinsertion of his biliary 
drain. The procedure was apparently uncomplicated. He has no 
complaints at the time of arrival to the floor.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ with hepatitis C cirrhosis s/p liver 
transplant with recurrent hepatitis C cirrhosis complicated by 
ascites/encephalopathy who was admitted with GIB/melena.
   
#.  LGIB:  Initial immediate concern was for UGIB, particularly 
variceal bleeding or portal gastropathy in this patient with 
decompensated liver disease.  Differential also included 
gastritis and LGI sources, including hemorrhoids, 
diverticulosis, AVM.  The patient immediately received 2U PRBCs 
post transfusion hct decreased from 25.9 in the ED to 25.8.  
Protonix gtt, octreotide gtt and ceftriaxone daily were started. 
 EGD was performed upon arrival to the ICU which showed 
non-bleeding esphageal and gastric varices as well as an oozing 
gastric polyp which was injected with epinephrine- nothing to 
suggest the cause of patients relatively brisk decrease in 
hematocrit.  Colonoscopy was performed on HD2 which again did 
not show any obvious cause of bleeding.  Dark old blood was 
noted to be transiting through the colon.  Hct trended down 
gently on HD2 and another 1U PRBC transfusion was given.  The 
patient underwent capsule endoscopy on HD2 which showed several 
small ulcers in the small bowel.
  
#. Hepatitis C cirrhosis s/p liver transplant:  Tbili slightly 
elevated from baseline although AST, ALT, alk phos improved from 
baseline.  Patient was not clinically encephalopathic while in 
the ICU.  Transplant surgery was consulted and aware of patient. 
Tacrolimus 0.5mg PO BID, Lamivudine 100mg PO daily (donor was 
HbcAb positive) and Ursodiol 300mg PO BID were continued.
   
#. Duodenal polyp- a non-bleeding duodenal polyp was seen on EGD 
that should be biopsied as an outpatient at a later date.

tacroFK-8.___ with hepatitis C cirrhosis s/p liver transplant with 
recurrent hepatitis C complicated by ascites, gastric and 
esophageal varices, and encephalopathy admitted with recurrent 
melena.   
    
1. LGIB: Reported to have melena, although at different time 
noted to have brown stool with bloody mucous. Immediate concern 
was for UGIB, particularly variceal bleeding or portal 
gastropathy in this patient with decompensated liver disease. Pt 
with small intestine ulcers on recent capsule study. EGD on ___ 
with non bleeding varices at the lower third of the esophagus 
and gastroesophageal junction, portal hypertensive gastropathy, 
polyp in proximal body of stomach, and 8 mm non bleeding polyp 
adjacent to hepatico-jejunostomy. The patient had an RBC scan, 
which showed no definite bleeding seen on 90 minute dynamic 
imaging, but activity in the rectum on left lateral is 
compatible with rectal bleeding. Pt had a sigmoidoscopy the next 
morning on ___ that noted blood coating the colon, but no e/o 
active bleeding. ___ declined angiography at this time, as it 
would be very low yield as no bleeding was noted on the RBC 
scan. Over the pt's ICU course, he was transfused 5 units pRBCs. 
The patient's HCT remained stable at 34 prior to call out to the 
floor. On the floor the patient remained hemodynamically stable 
however he continued to experience melanotic stools with a 
downward trend in his hematocrit. He became transfusion 
dependent, requiring about 2units/day. He subsequently had a 
CT-A to looked for vascular abnormalities such as scarred 
varices however this was unremarkable. A tagged red blood cell 
study was repeated which showed no source of bleeding.  The 
patient continued to have melena, requiring ___ units of PRBCs 
to maintain adequate hematocrit.  The decision was made between 
the patient and the team to proceed with an exploratory 
laparotomy and a possible endoscopy in the OR. The patient was 
taken to the OR on ___ with Dr ___. At the time of 
surgery a small enterotomy
was made longitudinally and just in the Roux limb just beyond 
the jejunojejunostomy. A colonoscope was advanced in from this 
location distally toward the terminal ileum and then withdrawn. 
No evidence of ulcerations or intramucosal or intraluminal 
pathology was identified. A second enterotomy was made distally 
in the mid to distal ileum, again transversely and then the 
colonoscope  was placed in this location and advance distally 
into the terminal ileum and then eventually into the cecum. This 
was withdrawn and again no identified lesions were noted. A 
bleeding source was not identified during the surgery.    
On POD 2 the patient had HR in the 130's and was found to be in 
Afib, he was given Beta blocker and monitored.
Hematocrit was trended, in the ensuing days he received a total 
of 4 units pRBCs. 
He was also evaluated by nutrition services. After following 
oral intakenit was determined to place a post pyloric feeding 
tube and start tube feeds.
The wound was having ascitic fluid drainage, several clips were 
removed and a VAC was placed. The patient had copius amounts of 
fluid from the VAC, and the output was repleted with 
intermittent albumin and IV fluids.
On POD 19 the patient was transferred to the SICU for increased 
confusion. A head CT was obtained which showed no evidence of 
acute intracranial abnormalities. 
The patient remained in the SICU for 8 days. He was additionally 
followed by neurology who atributed his confusion to 
encephelopathy of metabolic of infectious etiology. An LP was 
performed and infectious etiologies including cryptococcus were 
ruled out. He had been started on acyclovir pending results of 
LP, He received 6 days of this. In addition he received 6 days 
of fluconazole for yeast in the urine. An EEG showed an abnormal 
routine EEG in the waking state due to 
a mildly slow and disorganized background with frequent theta 
rhythms. 
There were no focal, lateralized, or epileptiform abnormalities 
noted. 
He also had an unremarkable BAL. He was covered with Vanco and 
meropenum, but never was febrile and all cultures were returned 
as negative and the antibiotics were discontinued.
The patient eventually cleared and was able to be transferred 
back to ___ 10. He continued to have large volume ascited from 
the wound VAC and continued with albumin and fluid replacements, 
the albumin replacement will continue upon discharge and extra 
fluids are being instilled with tube feeds.
Two days prior to discharge, he spiked a fever and had increased 
abdominal pain. His UA was concerning for a potential UTI, and 
he was covered with ciprofloxacin.  His urine cultures 
eventually returned contaminated, and the ciprofloxacin was 
dicontinued.  Additionally, his PICC line was removed and sent 
for culture, which showed no significant growth.
   
2. Acute on chronic renal failure: Creatinine 1.4 on admission, 
likely due to decreased perfusion in the setting of bleed. 
Improved to 1.0 but then elevated post op as high as 1.7. 
Medications were adjusted accordingly. With adequate hydration 
and use of albumin the patient once again returned to baseline 
creatinine of 1.1 by day of discharge.

History of Present Illness:
___ year old man with HCV cirrhosis s/p liver transplant 
(___) with recurrent hep C complicated by 
ascites/encephalopathy/varices (3 cords of grade I)/portal 
hypertensive gastropathy/chronic portal and splenic venous 
thrombosis, who was recently discharged from ___ on ___ after 
work-up of melena. He was at rehab until ___ when he was 
discharged home. He has been in his USOH until this morning when 
he noticed two dark stools, so his sister brought him to the ED. 
He reports being occasionally lightheaded but denies any fevers, 
chills, CP, SOB, cough, nausea or vomiting.  
.
During his previous hospitalization he had the following 
studies:
___: GI Bleeding study
___: Sigmoidoscopy
___: GI Bleeding study
___: Colonoscopy and EGD
___: Angiogram, no intervention
___: Exploratory laparotomy, intraoperative endoscopy.
___: Post pyloric feeding tube placement
.
A RBC scan showed no definite bleeding seen on 90 minute dynamic 
imaging, but activity in the rectum on left lateral that was 
compatible with rectal bleeding. Sigmoidoscopy: blood coating 
the colon, but no e/o active bleeding. ___ declined angiography 
at that time, as it would be very low yield as no bleeding was 
noted on the RBC scan. Over the pt's ICU course, he was 
transfused 5 units pRBCs. On the floor the patient remained 
hemodynamically stable however he continued to experience 
melanotic stools with a downward trend in his hematocrit. He 
became transfusion dependent, requiring about 2 units/day. He 
subsequently had a CT-A to looked for vascular abnormalities 
that was unremarkable. Repeat tagged red blood cell study was 
repeated which showed no source of bleeding. The patient 
continued to have melena, requiring ___ units of PRBCs to 
maintain adequate hematocrit. Exploratory laporotomy was 
performed on ___. A bleeding source was not identified during 
the surgery. Post-op he received an additional 4units PRBCs. 
Nutrition recommended a post-pyloric feeding tube and started 
tube feeds. His post op wound was draining ascitic fluid, so a 
VAC was placed. His hospital course was complicated by 
confusion, for which neurology was consulted. Please see 
discharge summary for details.
