Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old woman with a history of chronic 
anxiety and dysthymia who is brought to the emergency department 
by EMS due to worsening symptoms of depression, irritability, 
and expressed suicidal ideation. 
  
  
1. LEGAL & SAFETY:  
On admission, the patient signed a conditional voluntary 
agreement (Section 10 & 11) and remained on that level 
throughout their admission. She was also placed on 15 minute 
checks status on admission and remained on that level of 
observation throughout while being unit restricted.
  
  
2. PSYCHIATRIC
#Major Depressive Disorder 
At the time of presentation, the patient had difficulty fully 
describing her current mood state, almost to the point of 
alexithymia. She did endorse recent fatigue, poor sleep, poor 
appetite, anhedonia, decreased motivation, diminished 
concentration, and passive suicidal thoughts. While she denied 
suicidal plan or intent, she did note that she had recently felt 
worried that she may lose control and do something unsafe. 
Collateral from her boyfriend, in addition to patient's 
appraisal of her own functioning, was concerning for recent 
deterioration and heightened irritability and depressed mood. On 
initial exam, she had a restricted affect and made minimal eye 
contact with interviewers. 
  
Her presentation appeared most consistent with major depressive 
disorder, but there was additionally an element of 
trauma-related symptoms contributing to her presentation. 
Patient has a history of sexual assault and also described 
arguments with boyfriend evoking memories from childhood when 
she observed her mother/stepfather arguing. 

She reported previous medication trials of fluoxetine, 
citalopram, and duloxetine which were discontinued either due to 
ineffectiveness or side effects. She was started on Wellbutrin 
XR 150mg daily and Hydroxyzine 25mg BID:PRN anxiety/insomnia. 
She reported feeling jittery, anxious, with racing heart on 
Wellbutrin XR 150mg so was transitioned to Wellbutrin SR 100mg. 
She tolerated this well with no reported side effects. Over the 
course of her admission, she engaged in treatment, including 
individual therapy as well as groups focused on coping. She 
reported improvement in her mood and energy level. She denied 
any suicidal ideation, reporting that she was no longer in a 
dark place. She had a less constricted affect and was brighter 
and more reactive. At the time of discharge, she was 
future-oriented, looking forward to getting back to work. 
  
  
3. MEDICAL
#Chronic pelvic pain: Patient reported intermittent right-sided 
pelvic pain exacerbated by urination, bowel movements, and 
intercourse. She denied heavy or irregular menstrual bleeding 
and stated that she usually does not take anything for the pain, 
as ibuprofen and Tylenol have never seemed to help. Patient has 
had discussions about endometriosis with doctors in the past but 
has never been definitively diagnosed. She reports that her 
symptoms are currently at baseline and tolerable. She declined 
offer for PRN pain medication during this admission.
  
  
4. SUBSTANCE USE: Patient reported intermittent marijuana use.  
She was provided with counseling regarding marijuana use and 
possible negative impact substance use has on her anxiety/mood. 
  
  
5. PSYCHOSOCIAL
#) GROUPS/MILIEU:  
The patient was encouraged to participate in the various groups 
and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit.  The 
patient often attended these groups that focused on teaching 
patients various coping skills.  She was also noted to be social 
with her peers in the milieu and pleasant with staff members. 
  
#) COLLATERAL CONTACTS & FAMILY INVOLVEMENT:
Patient provided verbal permission to contact her outpatient 
therapist ___ ___ and her 
outpatient PCP (Dr. ___ ___. Providers were 
contacted for collateral information and for discharge planning. 
Patient also gave verbal permission to contact her boyfriend  
___ who provided the primary team with 
collateral information.
  

INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, 
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of 
starting Wellbutrin and Hydroxyzine, and risks and benefits of 
possible alternatives, including not taking the medications, 
with this patient.   We discussed the patient's right to decide 
whether to take this medication as well as the importance of the 
patient's actively participating in the treatment and discussing 
any  questions about medications with the treatment team, and I  
answered the patient's questions.  The patient appeared able to 
understand and consented to begin the medication.
  
  
RISK ASSESSMENT
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to herself and/or others based upon 
worsening functioning with passive suicidal ideation, fears of 
losing control and doing something unsafe.  Her static factors 
noted at that time include history of trauma and abuse, chronic 
mental illness, chronic pain (fibromyalgia, myofascial pain 
syndrome, chronic pelvic pain) .  The modifiable risk factors, 
which included lack of outpatient treaters, passive suicidal 
ideation, acute mood episode, and medication noncompliance 
(history of discontinuing several antidepressants due to side 
effects) were also addressed at that time.  The patient engaged 
in individual and group therapy focusing on coping skills during 
her admission; she was also started on Wellbutrin which she 
tolerated well and outpatient follow up was scheduled.  Finally, 
the patient is being discharged with many protective factors, 
including future-oriented thinking, willingness to seek help, 
and sense of responsibility to family.  Overall, based on the 
totality of our assessment at this time, the patient is not at 
an acutely elevated risk of self-harm nor danger to others.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ y.o female with h.o paranoid schizophrenia, HTN, HL, DM who 
presents with incontinence and abdominal pain and UTI and 
several abscesses s/p large MRSA perirectal abscess drainage in 
the OR. 
.
# R buttock abscess and several other sm buttock and thigh 
abscesses: Surgery consulted and drained large perirectal 
abscess in OR ___ and again ___. Cultures grew MRSA 
sensitive to doxycycline, bactrim, and vancomycin (as well as sm 
amt of corynebacterium). Pt initially started on doxycycline but 
this was transitioned to vancomycin after infectious disease 
consultation. She was transitioned to bactim and will complete a 
full course of this. Pt had several additional abscesses, 
including one on R thigh that was I+Ded at bedside (by surgery). 
Pt had careful wound care to buttock wound to avoid stool 
contamination and foley to avoid keeping the wound wet (pt 
frequently incontinent and retained urine often). However, 
patient did not need a foley near the end of her discharge. 
Prior to discharge patient did not have a foley and her urine 
volume was less than 200 cc. Discharged without a foley. Pt's 
pain was controlled c oxycodone plus dilaudid for dressing 
changes. However, near the end of her discharge, patient 
required minimal pain medication. 
.
# UTI: Pt found to have pan-sensitive pseudomonas. She was 
treated with ciprofloxacin for 5 doses (combination of IV and PO 
as pt sometimes refused PO meds and sometimes pulled out her 
IVs). Her last dose was IM cefepime (as pt refusing POs and had 
no IV access at the time. Repeat UA and Ucx without growth.
.
# abd pain on admission: ? ___ UTI. Pt had ab/pelvis CT on 
admission which was reassuring and abd pain improved c treatment 
of UTI. She continued to have intermittent lower abdominal pain 
when foley was out. Patient intermittently retained urine and 
foley improved her pain. Patient's foley was removed for >48 
hours prior to discharge and she was not retaining, however 
incontinent. She did not have pain. Bladder scan prior to 
discharge was less than 200 cc.
.
# Elevated INR: Pt noted to have elevated INR and low albumin 
and mildly enlarged liver on CT abd/pelvis. Hepatitis serologies 
were negative and INR improved c 3d of vitamin K. 
.
# Constipation: Pt started on miralax, colace, senna, bisacodyl. 

.
# Hypotension on admission: pt's blood pressure meds were held 
and her BP trended up. Enalapril was planned for continuation, 
however she developed a slight increase in her Cr to 1.3 (from 
1.0). She was given fluids prior to discharge as her labs 
appeared hemo-concentrated. Cr should be re-checked two days 
post-discharge in rehab and this medication should be 
re-evaluated.  HCTZ was discontinued.
.
# urinary retention: has been an occasional issue over the past 
___ months per her daughter. The etiology is unclear but 
initially felt to be ___ benztropine which was discontinued 
prior to admission. Haldol and klonopin can both cause urinary 
retention, however, neither of these meds are new to her, make 
this etiology less likely. Pt had foley placed after an episode 
of 900cc of urinary retention. It was initially planned that the 
foley would quickly be discontinued, however, it was ultimately 
continued through most of her admission ___ concern about her 
wound site getting wet as pt is incontinent. However was 
discontinued two days prior to discharge as patient consistently 
pulled it out. She did not retain urine and her dressing changes 
were more frequent (up to ___ times per day) to ensure a clean 
abscess site. Patient tolerated this well. 
  
# psychogenic polydipsia: free water restricted to 2L. Pt did 
not seem interested in drinking excessively during this 
admission.
.
# petichiae: Pt noted to have diffuse petichiae on lower 
extremities and chest. her CBC was checked and was within normal 
limits. Petichiae resolved. 
.  
# Paranoid schizophrenia: Pt was followed by our psychiatry 
department. She was continued on her meds from psych facility 
(haldol, klonopin, celexa, tegretol, zyprexa). Zyprexa and 
haldol were given IM when pt refused PO. Pt has ___ 
guardianship.  EKG showed stable QTc interval.
.  
# DM type 2, uncontrolled: On admission, pt was on sliding 
scale, she had also been discharged on 70/30 though it was 
unclear whether she had been getting 70/30 at her psych 
facility. Pt was started on lantus and humalog sliding scale 
which were titrated up aggressively given her elevated blood 
sugars. She maintainted appropriate blood sugars on regimen of 
44 units of Lantus with HISS.

# Anemia: continued iron supplementation. b12 and folate wnl. 
-Recommend outpt colonoscopy when psychosis improved (this was 
discussed with pt's daughter)

# CKD: at recent baseline, however had small increase in Cr to 
1.3. Likely pre-renal as further labs appeared hemoconcentrated. 
Gave IVFs prior to discharge. Should be rechecked in 2 days for 
further management.
.
# HL: Continued on home simvastatin.  
.
# Communication: Patient and her legal guardian ___

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to ___ for a urinary tract infection. We 
treated this with an antiobiotic called ciprofloxacin. You were 
also found to have several abscesses including one large 
___ abscess which was drained in the operating room 
under anesthesia twice. You recieved antibiotics for these 
abscesses and will need to continue while you are in rehab. Your 
sugars were very high, which probably made you more likely to 
get abscesses. We increased your insulin regimen. Good control 
of sugars is very important for fighting infection, for your 
heart and nerves and almost all of the rest of your body. 
Lastly, you seemed to be having incontinence with a full bladder 
(called overflow incontinence). You had a bladder catheter 
placed which help your incontinence and also helped keep your 
wound clean, however, you continued to pull it out. We kept it 
out and you appeared to be urinating without diffuclty. Prior to 
discharge we checked the amount of urine in your bladder and it 
appeared you were not retaining very much urine (< 200 cc) You 
may need to have one in intermittently if you continue to hold 
your urine. 

You should take your medications as prescribed with the 
following important changes.
1. CONTINUE: Bactrim DS 1 tablet every 12 hours every day and 
stop on ___
2. INCREASE Lantus to 44 units at bedtime. Please use sliding 
scale for further insulin coverage
3. HOLD Enalapril as you have some mild kidney dysfunction. You 
will have your kidney function monitored and this should be 
re-started once this normalizes.
4. STOP: HCTZ
5. Continue wound care as directed
6. START: Oxycodone as needed for pain
7. Continue Olanzapine and Haldol as directed.

It is important that you keep all of your doctor's appointments

Pertinent Results:
Troponin T <0.01, <0.___rief Hospital Course by Problem: 

#) Status post fall: on presentation to ___ patient was 
initially evaluated in the ER, and given that she had 
experienced an unwitnessed fall, she had multiple radiographic 
studies for furhter evaluation, CT of head showed no 
intracranial bleeding, CT of her cervical spine showed no 
fractures or dislocations, x-rays of her shoulders did not show 
any evidence of fracture.  Additionally in the ER, since her 
cervical spine had been cleared radiographically, they tried to 
clear her c-spine and take the cervical collar off but she 
complained of continued neck pain.  After speaking with 
neurosurgery, they recommended leaving the collar on for 2 weeks 
and then reassessing to see if her pain had resolved to take the 
collar off.  Patient can be seen by orthopedic surgery in two 
weeks for re-evaluation of the cervical collar.  Since the fall 
was unwitnessed and the patient was unable to give a good 
history, there was concern for the cause of this fall, patient 
was monitored on telemetry and also had an echocardiogram.  The 
echocardiogram was unchanged from prior studies, and while she 
was monitored on telemetry, it was noted that with reinitiation 
of her atenolol the patient's HR dropped to 35 while she was 
sleeping and then increased to the 40's when the nurses had 
woken her up.  Per nursing it was difficult to tell whether she 
was symptomatic since she seemed slightly confused at baseline.  
Given her decreased heart rate her atenolol was stopped and to 
control the patient's blood pressure, she was started on an ACE 
Inhibitor, lisinopril 10mg daily, that can be further titrated 
as an outpatient.  

#) Hypertension: Patient had previously been treated with 
atenolol 25mg daily, however given her very decreased HR, the 
medication was discontinued.  In the short term in the hospital 
she was controlled with 20mg po hydralazine, however for long 
term control she will be started on lisinopril 10mg daily, which 
can be titrated up as an outpatient.  Since she was just started 
on lisinopril, she will need to have her electrolytes checked in 
one week.

#) Dementia: remained stable in the hospital, continued her 
outpatient dose of aricept

#) Hypothyroid: currently being managed by her PCP, continued on 
her home synthroid dose

#) Osteoporosis: patient was continued on her calcium and 
vitamin D supplementation, however we would hold her 
bisphosphonate until the cervical collar is removed so that the 
patient can sit upright and take the medication safely. 

#) CAD: repeat echocardiogram showed no decline in LV systolic 
function, will continue aspirin but atenolol has been 
discontinued as patient's heart rate cannot tolerate beta 
blockade

Discharge Diagnosis:
1. Status Post Mechanical Fall

 
Discharge Condition:
At the time of discharge, patient was able to ambulate with a 
walker, tolerate oral intake without difficulty, her heart had 
increased off atenolol, other vital signs were stable and she 
was medically clear for discharge. 

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to ___ after falling at the nursing home, 
when you arrived in the emergency room, multiple radiology 
studies were done, which showed that you did have any bleeding 
your head or any other broken bones.  However, since you were 
still complaining of neck pain, even though the CT scan of the 
bones in your neck was normal, they were unable to remove the 
cervical collar.  Since no one had seen you fall, we were 
concerned about caused the fall, as a result we also did an 
echocardiogram to look at the function of your heart and 
monitored the rhythm of your heart while you were in the 
hospital.  The only concerning finding during your 
hospitalization was that when we restarted your atenolol, your 
heart rate decreased into the 30's while you were sleeping, and 
only increased into the 40's when you were awake, as a result we 
stopped this medication since we were concerned that this could 
have contributed to your fall.   

Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you have 
any other falls, experience a change in your vision, headaches, 
chest pain, palpitations or any other concerning symptoms.

History of Present Illness:
___ year old female past medical history of dementia, 
hypothyroid, hip replacement presenting from outside hospital 
with concern for new T9/T10 fracture status post mechanical 
fall.  
.  
Patient is a poor historian at baseline and unable to provide 
additional history. Based on review of medical record, she had a 
witnessed fall that was mechanical in nature immediately prior 
to presentation at outside hospital. No head strike, no loss of 
consciousness, no seizure activity. At the outside hospital, she 
had a CT of her head, neck, torso that reveals a T9/T10 
fracture. No other acute findings were appreciated. She was 
transferred for spinal surgery evaluation.  
.  
In the ED, initial vitals 97.9 66 188/72 18 97%. Imaging from 
___ were reviewed including CT Head, neck, torso which 
revealed t9/10 fx. ___ was consulted who recommeneded TLSO. 
While in the emergency department patient spiked a fever to 102. 
Fever work up was negative for evidence of meningitis, no 
pneumonia on CT torso. UA was performed which revealed 24 WBC, 6 
RBC, NO Bacteria. Blood and urine cultures were sent and are 
pending. Blood counts and renal function at baseline. Patient 
was given acetaminophen 650mg suppository. CT of the abdomen was 
performed which revealed pneumobilia and dilated common bile 
duct. Surgery was consulted and felt that this was similar to 
prior CT examination and recommended no intervention. Patient 
did recieve flagyl, however no other antibiotics were given as 
they were felt to not be indicated. Vitals on transfer to the

Studies:
.
CT Abd - IMPRESSION: 1. Unchanged moderate intra- and 
extrahepatic biliary dilation with smooth tapering of the 
hepatic duct below the insertion of the cystic duct. Gallbladder 
distension is likely related to the ductal process rather than 
acute cholecystitis given the lack of wall thickening or 
pericholecystic fluid but clinical correlation is advised. 2. 
Possible 12-mm hypodensity in the head of the pancreas which is 
most likely focal fat deposition and is unchanged from the prior 
study. A mass cannot be entirely excluded and MRCP could be 
obtained if clinically relevant. 3. No findings to explain a 
sterile pyuria. 4. Colonic diverticulosis without evidence of 
acute diverticulitis. 5. Marked degenerative changes of the 
thoracolumbar ___ with further cortical destruction of the T9 
vertebral body. 
.
MR ___ - 1. Findings involving the T9 vertebral body, as on 
the prompting CT, likely represent a relatively acute 
osteoporotic compression fracture with very prominent fracture 
cleft. 2. While there is no significant loss of height, there is 
some retropulsion of its dorsal cortex with possible impingement 
upon the exiting right T9 nerve root. 3. Associated abnormality 
of, particularly, the right anterolateral paraspinal soft 
tissues at this level, with an overall appearance most 
suggestive of associated hemorrhage/granulation tissue, with no 
finding to specifically suggest a neoplastic process. 4. Bone 
marrow signal abnormalities involving the contiguous T10 
vertebral body, supporting underlying osteoporotic nature of 
this process, related to axial- loading injury. 5. Several 
chronic thoracolumbar vertebral wedge deformities with 
retropulsion, as detailed; in particular, there is significant 
spinal canal narrowing at the T12-L1 level, with deformity of 
the distal spinal cord but no discrete signal abnormality. 6. No 
other pathologic focus of enhancement seen to specifically 
suggest neoplastic disease. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female past medical history of dementia, 
hypothyroid, hip replacement presenting from outside hospital 
with concern for new T9/T10 fracture status post fall who 
developed fevers in the ED.  
.  
#. Mechanical Fall: Initially there was concern for T9/T10 
Fracture at ___. The pt was transfered to ___ for 
orthopedics ___ eval who determined that the fracture was not 
acute. They recommended a TLSO for comfort only. Due to concern 
for possible malignancy, the patient underwent MRI scan of the 
___ on ___ which showed a relatively acute osteoporotic 
compression fracture with very 
prominent fracture cleft but no evidence of neoplastic disease. 
The patient was in a significant amount of back pain initially 
and received a combination of opiates, toradol, standing tylenol 
and lidocaine patch. In discussion with the patient's nursing 
facility it was determined that this pain was not much changed 
from the patient's baseline and that at the nursing facility the 
patient receives oxycontin 30mg BID. The patient was placed on 
this regimen with good improvement in pain although continues to 
have difficulty with turns/sitting/deep breahing. The TLSO brace 
was not yet ready at time of discharge. Discharged with plan for 
further pain management per provider at ___. Of 
note, a vertebroplasty was discussed to help palliate the 
patient's pain however it was decided that the risks outwighed 
benefits in this ___ year-old woman.
.  
#. Fever: The patient develoepd a fever to 102.0 in the ED. No 
clear source was identified initially. A UA showed pyuria 
however no bacteria and was nitrite negative. A CT torso at 
___ without evidence of pulmonary infiltrate.  Pt 
arrived to floor with foley in place, per records it was placed 
at ___ prior to transfer. This foley was removed on 
admission to the floor. Blood and Urine cultures remained 
negative and a respiratory viral screen including influenza was 
negative. The patient was afebrile throughout the remainder of 
her hospital course. 
.  
#Dementia- Pt severely demented at baseline per family. In the 
hosiptial she was oriented to eprson and place. At times able to 
answer questions appropriately. Continued on home donepezil.
.  
#Hypothyroidism- Continued home levothyroxine.
.
#. Transitional Issues:
1) Pain control: Optimize pain regimen with PO medications and 
can consider vertebroplasty as outpatient if not improving.
2) Orthopedics reccomended a TLSO brace for comfort. The brace 
was not yet ready at time of discharge. Can consider ordering at 
___.
3) Was saturating ~90% on RA. Most likely due to splinting from 
pain. On 2L O2 NC on discharge. 
4) Discontinued Seroquel as patient was overly sedated in-house. 
Can re-start if alertness improved at nursing facility.

transferred to ___ for management of possible wrist 
compartment syndrome.
.
# Alcoholic Pancreatitis: The patient presented with severe 
epigastric pain, an inability to tolerate PO, and abnormal LFTs. 
She was found to have hyperbilirubinemia, transaminitis, 
hyponatremia and an anion gap metabolic acidosis. She was given 
IV fluids and IV morphine for pain control. Over the course of 
her stay, the patient started to tolerate a regular diet without 
nausea and vomiting. Her pain was better controlled and her LFTs 
trended to normal ranges. The patient was discharged with 16 
pills of Percocet and told to followup at her scheduled 
appointment or sooner with her primary care doctor if she 
requires more pain control. 

# ETOH Dependence/Withdrawl: The patient reportedly had been 
drinking heavily over the past year. During her stay, she 
developed increased anxiety, tremulousness, fever, and 
tachycardia. She was started on a CIWA scale and required PO 
Valium to help her. She also reports vivid nightmares. Social

to explore as an outpatient. The patient has a desire to quit 
alcohol, but has too many life stressors. She was given Valium 
20 mg PO on discharge.

# Right Wrist Swelling: Orthopedics hand surgery evaluated the 
patient and thought that her swelling was possibly due to 
compartment syndrome. They recommended against surgical 
intervention and suggested keeping the arm elevated and 
controlling her pain. With elevation, the pain subsided. The 
hand always remained neurovascularly intact and had normal 
pulses/strength/sensation on discharge. Ortho hand said to 
followup PRN in their clinic.

Normocytic anemia: The patient continued to have a normocytic 
anemia. It was stable throughout her stay. If it persists, it 
will likely need to be assessed as an outpatient. On discharge 
her Hct was 34.8. 

Depression/anxiety: The patient has poor social support and 
psychiatric issues and uses alcohol to cope with her problems. 
Social work spoke with the patient and provided outpatient 
resources. She was given a three day supply of Ativan 1 mg BID:

ACTIVE ISSUES
.
# Fevers, bacteremia: Pt presented with fevers and rigors, N/V/D 
x 2 weeks. He was initially treated with gentamicin and then 
vanc and then zosyn at ___ over this time on multiple 
admissions, as described in the HPI. Blood cultures grew gram 
negative bacilli, later speciated as E coli.  His tunneled 
catheter was thought to be the most likely source and it was 
removed on ___ at ___. He was then transferred to ___ for 
further work-up and new line placement. He was started 
empirically on zosyn and switched to ceftriaxone when speciation 
from ___ returned as E. coli sensitive to ceftriaxone and 
ceftazidime. He does have a significant history of bacteremic 
infections, including lumbar osteomyelitis and bacterial 
endocarditis (unclear which valve, ?aortic) in ___ thought to 
be related to the peritoneal dialysis he was receiving at the 
time. Recurrence of these infections was considered as a 
possibility, especially given the fact that he endorsed lower 
back pain and had a III/VI systolic murmur. But he endorsed that 
his back pain is chronic, his murmur was noted in a transplant 
note from ___, and he had no other endocarditis stigmata, so 
these were thought to be less likely. It also was considered 
whether his painful joints could be infectious, but they were 
not warm, had minimal if any effusions, and he said that these 
joints are this painful at baseline. He was afebrile throughout 
his admission and blood cultures were consistently negative. He 
was switched on the day of discharge to ceftazidime 1g IV to be 
given at dialysis for 2 weeks. He will need follow-up at the 
___ clinic to monitor for signs of recurrent infection.  No 
TTE was obtained, given extremely low suspicion for 
endocarditis, however can consider doing this in the future to 
assess the cause of his prominent systolic murmur.
.
# ESRD: Pt was dialyzed on the day of admission, ___. His 
tunneled catheter was then removed at ___ on ___ and he was 
transferred to ___. Renal was consulted and they recommended 
that ___ place a new tunneled catheter for HD access. This was 
placed on ___ and he dialyzed immediately following placement. 
He is slated to have an eventual brachiobasilic fistula created 
with Dr. ___ the transplant service, who are following him 
longitudinally. He has a follow-up appointment with them 
scheduled for ___. His dialysis is coordinated by the prison on 
a MWF schedule and he will followup with the clinic there for 
his next dialysis session on ___.  Sevelamer was continued but 
at an increased dose.
.
# Joint pains:  Patient presented with L knee, ankle, big toe, 
and low back which have been worse over the past ___ months, but 
he apparently has had them for years. He has been treated for 
gout for years (though rheum at the prison has seen him and 
doubts gout). He attributes these current pains to gout. We were 
unable to attain original documentation of how the gout was 
diagnosed from the prison but he was treated for a flare as 
recently ___ with prednisone, ___, and allopurinol. There 
also was a question for septic arthritis or lumbar osteomyelitis 
given his bacteremia and fevers and PMHx of lumbar 
osteomyelitis, however his exam was not particularly impressive 
and this chronic time course would be unusual. He was maintaned 
on renally-dosed allopurinol (w HD) and his pain was controlled 
with oxycodone 5 mg q4 prn in house (for more reliable nonrenal 
clearance). He will followup with the prison clinic regarding 
the management of chronic joint pain. He was discharged on 
MScontin.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
.
# Hepatitis C: He has a history of chronic hep C with prior 
interferon treatment.He is not currently being treated. He 
presented to ___ with a mild transaminitis. It was unclear if 
this was acute from sepsis or evidence of evolving cirrhosis. He 
will follow up with the prison clinic regarding his chronic hep 
C. 
.
# Hypertension: Pt has baseline hypertension controlled with a 
home regimen. He was normotensive throughout his admission. Pt 
was restarted on home regimen but renal recommended stopping 
lisinopril, so it was discontinued on discharge.   
.
# Anemia: This is secondary to chronic renal disease, remained 
stable throughout admission. 
.
TRANSITION ISSUES
.
1. Fevers/bacteremia: Ensure afebrile, continue ceftazidime 
course. Consider ECHO to assess systolic murmur. 
.
2. ESRD: MWF dialysis.
.
3. Mild transaminitis: Consider repeat LFT's to ensure return to 
baseline.

___ TEE: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color 
Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal 
(LVEF>55%). There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic 
aorta at 35 cm. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The 
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. No masses or 
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen. No mass or vegetation is seen on the 
mitral valve. Mild (1+)ecentric mitral regurgitation is seen. No 
masses or vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but 
cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. There 
is no pericardial effusion. Impression: no vegetations seen  

___ Head CT w/o contrast: No hemorrhage, large territorial 
infarction, edema, mass, or shift of normally midline structures 
is present. Periventricular hyperdensities in the bilateral 
frontal lobes may represent acute infarcts or dilated 
___ spaces. The ventricles and sulci are normal in 
size and appearance. The basal cisterns are widely patent. 
Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated. 
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. 

___ CT T and L spine w/o contrast: 1. Destructive disc space 
changes at the L5-S1 disc space, endplate sclerosis and anterior 
osteophyte formation suggest that these are chronic changes from 
prior osteomyelitis. Comparison with prior imaging may be 
helpful. MRI is a more sensitive test for acute osteomyelitis. 
If the patient has a contraindication, a three-phased bone scan 
may be obtained.
___ CT pelvis w/ contrast: 1. The findings are in keeping 
with changes related chronic osteomyelitis/discitis at L5-S1. 
2. Grade 1 retrolisthesis of L5 on S1. 3. Moderate degenerative 
changes at the femoroacetabular joints. 4. No CT evidence of 
acute osteomyelitis or fracture. 
___ TTE: The left atrium is elongated. There is mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular 
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened (?#). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There 
are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. 
No vegetation seen (cannot definitively exclude).
___ ECG: Rate 78, Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation. Poor R 
wave progression, probably a normal variant. Non-specific ST-T 
wave changes, particularly in leads V4-V6. No previous tracing 
available for comparison.  
___ CXR: No acute intrathoracic process with an 8-mm nodule 
in the left base for with shallow obliques or non-emergent CT is 
recommended further evaluation.  
___ Xray pelvis: No fracture, dislocation, or definite 
radiographic evidence of acute steomyelitis, although please 
note evaluation of the inferior sacrum and coccyx is not 
optimal. If clinical concern is high, please note that MRI is 
more sensitive. 

 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Reason for Admission: low grade fever and chills at dialysis. 

___ yo M w/ h/o ESRD ___ to PCKD, on dialysis and recent 
admission for E. coli bacteremia who presented with chills and 
low grade fevers at dialysis session while on outpatient 
antibiotic (ceftazidime) regimen, now on vanc (___) and zosyn 
(___) with no growth in blood cultures to date. 
.
Active Issues:
# Low grade fevers- Patient was admitted for a temperature of 
99.8 at dialysis in the ___ week of treatment for e.coli 
bacteremia. Patient has been afebrile throughout admission and 
cultures drawn in the hospital had no growth.  Additionally 
cultures from ___ Dialysis unit from 
48hrs, 4 days and 7 days prior to admission had no growth.  
Because of this, it was felt that the patient's line could be 
left in place.  During admission, patient was treated with 
vancomycin (___) and zosyn (___). Patient had a history 
of osteomyelitis and endocarditis in ___, so these were 
evaluated with a TTE, TEE (requiring conscious sedation) and a 
CT spine which did not show evidence of current endocarditis or 
osteomyelitis. ID followed this patient throughout the admission 
and felt that given lack of fevers, negative blood blood 
cultures, and no obvious source, they felt he could go back to 
prison without antibiotics.
.  
# ESRD: Pt gets MWF dialysis, which was continued throughout the 
admission. Renal transplant service was made aware of patient's 
admission, as they are planning to create a brachiocephalic 
fistula for dialysis. Pt is on transplant list, transplant 
surgery elected to defer surgery while patient is being worked 
up for infection.  Continued home sevelamer, doxercalciferol and 
given lenient renal diet (per patient insistence) and was fluid 
restricted (1L/day). Patient will be seen by trasnplant shortly 
after discharge.
.  
# Joint pains: Pt w/ chronic pain of back, as well as L ankle 
and L great toe, which he attributes to gout. Patient remained 
on allopurinol during admission. Was not started on colchicine, 
and renal fellow recommended against this medication in ESRD 
patients. Ortho consult felt his back pain may be secondary to 
sacroiliitis. A pelvic xray did not show any fracture, 
dislocation, or acute osteo. A CT spine of his back did not show 
signs concerning for osteomyelitis either. Patient was continued 
on his home regimen of MS contin 30mg BID for chronic pain as 
well as started on NSAIDs for management of pain. Additonally 
complaining of locked DIP and PIP joints bilaterally, which was 
not actively assessed as an inpatient. Patient has outpatient 
follow up with orthopedic surgery.
.
# Hypertension: Patient's blood pressure ranged from the 
120s-140s in the hours after dialysis, to the 160s-190s in the 
day and a half leading up to the next dialysis session.  Patient 
c/o frequent HAs with elevated pressures and had an episode of 
vomitting with a BP of 177/90. During this time, pt had no 
papiledema or AMS. A CT head was negative for intracranial 
process and HA improved with hydralazine. Patient required 
several additional doses of hydralazine and lisinopril, and on 
the day prior to discharge, his standing lisinopril was 
increased from 5mg to 10mg PO daily with improved BPs 
(140s/80s). 
.  
Chronic Issues:
# Hepatitis C: Chronic hep C with prior interferon treatment. He 
is not currently being treated.  
- defer to outpatient management  
.  
# Anemia: Hct ranged from ___ throughout admission, baseline 
appears to be around 28. Secondary to chronic renal disease.  
Stable. Epo was held during admission for concern of possible 
history of parathyroid cancer. We were not able to locate 
records from his operation (only were able to determine from 
___ that it occurred in ___ in ___, 
___ prior to discharge.  After further discussion with 
nephrology, it was not felt that this distant and questionable 
history of cnacer should be a contraindication to epo so they 
were going to give instructions to resume epo in their sign-out 
to the patient's local hemodialysis center.
.  
# Lung nodule: 8 mm nodule in left base, new from prior studies. 
Will need follow up with non-emergent chest CT scan for further 
characterization as an outpatient.
.
Transitional Issues: Patient is incarcerated and gets his care 
at ___. Do not ___ any transitional issues.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital because you were having low 
grade fevers during your dialysis session.  You were being 
treated for a bacteria in your blood at your outpatient dialysis 
unit for the past 2 weeks, and so we were worried that the 
antibiotics you were on were not treating your infection.  While 
you were in the hospital, we gave you 2 strong antibiotics.  You 
did not have a fever in the hospital and we never found any 
bacteria growing in your blood.  The blood drawn at your 
dialysis unit also never had any bacteria growing in it. We did 
some imaging of your back and heart because we were concerned 
that you may have an infection in either of these areas, however 
there was no evidence of infection on these studies.  Because 
there is not evidence that you are still infected, we have 
stopped your antibiotics.  It is common to have low grade fevers 
while getting dialysis, so this may be a chronic event for you. 
If you remain afebrile over the next week (with a temperature 
not greater than 100.4F), you should be able to have a fistula 
or graft placed soon.  We have made an appointment with your 
transplant surgeon, Dr. ___, for next week (see 
details below), so that you will have close follow up and so the 
procedure will be done as soon as possible.

You were noted to have a lung nodule of unknown significance on 
CXR. You should follow up with your PCP and should be scheduled 
for an outpatient Chest CT to follow this.

Please continue your home medication as prescribed.  You no 
longer need to take Ceftazidime, the antibiotic you were getting 
at dialysis.

The following changes have been made to your medications:
- please INCREASE lisinopril to 10 mg daily
- please START ibuprofen 400 mg every 8 hours, if this isn't 
managing your pain, you can increase to 600 or 800 mg every 8 
hours.  Please be sure to take ibuprofen with food, do not take 
it on an empty stomach.
- please STOP taking ceftazidime.  There is no active evidence 
of infection, so you do not need any antibiotics right now.

The rest of your medications have not changed.  Please continue 
to take them as originally prescribed.

Chest X-Ray ___:
PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: Right-sided dual-lumen 
dialysis catheter tip terminates in the proximal right atrium, 
unchanged. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are 
within normal limits. The pulmonary vascularity is normal. 8-mm 
rim calcified nodular opacity within the left lung base appears 
unchanged. Lungs are clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax 
is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities. Multiple 
clips are seen in the right upper quadrant. Calcifications are 
noted in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, compatible with 
calcifications seen within innumerable left renal cysts on CT. 
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality, and no 
interval change from prior. 
.
MRI Lumbar spine without contrast ___:
Endplate erosion with loss of disc height at L5-S1 levels, with 
mild increased T2 signal, likely representing chronic discitis 
osteomyelitis. Additionally there is a disc bulge and bilateral 
facet arthrosis at this level causing moderate bilateral neural 
foramina narrowing and compression of the L5 nerve roots and 
abutting the S1 nerve roots. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old incarcerated male with ESRD secondary to Polycystic 
Kidney Disease on HemoDialysis with recent E. coli bacteremia 
diagnosed by Blood culture from outside hospital on ___ 
believed secondary to HD line infection, presented this time 
with fevers, chills/rigors, found to have 1 out of 4 bottle E 
coli bacteremia. He was stable and discharged on Bactrim for 1 
week. 
.
# Fevers: Patient admitted to ___ for the third time in the 
past month with fevers and rigors. Patient last had 
blood-culture proven E. coli bacteremia in ___. The 
source of infection is most likely the tunneled right-sided HD 
line, but blood cultures during this admission only grew E. coli 
in one bottle, so contamination of the sample by multiple 
hospital admission acquired skin flora cannot be ruled out and 
bacteremia cannot be ruled in. Patient's history is also 
significant for chronic osteomyelitis of his lumbar spine, but 
no acute infection was evident on MRI. Patient was initially 
treated wtih ceftazidime in the ED, broaded to 
vancomycin/cefepime, and after the culture returned GNR, 
narrowed to cefepime only. After speciation and sensitivity 
returned, and given question of bacteremia, patient was treated 
conservatively with Bactim DS once a day at evening for a total 
of 7 days without need for a line change at this time.
.  
# ESRD: He continued to receive MWF dialysis in-house. Renal 
transplant service and Transplant surgery were aware of pt on 
previous admission and were informed of current admission. 
Patient continued his home sevelamer, doxercalciferol, renal 
caps, and renal diet in-house.  
.  
# Chronic joint pains: Patient has chronic pain of back, knees 
and ankles which he attributes to gout. Previous ortho consult 
felt his back pain may be secondary to sacroiliitis, pelvic xray 
did not show any fracture, dislocation, or acute osteomyelitis, 
and CT spine did not show signs concerning for osteomyelitis 
either. Diagnosis of gout is questionable given chronicity of 
pains, location, and pain without signs consistent with acute 
gout flares. Rheumatology at the ___ has seen the patient and 
doubts gout. Have been unable to attain original documentation 
of how the gout was diagnosed, but pt was most recently treated 
for a flare in ___ with prednisone, ___, and 
allopurinol. MRI of lumbar spine was done this admission and 
showed signs of chronic osteomyelitis and bilateral neural 
foramina narrowing and compression of the L5 nerve roots and 
abutting the S1 nerve roots, likely the source of the pain. No 
evidence of acute osteomyelitis was seen. Patient's pain was 
controlled with his home regimen of MS contin and allopurinol.
.
# Hypertension: Controlled in house with home dose of lisinopril 
and metoprolol.
.
Transitional Issues:
1. Please follow up with pending blood cultures. 
2. Replacement of HD catheter once antibiotic course is 
complete.
3. Completion of bactrim course

  IMPRESSION: Prostatic volume of 23.5 with a predicted PSA of 
2.8. No abscess is noted. 

WBC Tagged Scan/ Bone scan (___)- negative
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ M with ESRD on HD, HTN, chronic osteomyelitis and multiple 
admissions for fevers presenting with fever following HD.

# Fevers - Patient has had multiple admissions for transient 
fevers, often following HD, with blood cultures occasionally 
positive for E.coli.  Fevers only began once tunnel catheter was 
placed, after AVF clotted.  ESR and CRP are at patient's 
baseline so unlikely acute on chronic osteomyelitis.  In 
addition, patient had no worsening of his low back pain.  
Radiography showed stable process as well. CXR showed no acute 
cardiopulmonary process.  Patient given vancomycin/cefepime x1 
in ER.  Overnight on HD1/2 patient spiked fevers to 103.2 and on 
HD2, tunneled catheter line was pulled and patient was started 
on vancomycin and ceftazadime with dialysis. Patient was given a 
line holiday for 2 days prior to replacement of line.  Line tip 
culture grew strep viridans, coag negative staph, non hemolytic 
strep and corynebacterium consistent with skin or oral flora. 
Blood cultures were negative to date on the day of discharge.  
Patient was afebrile following removal of HD line and did not 
have further fevers.  He completed a 7 day course of vancomycin 
and cefepime following the discontinuation of the HD line.  
Other potential sources of occult infection were investigation 
with a CT abdomen, prostate ultrasound, WBC tagged scan and bone 
scan.  All of these studies were negative for infection.  

# ESRD on HD - Patient gets dialysis ___. 
He was continued on his home sevelamer, doxercalciferol and 
nephrocaps while inpatient. He was dialyzed on ___ 
prior to removal of original tunneled HD line, and spiked a 
fever to 105.  The line was removed following dialysis and 
patient had a ""line holiday"" until ___ when a 
new tunneled cath was placed without issue.  Patient was 
dialyzed on ___ and ___ as scheduled following 
replacement of catheter.  He had no fevers during or following 
dialysis.  Patient has follow-up scheduled with surgical team 
regarding AV fistula v graft.

# Leukopenia/Thrombocytopenia - Has had WBC as low as 2.8 back 
in ___, this appears to be the first time platelets have 
dipped so low. Patient recently on bactrim which ended 1.5 weeks 
ago, and working diagnosis was residual thrombocytopenia due 
this antibiotic.  In addition, with history of HepC, may be due 
to decreased liver function.  Platelets initially trended down, 
but were increasing above admission levels at the time of 
discharge.

# Chronic pain - Has chronic joint pains which have been 
associated with gout in the past. Also with history of chronic 
osteomyelitis as above.  Pain was at baseline and well 
controlled on home regimen of amitriptyline, MS contin 30mg BID, 
ropinirole.  
  
# Hypertension: Patient was intiially continued on lisinopril 
and metoprolol at home doses.  On HD 4, blood pressures were 
elevated, likely in the setting of volume overload due to 
dietary indiscretions and no HD over the weekend.  Patient was 
given hydralazine 25mg q6h, and following dialysis with removal 
of 4.5L, pressures remained elevated.  Lisinopril was increased 
to 40mg daily as well and patient was discharged on hydralazine 
and new dose of lisinopril.   Consider titrating off of 
hydralazine as full effect of lisinopril is seen.
  
# Hepatitis C: Chronic hep C with prior interferon treatment 
dc'ed for GI bleed and ineffectiveness. He is not currently 
being treated.  
  
# Anemia: On prior admission Hct ranged from ___ throughout 
admission, baseline appears to be around 28, secondary to 
chronic renal disease and possibly iron deficiency.  Hematocrit 
remained at baseline throughout admission.

# Transitional issues:
- Please titrate down and discontinue entirely if blood 
pressures well controlled on increased dose of lisinopril.
- 8-mm rim calcified nodular opacity within the left lung base 
noted on CXR, patient will need a non-emergent CT scan to better 
evaluate  
- Patient will have follow-up with surgical team regarding AV 
fistula/graft.  This should be done as soon as possible to avoid 
further tunneled line infections.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
It was a pleasure taking care of you during your recent 
admission to ___.

You were admitted because of a high fever following 
hemodialysis.  You have had frequent fevers following dialysis 
in the past due to bacteria in your blood.  Blood tests were 
drawn and you were monitored in the hospital for 24 hours.  You 
did not spike any more fevers, and your blood cultures remained 
negative.  The catheter tip grew some bacteria, and so you were 
continued on antibiotics.  In addition, you had an abdominal CAT 
scan to ensure there was no infection in your abdomen.  This 
exam was negative.

Your tunneled catheter line was replaced after a ""line holiday"" 
for two days.

Medication changes:
- INCREASE lisinopril to 40mg daily
- START hydralazine 25mg four times day, this should be tapered 
down and discontinued as your blood pressure responds to the 
increased dose of lisinopril

(goal 10)and dose was up titrated to 10mg bid on ___. 

Labs were notable for hct that trended down daily to 24 on 
___. Epogen was planned for dialysis days. 

He was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating independently 
(steady on feet)and RLQ incision was clean, dry and intact with 
staples. The JP drain output was high initially (720ml/day)and 
thus the drain remained in place. Output decreased to 115 ml by 
postop day 5. JP drain fluid was serosanguinous and creatinine 
of this fluid was 6.8 ruling out a urine leak (similar to 
serum). He did have a small amount of scrotal edema and was

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old man with PMH of APCKD s/p CDC high 
risk donor transplant on ___ who presented from ___ with 
hyponatremia. 

#. Hyponatremia - The patient presented with a sodium of 121. 
This was thought to be related to decreased PO intake recently 
as he has been on a religious fast. Also had been drinking more 
when told to increase hydration for better kidney perfusion (see 
below). Exercises vigorously daily and likely loses salt in that 
setting. The patient's sodium improved while here with simple PO 
intake encouragement. Never had MS changes. Sodium was 133 on 
day of dsicharge. 

#. Renal txpt, AOCKD - The patient's Cr has been elevated since 
___ to 2.2 from a baseline ~1.8. No clear etiology and this 
remained stable while here. He was continued on all 
immunosupressives and taro level was at goal between ___. 
Urinalysis was unremarkable as was a renal ultrasound. Further 
follow-up as an outpatient is warranted. Continued on bactrim 
PPx. 

#. Hyperkalemia - The patient's potassium was elevated in house. 
Never had ECG changes. Switched to a low-K diet and Ace-I 
stopped. Potassium was 5.4 on day of discharge. 

#. Leukopenia - The patient had a mild leukopenia in house. 
Unclear etiology and resolved on its own prior to discharge. Was 
on azithro when admitted for a possible sinus infection, however 
had no infectious symptoms in-house and this was stopped. 

#. HTN - Lisinopril was held due to ___ and hyperkalemia. The 
patient remained normotensive in-house.

#. Osteoporosis - Continued home medications. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Please check chemistry panel and CBC this week. Fax results to 
___ Att: Dr. ___ ___
- Patient to follow-up with Dr. ___ on ___
- Ensure patient is eating three meals daily and staying well 
hydrated. Low potassium diet.
- Monitor BP. ___ need an alternative agent added if becomes 
increasingly hypertensive. Lisinopril was stopped in-house.

ACTIVE ISSUES 
===========
# Abdominal Pain
# Diarrhea, bloody
Presented with sudden onset diffuse abdominal pain shortly after 
eating dinner. CT scan with duodenitis of unclear significance, 
and mild enlargement of the kidney with perinephric stranding. 
No evidence of obstruction, appendicitis. Ischemic colitis 
considered given bloody stools, but given chronicity of pain 
with repeated normal lactate, was thought less likely. 
Infectious diarrhea is most likely given
immunosuppression with no clear history or symptoms of 
inflammatory diarrhea and reportedly unremarkable recent 
endoscopic evaluation. Stool studies unrevealing and abdominal 
pain/diarrhea improved without intervention, likely etiology 
viral gastroenteritis. He received dilaudid and acetaminophen 
while in house, discharged without opioids. By discharge was 
tolerating regular diet.  Consider GI follow up as an outpatient
 
# ESRD s/p renal transplant:
# Hyperkalemia
He has had prior subacute antibody mediated rejection in ___, 
with DSAs to DQ7 and B18, treated with IVIG, steroids, 
rituximab, and change of immunosuppression from rapamycin to 
tacrolimus. Biopsy in ___ showed more chronic damage. He has 
had moderate proteinuria for some time now, likely due to 
transplant glomerulopathy. He did not have ___ as Cr was near 
recent baselines per transplant database. Renal transplant U/S x 
2 w/ stable elevated resistive indices compared to prior studies
but no fluid collections, hydro with no changes on close follow 
up scan. Renal biopsy was deferred. Discontinued losartan and 
Bactrim given persistent hyperkalemia and started sodium 
bicarbonate 1300mg BID, atovaquone for ppx. 
Discharge Immunosuppression
- tacrolimus 3mg Q12h
- mycophenolate myfortic 360mg PO BID

hypertension, improved with increased labetalol and with 
addition of nifedipine. Discharge regimen labetalol 400mg TID 
and nifedipine ER 30mg QD. Losartan was discontinued 

# Bone/mineral disease: continued home dose cinacalcet

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital for abdominal pain and 
diarrhea. You had a thorough evaluation including a CT scan and 
stool studies. The stool studies were reassuring. The CT scan 
showed duodenitis (inflammation of your small bowel). The most 
likely cause of your pain and diarrhea was a viral infection of 
you GI system. 

During your hospitalization, you immunosuppression for your 
kidney transplant was adjusted. You were started on a new 
medication called atovaquone to prevent infection, as well as a 
blood pressure medication called nifedipine. Please stop taking 
the Bactrim and losartan. 

Please follow up with your outpatient providers as below.

Wishing you well,

He had persistent hyperkalemia throughout that admission
(5.5-6.0) so losartan & TMP-SMX were discontinued & he was
started on sodium bicarbonate.  He also had persistent
hypertension (SBP > 170) so his labetalol was increased &
nifedipine was initiated. 

On this admission, the patient noted increasing SOB since ___. 
He reports that the SOB progressed to SOB at rest & was worst
when lying flat.  He notes no CP, palpitations, or infectious
symptoms.  He states that he has felt like this in the past when
fluid overloaded prior to dialysis sessions.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ w/ ESRD s/p deceased donor renal 
transplant in ___ complicated by chronic allograft dysfunction 
(antibody-mediated rejection ___, biopsy-confirmed chronic 
transplant glomerulopathy, interstitial fibrosis & tubular 
atrophy ___, HTN, GERD, HCV s/p ledipasvir-sofosbuvir, & 
hyperparathyroidism s/p sub-total parathyroidectomy ___ who 
presented with increasing shortness of breath. 

# Dyspnea
# ?Acute CHF Exacerbation 
The patient presented with a history of orthopnea & dyspnea w/ 
CXR findings of bilateral effusions & pulmonary vascular 
congestion consistent with fluid overload state. His weight was 
noted to be higher recently from prior discharge. No medication 
non-adherence or dietary changes although the recent addition of 
sodium bicarbonate may be contributing due to increased Na load. 
Patient's blood pressures were uncontrolled & likely further 
increased his left-sided afterload. A TTE on ___ revealed 
elevated PCWP and E/E' with preserved EF. Overall patient 
reported symptomatic improvement with diuresis and his daily 
weights continued to trend down. Although there are no concerns 
of rejection based on a bland urine sediment and an unremarkable 
renal ultrasound, the etiology of the patient's volume overload 
may have been in part also been caused by worsening renal 
function as evidenced by creatinines in the 4s compared to his 
baseline of creatinine in the 3s. Patient was diuresed with IV 
furosemide PRN and transitioned to oral diuretics. His 
electrolytes are monitored and repleted as needed. His labetalol 
was increased to 600 mg 3 times daily and he was continued on 
his nifedipine 30 mg daily.

# ___:
# ESRD w/p transplant c/b chronic rejection:
Cr 4 on presentation, up from discharge 3.2 on ___. His elevated 
creatinine may be cardiorenal in etiology given clinical context 
and possible end-organ damage in setting of hypertension but 
worsening overall renal function cannot be ruled out given lack 
of significant improvement with diuresis. His renal US had no 
evidence/concern for hydronephrosis and there was less concern 
for rejection at this time given bland urine and lack of 
characteristics findings on renal US. The patient's renal 
function was trended daily. He was continued on his 
immunosuppressive regimen of mycophenolate, tacrolimus, and 
prednisone. His tacrolimus levels were trended daily. He was 
continued on atovaquone prophylaxis. His MAPs were maintained 
above 65. He is also continued on calcium and cinacalcet. Sodium 
bicarbonate was held in the setting of his volume overloaded 
state. His blood pressure was better controlled as noted.

# HTN:
The patient was noted to have systolic blood pressure readings 
in the ___. He was previously on losartan & labetalol last 
hospitalization but losartan was held on discharge given 
persistent hyperkalemia. At that time, labetalol dosing was 
increased to 400mg TID from 200mg BID & nifedipine ER 30mg QD 
was initiated. No evidence of renal artery stenosis in 
transplant kidney as though no changes in resistive indices. The 
patient's labetalol was increased to 600 mg 3 times daily and he 
was continued on nifedipine along leading to better blood 
pressure control.

# Mild Hyperkalemia:
Patient presented with mild hyperkalemia and on review of 
records, it appeared that patient was chronically mildly 
hyperkalemic. His hyperkalemia improved with ongoing IV diuresis 
with Furosemide. 

# Normocytic anemia:
His home hemoglobin was similar to baseline values in setting of 
end-stage renal disease. His CBCs were trended daily and he did 
not require a blood transfusion during his hospitalization.

# GERD:
Continued on his prior dose of ranitidine.

# Insomnia:
Continued on his prior dose of amitriptyline. His ramelteon was 
held due to concerns of possible toxicity to the renal 
transplant.

There is moderate pulmonary edema and layering bilateral pleural 
effusions. No pneumothorax.  The size of the cardiac silhouette 
is within normal limits.

___ TTE:
The left atrial volume index is mildly increased. The right 
atrium is mildly enlarged. There is no evidence for an atrial 
septal defect by 2D/color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with a normal cavity size. There is 
normal regional and global left ventricular systolic function. 
The visually estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is 
65%. There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract 
gradient. No ventricular septal defect is seen. Tissue Doppler 
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP 
greater than 18mmHg). Mildly dilated right ventricular cavity 
with normal free wall motion. The aortic sinus diameter is 
normal for gender with normal ascending aorta diameter for 
gender. The aortic arch diameter is normal. There is no evidence 
for an aortic arch coarctation. The aortic valve leaflets are 
moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve 
area 1.5-1.9 cm2). There is trace aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with no mitral valve 
prolapse. There is an eccentric, inferolateral directed jet of 
moderate [2+] mitral regurgitation. Due to acoustic shadowing, 
the severity of mitral regurgitation could be UNDERestimated. 
Due to the Coanda effect, the severity of mitral regurgitation 
could be UNDERestimated. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear 
structurally normal. There is mild [1+] tricuspid regurgitation. 
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There 
is a trivial pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
preserved biventricular systolic function. Increased left 
ventricular filling pressure. Mild aortic stenosis. Moderate 
mitral regurgitation. Mild tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate 
pulmonary hypertension.

___ MRI Left Hip w/o Contrast:
1. Mild degenerative changes of the left hip.  No findings to 
suggest 
infection or avascular necrosis. 
2. Chronic appearing tear of the anterosuperior aspect of the 
left acetabular labrum. 
3. Degenerative disc disease in the lower lumbar spine better 
evaluated on the dedicated lumbar spine MRI performed on the 
same date. 

___ MRI L Spine w/o Contrast:
1. L5-S1 loss of disc height, disc irregularity, endplate 
irregularities, and L5 loss of height are again demonstrated, 
suggesting either chronic 
spondyloarthropathy secondary to end-stage renal disease, versus 
sequela of prior discitis/osteomyelitis.  Also unchanged mild 
retrolisthesis and 
prominent epidural fat at this level.  Unchanged mild narrowing 
of the thecal sac and severe bilateral neural foraminal 
narrowing at this level. 
2. Mild spinal canal narrowing at L2-L3 and L3-L4 has progressed 
since ___. Moderate L3-L4 neural foraminal narrowing has 
slightly progressed on the right but is not significantly 
changed on the left. 
3. At L4-L5, moderate right and severe left neural foraminal 
narrowing, as 
well as mild, left greater than right subarticular zone 
narrowing, are not 
significantly changed. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o male with a history of ESRD ___ PCKD s/p 
deceased donor renal transplant (___) c/b chronic allograft 
dysfunction, now back on HD since ___, HCV s/p Harvoni, and 
HTN who presented with left flank/hip/testicular pain. 
Infectious work up was unremarkable. MRI spine was notable for 
degenerative disc disease, likely causing radicular pain. 
Chronic pain service and orthopedic surgery were consulted and 
recommended ongoing pain management. 

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
#Left flank/hip/back pain, severe uncontrolled pain
#Neuropathic pain
The patient presented with ___ weeks of left flank pain that 
then moved into his left hip, thigh, groin and left testicle. 
Initial evaluation was notable for CVA tenderness and left 
testicular tenderness concerning for UTI/nephrolithiasis vs 
epididymitis. CT abd/pelvis showed an atrophic kidney without 
nephrolithiasis or pyelonephritis and testicular ultrasound was 
equivocal for epidimyitis. He was initially started on broad 
spectrum antibiotics, which were discontinued after urine 
culture, GC & chlamydia returned negative. Given persistent 
pain, MRI L-spine and pelvis were done, demonstrating L5-S1 
changes c/w chronic spondyloarthropathy ___ ESRD vs sequela of 
prior discitis, as well as severe left-sided L4-L5 neural 
foraminal narrowing. The L4-L5 was felt to be the etiology of 
his pain given the correlating location. Chronic pain service 
and orthopedic surgery were consulted and provided recommends 
for pain management. He was continued on oxycodone, 
amitriptyline and started on tizanidine as well as lyrica with 
improvement in his pain. He will follow up in the ___ spine 
clinic for further management. 

#ESRD ___ PCKD s/p renal transplant c/b rejection now on HD
Presented with moderate volume overload, particularly noted to 
have bilateral pleural effusions on CXR. He underwent multiple 
daily sessions of dialysis with improvement and then was 
transitioned to his normal regimen. He had significant weight 
gain between sessions and required tighter fluid restriction, 
which should be continued as an outpatient. Additionally, his 
home prednisone and tacrolimus were continued.

#Acute hypoxic respiratory failure
#Acute pulmonary edema
Patient noted to have rapidly worsening hypoxia one evening 
during his hospitalization briefly requiring a non-rebreather. 
Repeat CXR showed significant pulmonary edema with bilateral 
effusions. He was started on a nitroglycerin gtt and underwent 
urgent bedside dialysis overnight with improvement in his 
clinical status. He was rapidly weaned to room air and remained 
stable for the remainder of the hospitalization. 

#NSTEMI
Troponin 0.08 on admission and continued to rise to 0.45 in the 
setting of fluid overload and acute hypoxic respiratory failure. 
EKG showed borderline submillimeter ST depressions in I, V5-V6 
(different from baseline), which was stable/improving on serial 
EKGs. He denied having any chest pain during this time. 
Cardiology was consulted and felt the presentation was 
consistent with type II NSTEMI due to fluid overload. Follow up 
TTE did not demonstrate a wall motion abnormality. Ultimately, 
cardiology decided against stress test at this time. He was 
discharged on his home aspirin with the addition of atorvastatin 
and metoprolol. 

#Atrial fibrillation 
Noted to be in atrial fibrillation on ___, which rapidly 
resolved within hours to a day. This was a new diagnosis for the 
patient, felt to be ___ fluid shifts vs less likely cardiac 
ischemia. TSH normal. His home labetalol was switched to 
metoprolol and his heart rate and rhythm remained stable. Given 
a CHADSVASC of 1, anticoagulation was not started.  

#Access
Newly placed fistula with some ulceration. He should follow up 
with Dr. ___ in Nephrology to evaluate as an outpatient. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
#Hypertension
He was continued on his home nifedipine. He refused several 
daily doses of labetalol, stating the dose was too high. Given 
new episode of atrial fibrillation, possible cardiac disease, 
and normotensive pressures without labetalol, he was switched to 
metoprolol and remained stable on this regimen.  

#Normocytic anemia 
Hemoglobin stable from prior, felt to be ___ anemia of chronic 
disease ___ ESRD
and iron deficiency. He was continued on his on iron 
supplementation. 

#GERD
- Continued ranitidine 

#BPH
- Continued tamsulosin

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[ ] Follow up in ___ Spine Clinic on ___ and with your 
primary care provider ___ ___ weeks 
[ ] Monitor pain, titrate medications as necessary, consider 
down-titrating back to oxycodone 10 mg TID if pain improves and 
able 
[ ] Monitor mental status on several sedating medications - 
consider stopping tizanidine in the future once pain improves 
given unclear benefit
[ ] Blood pressure regimen changed, follow up BP and titrate as 
necessary 
[ ] Developed one episode of atrial fibrillation, if future 
episodes occur, consider further discussion regarding 
anticoagulation 
[ ] Ensure the patient is adhering to a 1.5-2L fluid restriction 

[ ] Recommend follow up Echocardiogram in ___ years

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___!

Why you were admitted to the hospital:
- You were having pain in your side, back, hip and groin

What happened while you were here:
- Infectious work up was unremarkable - specifically you had no 
infection in your urine or testicles 
- There was concern for a kidney stone though imaging did not 
show this so it was felt to be less likely
- MRI of your back showed narrowing and pressure on the nerves, 
which was felt to be the cause of your pain 
- Orthopedic spine surgery and the pain service were consulted 
and assisted with pain management
- Additionally, you had significant fluid overload (fluid in 
your lungs), requiring oxygen and repeat dialysis sessions 
- Lab tests showed that there was additional stress on your 
heart. You should continue taking your heart medications as 
prescribed. 

What you should do once you leave the hospital:
- Please continue taking your medications as prescribed
- Please follow up at the appointments outlined below 

Sincerely,
Your ___ Care Team

Chief Complaint:
Hand and foot wounds
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is as ___ incarcerated male with ESRD
secondary to PCKD s/p failed kidney transplant in ___ and on HD
___, Hepatitis C (treated), HTN, hx of osteomyelitis/
endocarditis per chart review, and carotid stenosis who is
presenting with approximately 4 months of worsening bilateral
hand and unilateral foot pain swelling and skin breakdown. 

He reports no known antecedent trauma to his hands and his feet
but has had progressive pain and discoloration of two fingers on
his right hand, one finger on his left hand, and right big toe.
He reports trying to seek help earlier but was unable to get
medical attention at his ___ facility. The pain has
progressively gotten worse to now ___ pain, limiting his
ability to ambulate and use his hands.

Regarding his ulcers, per outpatient notes, Mr. ___ has a 
long
history of manipulative and self-injurious behavior. The wound 
on
the right hand started as a small cut likely from trimming his
finger nails. Without adequate wound care or dressing changes,
this progressed into a blister and then further progressed to 
the
necrotic lesion.

He had an ultrasound of the right subclavian to rule out 
thrombus
and an echo which showed no vegetations. ANCA panel and
cryoglobulins were negative. He had a period where the hand
became edematous and erythematous, with elevated ESR and CRP and
was treated with IV vanco and ceftaz with improvement in the
wound appearance, edema and erythema. Despite this, he continued
to be non-compliant with wound care.

He was seen by Vascular Surgery at ___ and on ___ an
arteriogram was done there showing:

The right subclavian artery axillary and brachial arteries were
all widely patent.  The right ulnar artery was the primary
outflow to the hand as the radial artery occluded in the distal
forearm.  On the left the subclavian axillary and brachial
arteries were all widely patent.  There was reversal of flow
distal to the fistula, the fistula filled very quickly.  With
fistula compression the ulnar artery had improved flow and was
the primary runoff to the hand as the radial artery occluded in
the mid forearm.  Of note, there was significant sluggish flow
throughout all of his vessels concerning for a possible central
source.

Dr. ___ performed the study, had no good explanation
for the very sluggish flow in this patient whose last EF was
normal. There were no treatable lesions as above.

Dr. ___, the transplant physician who has been managing his 
left upper extremity fistula, felt that ligating the fistula 
would be recommended in this setting to optimize flow to the 
left hand and help healing as much as possible, although patient 
has declined in the past. This may be an elective option in the 
future.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o male with a history of ESRD ___ PCKD s/p 
deceased donor renal transplant (___) c/b chronic allograft 
dysfunction, now back on HD since ___, HCV s/p Harvoni, and 
HTN who presented with bilateral digital ulcers, with imaging 
concerning for possible osteomyelitis. Broad workup sent to rule 
out vasculitic process and embolic source. Presentation 
ultimately thought secondary to peripheral vascular disease with 
associated dry gangrene of the digits.

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS: 

# Foot/Hand ulcers
# Concern for osteomyelitis
Patient presented with worsening pain, swelling, and necrotic 
changes of the R index/middle and L index fingers in the setting 
of progressively worsening chronic hand ischemia. Duration seems 
likely ___ months, as not noted on prior admission discharged in 
___. Per outpatient notes, injury was apparently incurred and 
resulted in worsening appearance and apparent concern for 
superinfection which was treated with IV Vanc/Ceftaz at ___ 
additionally, reportedly ANCA and Cryoglobulins were sent and 
were negative. When not improved, patient was sent to ___ 
where arteriogram shows sluggish flow without evidence of a flow 
limiting lesion. This may be seen in the presence of a central 
lesion or can also be seen in advanced heart failure, however EF 
was noted to be preserved. Broad differential was considered for 
decreased perfusion and vasculopathy including peripheral 
arterial disease, embolic (hypercoagulability, infectious, 
central lesion) vasculitis(small/medium/large vessel 
involvement, cryoglobulinemia) with work up unrevealing. He also 
underwent CTA chest which did not show a central lesion in his 
aorta. He had ABIs of the lower extremities which showed 
significant vascular occlusive disease. Calciphylaxis was 
considered, dermatology was consulted but thought unlikely given 
isolated involvement of fingertips. For potential benefit of 
increased perfusion via vasodilation, nifedipine was uptitrated. 
Tacrolimus was discontinued after discussion with renal given 
limited benefit to graft and known side effect of 
vasoconstriction. Admission radiographs concerning for R digit 
osteomyelitis and as such MR was obtained which was not fully 
completed, but did not show osteomyelitis. Repeat MRI was not 
pursued as hand surgery did not think it would change 
management. Vascular surgery and hand surgery were consulted. 
Vascular surgery did not recommend intervention. Hand surgery 
felt his presentation was most likely consistent with dry 
gangrene related to his peripheral vascular disease and the 
fingers would likely self-demarcate/self-amputate. Pain was 
aggressively controlled with OxyCODONE (Immediate Release) 15 mg 
PO Q8H:PRN Pain on discharge. He was also started on gabapentin 
100 mg daily as adjuvant medication which discussed with the 
nephrology team.

#Atypical pneumonia
Found to incidentally have multifocal opacities on CTA chest per 
above. He was asymptomatic without leukocytosis, fever, cough. 
Differential diagnosis for the opacities included vasculitis 
given the above workup, however was ultimately felt to be most 
consistent with an atypical pneumonia. He received azithromycin 

#ESRD ___ PCKD s/p DDRT ___ c/b chronic allograft dysfunction 
(antibody-mediated rejection ___, biopsy-confirmed chronic 
transplant glomerulopathy, interstitial fibrosis & tubular 
atrophy ___ 
Patient maintained on HD ___ schedule for dialysis. Discharge 
weight was around
148lb on prior admission. On admission 140lbs. Discharge weight

- Continued home nephrocap daily, Mg oxide 800mg daily, Calcium
Carbonate 500 mg PO BID, and Cinacalcet 30 mg PO DAILY, EPO shot 
once weekly, renal diet, fluid restriction 1.5L daily. 
Tacrolimus was discontinued given limited benefit to graft and 
known side effect of vasoconstriction. 

# Immunosuppression

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopaedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:
POD#2  Tm 102.9 overnight (11pm)), UA sent which was negative, 
no further fever workup pursued given pod#1 and has not been 
using IS nor ambulating much.  No pulmonary sx, no urinary sx, 
likely atelectasis and continued to monitor closely.
POD#3 was tachycardic to Tm 101.9 at 3am, tachy to 114, 95%2L 
denied sob/pleuritic chest pain, reported that uses O2 at home 
sometimes, no urinary sx, reports ear pain, no calf pain. 
Incision c/d/i with small area of ecchymosis/erythema.  
Cxr/ua/blood cultures ordered with close monitoring for any 
changes in symptoms and to determine need for further workup 
with PE CT if does not improve given fever/tachy/O2 requirement 
overnight. Also received 1u prbc for drop in hematocrit.
POD#4 Tachycardia improved s/p prbc transfusion, decreased O2 
requirement overnight, afebrile, chest x-ray shows decreased 
lung volume, ua negative. Remained afebrile and asymptomatic 
with no further O2 requirement throughout day, was mildly 
somnolent, but A&Ox3 and easily arousable.  Incision c/d/i with 
___ erythema. Otherwise pain well controlled and no 
acute symptoms 

Otherwise, pain was initially controlled with a PCA followed by 
a transition to oral pain medications on POD#1.  The patient 
received lovenox for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of 
POD#1.  The foley was removed on POD#2 and the patient was 
voiding independently thereafter. The surgical dressing was 
changed on POD#2 and the surgical incision was found to be clean 
and intact without erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient 
was seen daily by physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout 
the hospital course and repleted accordingly. At the time of 
discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling 
well.  The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The 
patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately 
controlled on an oral regimen. The operative extremity was 
neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign. 

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as 
tolerated on the operative extremity.
 

Ms. ___ is discharged to home with services/rehab in 
stable condition.

CXR ___  
Right lower lobe focal opacity which could be pneumonia in the 
proper clinical setting.  Repeat after treatment suggested to 
document resolution. 

TTE ___
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal 
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). 
Doppler parameters are indeterminate for left ventricular 
diastolic function. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, 
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and 
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve 
leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is an 
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. 

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved regional/global systolic 
function.

Brief Hospital Course:
PATIENT SUMMARY
___ year old woman with a PMH DM, HTN, HLD, Asthma, and multiple 
abdominal surgeries after a complicated oophorectomy, who 
presents with 2 weeks worsening epigastric pain and acute kidney 
injury. She was resuscitated with fluids with subsequent 
resolution of ___. Given persistent abdominal pain concerning 
for PUD vs gastritis, she underwent endoscopy on ___ which 
showed patchy erythema. Biopsies were taken, and she was 
discharged with close GI and PCP ___. 

ACUTE ISSUES:
===============
#Abdominal Pain, possible dyspepsia
Patient presented with 2 weeks of epigastric pain, worse with 
meals, unrelieved by PPI therapy. She has a prolonged history of 
abdominal
surgeries following an oophorectomy with subsequent sigmoid 
perforation. On admission, CT showed no evidence SBO or 
pathology at her previous anastomosis. She was empirically 
treated with IV antibiotics over concern for intraabdominal 
infection. However, she remained afebrile with no leukocytosis, 
with overall low concern for infection, so antibiotics were 
stopped upon arrival to the floor. Recal occult blood test was 
negative. Her pain is likely secondary to gastritis vs peptic 
ulcer disease. 

GI was consulted for endoscopy given her history of gastritis 
and failure of a PPI trial. Endoscopy was performed on ___ and 
showed patchy erythema. Biopsies were taken, and patient will 
follow up in GI clinic with Dr. ___ (fellow). Her home 
omeprazole 20 mg PO BID was continued. Dicyclomine was changed 
to four times a day. H. pylori antibody testing was negative.

#Acute kidney injury
Creatinine was 2.3 on admission, likely secondary to pre-renal 
zotemia, ___ to hypovolemia in the setting of poor po intake 
from continued abdominal pain. Her Creatinine was 1.0 on 
discharge. Furosemide was held on admission and at discharge. 
Lisinopril was held on admission and restarted at discharge. 

CHRONIC PROBLEMS
================
# Pancytopenia: Stable throughout admission. 

# HTN: Furosemide was held on admission and at discharge. 
Lisinopril was held on admission and restarted at discharge. 

# HLD: Home simvastatin was continued.

# Chronic back pain: Gabapentin was continued at reduced renal 
dose until resolution of ___. Tylenol and Tramadol were given 
PRN.

========
CT Neck w/ contrast ___:
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. Partially visualized complex right suboccipital fluid without
complete rim enhancement, surrounded by soft tissue density, at
the site of prior subcutaneous edema.  This suggests a 
developing, though not fully formed abscess. 
2. Mildly enlarged, morphologically normal left lower posterior 
triangle/supraclavicular lymph nodes, contralateral from the
right suboccipital fluid collection, are most likely reactive,
but of uncertain etiology. 

CT HEAD W CONTRAST ___  
1. Scalp edema in the right occiput concerning for cellulitis. 
No
evidence of fluid collection or soft tissue gas.  
2. No acute intracranial abnormality.

Patient presented with ___ of worsening occipital scalp
tenderness and swelling, found to have a 3-4cm area consistent 
with cellulitis. Patient was febrile to 102.7 in the ED, 
otherwise was without leukocytosis (neutrophilic predominant, no 
bands). Given signs of possible systemic toxicity (fever, 
borderline BP upon arrival to the floor), continued MRSA in 
addition to strep coverage with vancomycin which was then 
transitioned to cefazolin.  Additionally, due to persistent 
fever on antibiotics as well as neck pain, a CT neck, and torso 
were obtained which showed emerging abcess. Abscess developed 
with purulent discharge. ACS was consulted and she underwent 
I&D. A She did well and antibiotics were narrowed to cephalexin 
to complete ten day course from day of I&D, end date ___. 

#NAUSEA AND ABDOMINAL PAIN:

additional GERD/gastritis (taking meloxicam daily). No BM for 
over 24 hours upon admission. The patient complained of 
worsening abdominal distention with associated nausea/emesis. 
Etiologies considered were bowel obstruction vs. PUD vs. 
evolving gastritis vs. SBP with known history of NASH +/- 
cirrhosis. Of note, patient was admitted ___ with abdominal 
pain and nausea/vomiting, symptoms thought to be related to 
gastritis/PUD. RUQUS without e/o ascites. KUB without evidence 
of ileus or obstruction. The morning that the day team picked up 
the patient, her abdominal exam was significantly improved and 
she only had mild tenderness to palpation. There were no further 
issues with this. 

#ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY:  
Cr was previously ~1, though increased to 1.3 ___ iso ED 
presentation for N/V/D. Suspected prerenal iso GI losses and 
poor PO intake, exacerbated by ongoing ACE-I and furosemide 
administration. No signs of UTI on UA. s/p 3L IVF in ED. Held

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

   It was a pleasure looking after you.  As you know, you were 
admitted with dizziness and back pain.  You were found to have a 
urinary tract infection which likely involved your kidney as 
well.  This may partly account for your back pain.   You were 
treated with intravenous antibiotics and switched to oral 
antibiotics once the urine cultures identified the bacteria 
(E.coli) and confirmed its sensitivity to the antibiotic you are 
being prescribed.
   
   Please complete the antibiotics (Cefpodoxime) for an 
additional 8 days to complete a 10 day course.  Otherwise, to 
avoid future urinary tract infection, please ensure that you are 
well hydrated and that your diabetes is in good control.  This 
will prevent future urinary tract infections from happening.  

 You were also found to be dehydrated and with mild acute kidney 
injury.  After hydration, your kidney function improved.  Please 
insure good oral intake of fluids and good control of sugars 
(higher sugars can lead to loss of water). 

 You may have a component of musculoskeletal back pain too.  For 
this, we recommend following with your medical doctor and taking 
acetaminophen (Tylenol) as needed. 

There are otherwise, no changes to your medication.  We wish you 
a quick recovery!

Your ___ team.

Studies: 
___ CXR
SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST 
REASON FOR EXAM:  Acute shortness of breath, followup pulmonary 
edema. 
Comparison is made with prior study, ___. 
There are persistent low lung volumes.  Mild cardiomegaly is 
stable.  
Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema has minimally improved.  Right 
perihilar 
opacities consistent with atelectasis are unchanged.  If any, 
there are small bilateral pleural effusions. There is a large 
hiatal hernia. 

___ CXR
FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the endotracheal 
and nasogastric tubes have been removed.  The right IJ catheter 
again extends into the right atrium. Continued low lung volumes 
with stable cardiomediastinal silhouette. Bilateral multifocal 
opacifications persist, though in some areas appear less 
prominent than on the prior study.  Bilateral pleural effusions 
with bibasilar volume loss persist, with poor definition of the 
left hemidiaphragm. 

___ CXR 
FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are 
unchanged in 
position, including a nasogastric tube coiled within a hiatal 
hernia and a 
right internal jugular vascular catheter with tip overlying the 
region of the body of the right atrium.  Cardiomediastinal 
contours are stable in 
appearance.  Lung volumes remain low.  Worsening multifocal 
pulmonary 
opacities, particularly within the right upper lobe and left 
lower lobe, but some improved aeration within the right lower 
lobe as compared to the priorstudy.  Small bilateral pleural 
effusions are unchanged on the left and minimally improved on 
the right. 

___ ECHO
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are 
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to 
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality 
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is probably mildly to moderately depressed (LVEF= 40 
%). There is LV dysynchrony (bundle branch block). No masses or 
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular 
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size is normal with 
borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. 
Mild to moderate (___) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial 
effusion.

___ CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in 
position including nasogastric tube coiled within a hiatal 
hernia.  Heart is mildly enlarged, accompanied by mild pulmonary 
vascular congestion.  Multifocal pulmonary opacities are again 
demonstrated in the right mid and both lower lungs, which may 
reflect a combination of multifocal atelectasis and infectious 
consolidation.  Overall, this has slightly worsened in the 
interval.  Small pleural effusions are also noted. 
 
___ CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 3 cm 
above the carina.  A right internal jugular central line has its 
tip in the right atrium  unchanged.  Nasogastric tube is seen 
within a hiatal hernia.  There is  persistent more confluent 
opacity in the right upper lobe, medial right lung  base and 
left lower lobe, all of which is concerning for multifocal 
pneumonia  or aspiration, less likely atelectasis.  Persistent 
small left effusion.   Overall stable cardiac and mediastinal 
contours.  Biliary stent remains in  place.  No pneumothorax.  
 
___ CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  
Right internal jugular central line continues to have its tip in 
the right atrium.  Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 4 
cm above the carina.  A  nasogastric tube is seen coursing below 
the diaphragm with the tip projecting  over the stomach.  
Biliary stent in place.  Low lung volumes. There has been  no 
significant interval change in the patchy airspace consolidation 
in the  periphery of the right upper lung and perihilar region 
concerning for  pneumonia.  In addition, persistent retrocardiac 
opacity is seen with  associated small left effusion which could 
reflect a partial lower lobe  atelectasis, although pneumonia or 
aspiration is also possible.  Clinical  correlation is advised. 
Overall stable cardiac and mediastinal contours. Scattered air 
in non-distended loops of predominantly small bowel.  No  
pneumothorax. 
  
___ CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
Interval placement of orogastric tube in standard position seen 
within the fundus of the stomach.  Interval improvement in 
pulmonary edema. Persistent left lower lobe atelectasis or 
collapse and persistent pneumonia  predominantly in the axillary 
region of the right lung. 
 
___ CTA ABD & PELVIS
1.  Large amount of blood within the abdomen, greatest around 
the liver with increased density along the liver consistent with 
more recent bleed, but no evidence of active arterial 
extravasation.  
2.  Hypodensity in the periphery of the right lobe of the liver, 
possibly consistent with contusion. 
3.  Patchy ground-glass opacities within the lungs bilaterally, 
right greater than left, suggest infection versus inflammation. 
4.  Bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis. 
 
___ ERCP
Findings: Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal 
Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal 
Duodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal 
Major Papilla: Normal major papilla 
Cannulation:  Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and 
deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. Contrast 
medium was injected resulting in partial opacification. 
Cannulation of the pancreatic duct was successful and 
superficial with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. 
Contrast medium was injected resulting in partial opacification. 
 
 
Fluoroscopic Interpretation of Biliary Tree: The common bile 
duct, common hepatic duct, right and left hepatic ducts were 
grossly normal. Given cholangitis, high pressure detailed 
cholangiogram was not performed.  
Procedures: A 7cm by ___ ___ biliary stent was placed 
successfully using a Oasis system stent introducer kit.  
 
Impression: (cannulation, cannulation) 
Limited cholangiogram showed a normal biliary tree. given 
cholangitis, detailed cholangiogram was not performed. A biliary 
stent was emperically placed. No pus was seen. 
(stent placement) 
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum
 
Recommendations: Watch for complications - bleeding , 
perforation, pancreatitis. Repeat ERCP in 1 month for assessment 
of biliary tree and stent removal. Return to ICU.
 
    
___ CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
Cardiac size is top normal.  There are low lung volumes.  
Widened mediastinum  could be due to the projection.  ET tube 
tip is 5 cm above the carina.   Multifocal consolidations in the 
right lung are worrisome for aspiration  pneumonia.  There is a 
large area of atelectasis in the left lower lobe.   There are 
small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no evident  
pneumothorax.  There are low lung volumes.  The stomach is 
distended. 
 
___ ECG 
Baseline artifact. Regular supraventricular rhythm. P wave 
difficult to assess in the limb leads. Left bundle-branch block. 
No previous tracing available for comparison. Clinical 
correlation is suggested. 
 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY OF ICU COURSE PER ICU TEAM:
==================================
___ w chronic thrombocytopenia, thrombophilia s/p lap CCY 
___ for porcelain ___ transferred from OSH with postop 
multiorgan dysfunction syndrome in setting of postoperative 
hemorrhage with hemoperitoneum, sepsis ___ cholangitis vs 
aspiration PNA/ HCAP. 
 
ACTIVE ISSUES in ICU: 

# Septic and hypovolemic shock: On transfer from OSH, patient 
met criteria for severe sepsis given multisystem organ 
dysfunction (elevated LFTs, poor UOP, rising creatinine, 
hypoxia). Most likely infectious sources are 
gallbladder/cholangitis given recent surgery vs. pulmonary given 
new infiltrates on CXR and multiple ground glass opacities on 
subsequent CT scan. Other possible sources are urine, peripheral 
IV lines. Currently on phenylephrine to maintain pressures. 
Patient was started on emperic vancomycin and zosyn (day 1 = 
___ to cover for possible biliary or lung sources. Blood, 
urine and sputum cultures were sent and are negative or pending 
as of ___ at 1644. Hypovolemia was also likely contributing 
to hypotension in the context of acute blood loss anemia with CT 
showing large amount of blood within the abdomen, greatest 
around the liver with increased density along the liver 
consistent with more recent bleed, but no evidence of active 
arterial extravasation.  Central line was placed as patient 
required phenylephrine. This was subsequently weaned and patient 
became hypertensive and tachycardic requiring IV nitro drip 
which was also weaned. Thereafter patient was hemodynamically 
stable for transfer to the medical floor where her pressure 
remained stable. 
 
# Respiratory Failure: Patient was intubated for airway 
protection prior to transfer to the ___. Patient was sedated 
with fentanyl and midazolam boluses. Did not complete RSBI 
evaluation on ___ given hypertension, diaphoresis, and patient 
discomfort. She was diuresed and SBT/RSBI were repeated on ___ 
and ___, and patient was successfully extubated. After 
extubation, patient endorsed visual hallucination of ants 
crawling on the wall and appeared to have a hypoactive delerium, 
which was moderately improved by time of transfer from the FICU. 
She had one further episode of wheezing prior to transfer. She 
received nebs and expectorated mucus, after which she improved. 
There was no desaturation. She was back to baseline prior to 
transfer to medical floor.  Respiratory status on floor 
complicated by acute systolic heart failure, as below.
  
# Anemia, thrombocytopenia: She has MDS by ___ with deletion 
20q and intermediate-1 risk. Baseline Hct is normal (40 on 
___ and baseline plts are ~40s.  At OSH in the PACU, patient 
was hypotensive with hct of 21 following elective 
cholecystectomy from 37 pre-op.  Transferred to ICU w pressor 
requirement.  Received 4 pRBC w hct 18 ___ ___ -> 32 ___ 
AM).  On arrival to ___ hct of 22 and she received a total of 
4 units pRBCs on ___ and hematocrit increased to 30.5. 
Likely acute blood loss anemia as patient had CT scan which 
revealed large amounts of blood within the abdomen, greatest 
around the liver with increased density along the liver 
consistent with more recent bleed. 
 
# ___: Creatine 1.8 on arrival from. Likely secondary to poor 
perfusion from sepsis as above. Her urine lytes consistent with 
pre-renal etiology with FENa of 0.41%. Patient was volume 
repleted and received multiple units of pRBCs and creatinine 
trended to baseline of 0.6-0.7.  
 
# Thrombocytopenia: Long-standing per notes. Bone marrow biopsy 
in the past was not diagnostic. Platelets have been dropping at 
OSH which may be in the setting of acute illness vs. waxing and 
waning at baseline, however given recent Lovenox (started to 
bridge several days pre-op) there was initially concern for HIT, 
though outpatient hematologist ___ felt there was 
no concern for HIT in this setting.
 
# History of DVT/PE: Spoke with outpatient hematologist 
___ (___) who confirms prothrombin gene 
mutation with multple DVT/PE and need for ongoing 
anticoagulation. She take warfarin, but this was held and she 
was on lovenox pre-operatively. She has MDS by ___ with 
deletion 20q and intermediate-1 risk. Baseline Hct is normal (40 
on ___ and baseline plts are ~40s. She is not concerned for 
HIT in this setting. Given acute blood loss anemia (above) 
warfarin and lovenox were held and she was started on heparin SC 
for DVT prophylaxis. On ___, hematology recommended holding 
all heparin products and sending HIT antibody. HIT antibody was 
pending at the time of transfer out of the FICU.--> Heparin PF4 
Antibody Test by ___ was negative.
 
 
# Hypothyroidism: Stable. Continued home levothyroxine. 
 
# ? Hypertension: Metoprolol held initially in the setting of 
hypotension as above. 
 
# Hyperlipidemia: Statin held in setting of rising LFTs, with 
concern for shock liver. AST and ALT subsequently trended down. 
 
# Communication: Sister ___ ___

=====================================
SUMMARY OF COURSE WHILE ON GENERAL MEDICAL SERVICE:
___ yo woman with MDS, prothrombin gene mutation, multiple DVT, 
PE, s/p elective lap CCY at OSH on ___ for porcelain GB (path 
showed no malignancy per phone call to ___ on ___. Postop 
course c/b hypotension, hemoperitoneum, hypoxia requiring 
intubation, ARF, elevated transaminases. She was med-flighted 
from ___ to the ICU at the ___ on ___ and 
underwent an ERCP on ___ with biliary stent placement.  She 
stabilized on pressors, IVF, 4U PRBCs, empiric zosyn/vanco for 
HCAP +/- cholangitis, and ultimately was weaned from pressors, 
extubated and finished an 8-day course of abx. 
.
Hematology saw patient in the ICU given h/o MDS, 
thrombocytopenia, and thrombophilia (DVT/PE). They recommended 
restarting warfarin when plt >25K.  Her Hct remained stable in 
the low ___ x several days & she was hemodynamically stable, 
thus warfarin was restarted ___ (5 mg po x 1, then 2 mg po 
___ with increase in INR to 2.7.  INR fell to 2.0 on ___, 
coumadin restarted at 2 mg daily. INR stable at 2.0 on ___. 
.
Her course on the floor was notable for persistent hypoxemia and 
relative tachypnea.  Her volume status has been difficult 
initially with copious CDiff neg diarrhea (now improved on 
loperamide).  On ___ she developed wheezing and was given a 
neb which 'worsened' her respiratory status, she was 
hypertensive, tachycardic, diaphoretic and had rales throughout 
c/w acute on chronic systolic heart failure.  Responded well to 
nitropaste, furosemide (40 mg IV x 1 after already receiving 20 
mg po earlier) and oxygen.  Of note, TTE earlier in 
hospitalization showed an EF 40% without clear wall motion 
abnormalities.  Afterload reduction was added with captopril.  
She was diuresed with IV lasix with improvement. She appeared 
euvolemic on ___, therefore lasix was stopped.  Captopril was 
added for afterload reduction, this should be changed to 
lisinopril at rehab.  She requires ongoing careful monitoring 
for volume status and may require addition lasix at rehab.  
Recommend repeat transthoracic echocardiogram in ___ weeks to 
reassess ventricular function for improvement after recovery 
from critical illness. 
.
She continues to have RUQ abdominal pain.  GI was consulted for 
this, and feel it is likely due to her large hemoperitoneum.  
Pain control achieved with oxycodone.  Patient with significant 
atelectesis due to pleuritic pain - working on pain control, 
incentive spirometry. 

OTHER ISSUES
## Acute on chronic systolic heart failure, EF 40% - unclear 
cause of cardiomyopathy (? sepsis v other), + pulmonary vascular 
congestion, bilateral pleural effusions.  Requires repeat TTE as 
outpatient, outpt cardiology eval if persistant. 

## Resolving Multifocal PNA/Aspiration PNA +/- TRALI.  Still 
with hypoxia / ___ O2 requirement at discharge.  Encourage 
incentive spirometry.   

## Recovering from septic and hemorrhagic shock s/p 8 days 
vanc/pip/tazobactam, shock liver/ischemic insult to hepatic 
parenchyma

## s/p CCY for porcelain gallbladder

## thrombophilia - prothrombin gene mutation with DVT/PEs in 
past on chronic warfarin therapy - will require careful INR 
monitoring at rehab due to malnutrition leading to labile INRs

## myelodysplasia syndrome - should follow up with heme upon 
discharge from rehab

## mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension - stable

## Moderate mitral regurgitation, mild-moderate aortic 
insufficiency

## hypothyroidism - stable

## Acute blood loss anemia - stable

## marked deconditioning - requires ___ / OT

## mild malnutrition - appetite poor, in part due to 
hemoperitoneum. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
## Patient requires f/u ERCP, scheduled for ___ to remove 
stent in CBD
## monitor BUN/Cr/Potassium carefully given diuresis and 
recently started ACE-i.  Captopril was added for afterload 
reduction, consider uptitration and changing to  lisinopril at 
rehab.
## monitor INR / coumadin dosing carefully given malnutrition
## She requires ongoing careful monitoring for volume status and 
may require addition lasix at rehab. 
## Patient will require workup to investigate cause of 
cardiomyopathy.  Recommend repeat transthoracic echocardiogram 
in ___ weeks to reassess ventricular function for improvement 
after recovery from critical illness. 
## restart oral iron therapy (stopped in-house due to bowel 
issues)

Brief Hospital Course:
___ admitted for abdominal pain secondary to perihepatic/pelvic 
fluid collections after undergoing elective laparoscopic 
cholecystectomy at OSH on ___.  Upon admission her INR was 
2.4, and her platelets 27, so on ___ she was unable to undergo 
drainage as her anticoagulated state needed to be reversed and 
her platelets restored.  To this end, she was given vitamin K, a 
heparin drip started at 600 units/hr for a PTT goal of 50-70, 
and she was scheduled to undergo drainage on ___, which she 
did.  She tolerated the procedure well, and her regular diet was 
resumed.  On ___, she was evaluated by a nutritionist after 
she stated that she had not been eating well; they recommended 
Ensure daily with meals. Her albumin came back as 3.1. On 
___, she had a HIDA scan that showed ""no evidence of bile 
leak or biliary obstruction. Surgically absent gallbladder"". 

On ___, the patient's pelvic drain was removed due to 
minimal drainage, and the culture and gram stain of the fluid 
was negative for bacterial growth. Blood cultures were also 
negative. Antibiotics were discontinued at this time.   

On ___, the patient was transfused with one unit of 
platelets in order to undergo a previously scheduled ERCP for 
stent removal. She tolerated the procedure without any 
complications: ""The prior placed plastic stent was removed using 
a snare. Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep 
with a balloon catheter using a free-hand technique.  The 
intrahepatics were normal. The common bile duct was normal in 
size. Small filling defects seen in the common bile duct. The 
cystic duct stump was visualized along with RUQ surgical clips 
from the prior cholecystectomy. Sludge was extracted 
successfully using a extraction balloon. An occlusion 
cholangiogram showed no further filling defects. There was 
excellent flow of bile and contrast.""   

After her procedure, her heparin gtt was held for 6 hours and 
she was discharged back to ___ with plan to restart 
her heparin gtt at 1700 pm (___). She was started back on 
her coumadin as well in order to obtain a therapeutic INR level. 
She was discharged on ___ with scheduled followup in the 
___.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o female with history of prothrombin gene mutation, 
multiple DVT/PE on coumadin and thrombocytopenia likely due to 
MDS who presented with thrombocytopenia found on routine blood 
work and GUAIAC positive stool.

Thromboctopenia: No evidence of acute bleeding. PTL here were 18 
and 9 at ___. Coumadin held. Case discussed with primary 
hematologist who recommended there is no need to transfuse if 
patient is not bleeding and platelets are greater than 3. On the 
day of discharge platelet count was 16.

GUAIAC positive dark stool: concern for GIB in ED, but has 
hemorrhoids, hemodynamically stable. H/H above baseline and 
remained stable during admission. Sx likely hemorrhoidal in 
setting of low PTL and therapeutic INR.

DVT/PE on coumadin: will resume coumadin when PTL>25. No need to 
reverse INR

Thrombophlebitis: found at site of midline PICC. Line removed, 
tip cultured. Results pending.

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker 
or cane).

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted due to a low platelet count. On repeat testing 
your platelet count was slightly higher. On discussion with your 
hematologist it was decided that there was no need to transfuse 
platelets as you were not bleeding.
There was also concern that you might be bleeding from your 
colon however your blood counts remained stable. The trace 
amount of blood found in your stool is most likely due to 
hemorrhoids and the dark color of your stool is due to the iron 
pills you take. 
Also during your stay the site of your mid-line PICC became 
painful. It was removed and the catheter was cultured to look 
for infection. Those results remain pending at the time of 
discharge but the preliminary results are negative.

previous tracing available for comparison.  

IMAGING:
NONCONTRAST HEAD CT:
There is no intracranial hemorrhage. The gray-white matter 
differentiation is preserved. There is no edema or mass effect. 
The 
ventricles are prominent in size consistent with age-related 
atrophic changes. 
Periventricular white matter hypodensities are consistent with 
small vessel ischemic disease. A focal hypodensity within the 
right basal ganglia likely represents a chronic lacune. 
Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. 

MRI/A HEAD AND NECK:
Area of subacute ischemia is identified involving the 
postero-lateral aspect of the left thalamus as described in 
detail above, 
visualized on the ADC, T2 and FLAIR sequences. 
  
Chronic microvascular ischemic changes with associated cortical 
volume loss as described in detail above. 
  
The area of ischemia also is involving the lateral aspect of the 
left 
thalamus. 

Limited examination with possible arteriosclerotic changes and 
narrowing of the distal branches of the MCA as described above. 
The left 
vertebral artery is patent as well as the basilar artery; 
however, the right vertebral artery is not clearly identified, 
possibly terminating in ___.  Hypoplasia of the A1 segment on 
the right is identified. 

CXR
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms ___ is a ___ year-old R-handed woman with
history of Alzheimer's dementia who presents with a 1 day 
history

the right
side, overshooting on the right, rebound on the right, as well 
as
continued difficulties with ambulation with falling onto the the
right side.  Her NCHCT was negative for any acute processes
without any overt evidence of ischemia. Due to concern for 
stroke, she was admitted to neurology. MRI showed acute left 
thalamic infarct. MRA showed diffuse atherosclerosis with 
narrowing in distal MCAs but without any significant occlusive 
disease. The etiology of this small stroke is likely small 
vessel disease. The patient underwent a stroke workup including 
echocardiogram, toxic/metabolic studies, ___.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the 
operating room on ___ where the patient underwent AVR (25mm 
tissue), MVrepair (32mm ring), and Ascending Aorta Replacement 
(28mm gelweave graft) with Dr. ___.  Overall the patient 
tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was 
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and 
invasive monitoring. POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert 
and oriented and breathing comfortably.  The patient was 
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic 
or vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the 
patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The 
patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further 
recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued 
without complication.  Free water was restricted for mild 
hyponatremia, which improved prior to discharge.  He had a brief 
episode of rapid Atrial Fibrillation, which converted to SR with 
IV lopressor and titration of Atenolol. 
The patient complained of nausea and ""wretching"".  SLP evaluated 
the patient and he passed the swallow study without difficulty.  
The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for 
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge 
on POD 5 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was 
healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The

IMAGING: 
CXR ___
FINDINGS: Two views were obtained of the chest.  Improved small 
right and 
unchanged moderate left pleural effusions are accompanied by 
basal 
atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  Moderate 
cardiomegaly is mildly decreased from previous examination with 
intact sternotomy wires and valvuloplasty ring noted. 
IMPRESSION: Decrease in size of small right and unchanged 
moderate left  
pleural effusion with accompanying bibasilar atelectasis. 

pCXR ___
Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison 
to ___.  Cardiomegaly is severe, unchanged.  Left 
retrocardiac consolidation and pleural effusion are unchanged.  
Lungs are essentially clear at the upper and mid portions.  No 
pneumothorax is demonstrated.

___ TTE 
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is 
markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left The left atrium 
is moderately dilated. The right atrium is markedly dilated. 
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal 
cavity size. There is moderate to severe global left ventricular 
hypokinesis (LVEF = 25 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the 
left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased 
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right 
ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild global free wall 
hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus 
level. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The 
aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet 
motion and transvalvular gradients. A mitral valve annuloplasty 
ring is present. The mitral annular ring appears well seated 
with normal gradient. An eccentric, jet of mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure is high normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal 
cavity size and global hypokinesis Normal functioning aortic 
valve bioprosthesis and mitral valve repair. Dilated aortic 
sinus.

 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ s/p recent surgical AVR, MV repair and asending aorta 
replacement discharged on high dose furosemide now admitted with 
hypovolemia, hypotension and afib with RVR not responsive to 
metoprolol, but rate controlled with atenolol and sotalol.

# Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular 
response: 
High dose Metoprolol 100 mg po TID was ineffective at rate 
control. So was started on atenolol 50 mg po BID and sotalol. 
His QTc stayed 440-470 on sotalol. He had brief episodes of HR 
dropping to the ___ due to concealed PACs. Atenolol was 
decreased to 25 mg po BID.

Patient started on warfarin this admission, received nutrition 
education for warfarin. INR will be followed by Dr. ___.

# Arrythmia: concealed PACs which blocked at AV node and sinus 
giving bradycardia. Dose of atenolol decreased. Pt also had 2.2 
sec run of WCT (6 beats, CL 400ms). No Sx. Will follow with Dr. 
___.

# Hyponatremia: Most likely from daily furosemide use vs 
hypovolemic hyponatremia as improved with IVF and improvement of 
hypotension, but then downtrended slightly with increased dose 
of furosemide.

# Leukocytosis: Noted to have WBC 17K at rehabilitation, which 
continued to downtrend until normal this admission without 
antibiotics. Urine cultures and chest xray as well as blood 
cultures were unrevealing. No diarrhea noted to suggest c. diff. 
Surgical incision without signs of infection.  

# CHF: He was not volume overloaded at admission. In fact, he 
was dehydrated due to increase in dose of diuretics at rehab in 
the week prior to admission. CHF and decline in LV systolic 
function was indication to replace AVR. Dry weight at discharge 
is 157 lbs. Attention to whether he needs diuretic and at what 
dose will be done as outpatient as he resolves ___ space pleural 
fluid in the post-op course. Systolic blood pressures were in 
the ___ this admission, so ACEI or spironolactone were not 
added to regimen.

# Cough: Most likely viral URI with post nasal drip causing 
cough, but also possibly from GERD, atelectasis, or URI. Given 
prolonged sx and constellation of symptoms, did not suspect 
influenza. CXR showed left post surgical pleural effusion and 
bibasilar atelectasis. Patient was afebrile throughout admission 
and leukocytosis resolved without intervention. He was treated 
with benzonatate and guaifenesin cough syrup. 

# Recent cardiac surgery: Wound appeared clean and dry, no sign 
of infection, bypass access sites with healing ecchymosis  as 
well. Cardiac surgery made aware of admission, Mr. ___ has 
outpatient follow up with them. 

# GERD: continued PPI. There was a report of guaiac positive 
brown stool from rehabilitation center when he was not on 
warfarin. CBC was stable, no bloody or melanotic stools 
observed. Stool guiac near end of admission when he was on 
warfarin was negative for occult blood.

# Elevated TSH: ___ sick euthyroid picture gien recent cardiac 
surgery. Will have outpatient follow up after recovery from 
acute illness/recent surgery

# Nutrition: iron supplement

# Anxiety: lorazepam 0.5mg PO daily prn

# Insomnia: zolpidem 5mg QHS prn

# Rehab: HE was able to walk 60+ feet on level ground and climb 
1 flight of stairs. He should continue walking and stairs 
exercise at home. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Started warfarin for atrial fibrillation. INR to be followed 
by Dr. ___ on discharge with coumadin dose adjusted 
to achieve INR in ___ range.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your 
hospitalization. You were admitted because your feeding tube was 
clogged, and because your liver doctor was very concerned about 
you drinking alcohol again. Your feeding tube was replaced, and 
tube feeds were restarted. 

We strongly encourage you to not drink alcohol again, as this 
will quickly cause your liver disease to worsen, and could lead 
to death. If you feel like you need extra support, please 
contact your primary care physician. You should strongly 
consider joining ___ rehab to help you treat alcoholism.

We wish you the best of luck in your health.

Sincerely,
Your ___ Care Team

___ after falling, and sustaining a large hematoma 
requiring surgical evacuation, who is transferred to ___ for 
advanced care.  
 Prior to her admission at ___, she had been drinking much more 
heavily for 3 weeks. During those 3 weeks, she was drinking 1 
pint of vodka daily. Prior to that, she had been drinking 1 pint 
of vodka daily, ___ days per week. She does not identify any

given the risk. Transaminases trended up, then down, then back 
up (though trend not available in records).  
 - Imaging showed new, small ascites (not tapped)  
 - Given fever and elevated transaminases, alcoholic hepatitis 
was considered. ___ DF score = 45. Prednisolone therapy 
not initiated, given concern for adherence upon discharge.  
 - Initial urinalysis was grossly positive. No treatment 
documented, though repeat urinalysis 5 days later showed clean 
urine.  
 - MRCP showed no obstruction  
 - She also had ileus/small bowel obstruction on imaging, with 
diarrhea, which was attributed to pain medication. C. difficle 
PCR was negative.  
 - Hematomas remained stable; she received 12 u pRBC, DDAVP x3, 
as well as transfusions of FFP and vitamin K to lower the INR, 
which was unsuccessful (INR initially elevated to 1.6)  
 - She was noted to be febrile, without leukocytosis; attributed 
to blood product transfusion. She was given clindamycin x48 
hours.  
 - TSH was elevated to 7.3, due to noncompliance. Levothyroxine 
was restarted.  
 - She had waxing/waning periods of visual hallucinations and 
decreased competency. She did attempt to leave AMA at one point, 
so PICC line was removed.

IMAGES/STUDIES
==================
___ Preliminary EEG reading: no epileptiform discharges, no 
seizures, mild encephalopathy seen

___ Portal CXR: In comparison with study of ___, there 
is an placement of a Dobhoff tube, the opaque tip of which 
straddles the esophagogastric junction.  The tube should be 
pushed forward about 10 cm to be in a more optimal position. No 
evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.

___ Portable Abdomen: There are a few small bowel loops 
measuring top-normal in size.  Gas is seen in the distal large 
bowel.  No air-fluid levels are visualized on left lateral 
decubitus view.  There is no free intraperitoneal air.Osseous 
structures are unremarkable. There are no unexplained soft 
tissue calcifications or radiopaque foreign bodies.
 
IMPRESSION: 
Nonspecific bowel gas pattern.  No definite ileus or 
obstruction.

___ Tibia/Fibula Left Xray: There is some soft tissue edema 
in the left calf.  This is most marked laterally.  There is no 
evidence of fracture.  No bone destruction.  No embedded 
radiopaque foreign body is seen. 

___ CXR:The lungs are clear.  Heart size is top normal. No 
focal consolidations are seen.  No pneumothorax, pleural 
effusions, or pulmonary edema. 

___ CT lower extremity: Soft tissue collection at the dorsal 
aspect of the foot, likely representing a hematoma. Navicular 
cuboid developmental coalition with reactive changes at the 
synostosis. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ year old woman with alcoholic cirrhosis and 
alcohol abuse who presented to an OSH with a large hematoma 
after sustaining a fall, with anemia, as well as alcoholic 
hepatitis and further decompensation of her liver cirrhosis, is 
transferred to ___ for further care.   
 
#TRAUMATIC HEMATOMAS: patient sustained a large left hematoma on 
her left thigh as well as a deeper small lesion on the right 
foot, per history due to falling while inebriated. Both areas 
were tender to palpation and warm to touch, but there was no 
evidence of increase in size. There was no evidence of deep 
venous thrombosis. Patient was initially followed by the 
Orthopedics team, and then followed by the Plastics team, who 
debrided the right foot and recommended conservative wound care 
management and discharge on a wound vac. There was surrounding 
erythema and pain over the foot lesion, and given its open 
nature, she was initially covered on vancomycin and ceftriaxone, 
especially given fevers noted on ___. Patient did well on IV 
antibiotics with which she remained afebrile with stable vital 
signs, and was transitioned to PO Cephalexin for a 10 day total 
course for presumed soft tissue infection. Patient to follow up 
with outpatient Plastics clinic. 

#SEIZURE: Patient had a reported partially witnessed episode of 
shaking of both upper and lower extremities of unclear etiology 
or trigger. She has a prior history of seizures, and has been on 
Keppra as a home medication although with no recent neurologic 
followup. Her electrolytes were stable, with no recurrence of 
the episode. She was placed on 24 hour EEG monitoring, with 
preliminary results were negative for epileptiform changes, 
showing some minor encephalopathy. Patient's mental status 
remained stable and she was discharged with no new medication 
changes.

#NAUSEA: patient reported continued nausea during the course of 
the hospitalization, infectious workup revealing, with no 
notable new medications. High dose opioids were avoided, and 
symptoms seemed to be from prolonged poor nutrition. Her 
symptoms mildly improved after placement of Doboff tube for 
nutrition. Nausea was controlled with ondansetron and compazine 
as needed. 

#LIVER CIRRHOSIS, WITH CONCERN FOR DECOMPENSATION: MELD-Na on 
admission to ___ 27, was approximately 34 during her course. 
Possible factors inciting decompensation included alcoholic 
hepatitis, infection, anemia (patient had hgb 5.4 on admission 
to OSH and required 12 units pRBCs). Clinical picture on 
admission to OSH appeared consistent with alcoholic hepatitis, 
with a ___ DF score of 45. Corticosteroids were not given, 
and given time course of presentation, further steroids were 
avoided, especially in the setting of concern for infection. 
There was no appreciable ascites on exam or ultrasound with 
prior no history of SBP. She was continued on empiric 
antibiotics as above, was continued on Pantoprazole 40 mg BID. 
Patient was seen by social work for resources for alcohol 
counseling outpatient. 

#HYPONATREMIA: likely from hypovolemia in setting of blood loss 
and also poor oral intake, improved with tube feeds. There were 
no signs of renal function impairment, any hypervolemic state 
such as pulmonary edema or ascites.

# POOR PO Intake: complicated by nausea , suboptimal energy 
currently and need for nutrition given alcohol hepatitis. 
Patient was initiated and discharged on Jevity tube feeds with 
home ___ care.

# ACUTE BLOOD LOSS ANEMIA, ON ANEMIA OF CHRONIC DISEASE: Patient 
with chronic anemia, with initial bleeding from right foot 
hematoma for which she had required transfusion of 12 u pRBC at 
outside hospial. Her iron studies were consistent with liver 
disease/chronic disease. Pantoprazole was continued given 
history of guaic positive stools. Patient does have history of 
grade I varices (last EGD ___. Given stable blood pressures 
and no signs of acute infection, home nadolol was resumed.

#COAGULOPATHY: patient was given vitamin K for her coagulopathy, 
note did have nausea/abdominal pain to IV dosing, to be avoided 
in future care.
 
#THROMBOCYTOPENIA:  Secondary to hepatic cirrhosis, stable. 

CHRONIC ISSUES  
# SEIZURES: continued on home leviteracetam.  
# HYPOTHYROISIDM: continued on home levothyroxine.  
# PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY: likely related to EtOH abuse, continued 
on home gabapentin.  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ with history of alcohol abuse complicated by 
presumed cirrhosis, neuropathy, and withdrawal seizures who 
initially presented to an outside hospital after a fall, found 
to have common bile duct dilatation, now transferred for 
evaluation by the ERCP service. She is a limited historian, but 
recalls slipping in the context of descending a staircase with 
the assistance of her cane, falling without headstrike or loss 
of consciousness 3 days ago. She attributes the fall, which was 
unwitnessed, to unsteadiness in the context of chronic alcoholic 
neuropathy, for which she requires a cane at baseline, denying 
prodromal symptoms, including lightheadedness, chest pain, 
palpitations, or involuntary movements; there was no subsequent 
confusion per her recollection. She does note that in the days 
preceding her fall she had been experiencing loose stools, up to 
5 per day and tinged with ""flecks"" of bright red blood, in 
association with nausea and occasional small-volume nonbloody, 
nonbilious emesis. Others in her household experienced a similar 
gastrointestinal illness, and her symptoms reportedly had 
resolved by the time of her arrival to the outside hospital. She 
endorses generally poor appetite, intermittent epistaxis and 
easy bruising, chronic minimal nonproductive cough, and perhaps 
recently increased abdominal distention, but denies fevers, 
chills, sweats, meningismus, URI symptoms, chest pain, shortness 
of breath, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, or focal weakness. 
She believes that she has been thinking clearly. She last drank 
1 pint of vodka 5 days ago and denies withdrawal symptoms prior 
to admission to ___.  
She initially presented to ___ on ___, 
where she was found to be intoxicated with alcohol and treated 
supportively, including with a CIWA scale for impending 
withdrawal.  
CXR and cervical spine CT were unrevealing. After abdominal 
ultrasound and MRCP revealed common bile duct dilatation, 
presumably due to the presence of a stone, she was transferred 
to ___ for evaluation by the ERCP service. Of note, abdominal 
ultrasound was without significant ascites. Her stay was 
otherwise complicated by normocytic anemia nadiring at Hgb/Hct 
of ___, prompting administration of 2 units packed red blood 
cells on ___, with appropriate response to 10.4/30.4. She 
also received vancomycin and ceftazidime empirically for 
possible pneumonia in the setting of presumed atelectatic 
changes on CXR, and occasional abdominal pain was attributed to 
alcoholic pancreatitis (lipase of 511 at discharge) in the 
absence of fevers, hemodynamic instability, or other clinical 
signs of infection. Blood and urine cultures were not obtained.  

On arrival to the floor, she is sleepy, but easily arousable and 
denies discomfort of any kind, including abdominal pain.

Imaging:

___ MRCP

IMPRESSION:  
  
1.  Detection of tiny stones within the biliary tree might be 
limited by 
motion artifact as well as a trace of ascites fluid. 
Cholelithiasis, but no 
definite choledocholithiasis.  There is no significant biliary 
ductal dilation 
seen on this examination. 
  
2.  Hepatomegaly, and mild-moderately fatty liver. Heterogeneity 
of the liver 
enhancement is non-mass-like and nonspecific. 
  
3.  Hypoenhancing nodules are seen in the subcapsular portion of 
segment 8 of the liver.  While they are not particularly 
suspicious for hepatocellular carcinoma, recommend continued 
hepatic surveillance given the chronic liver disease. 
  
4.  There appears to be a filling defect within the left gastric 
artery, which supplies a replaced left hepatic artery. In 
addition, there appears to be marked stenosis at the origin of 
the right hepatic artery, which is replaced and arising from the 
SMA. 
  
5.  Changes of marked portal hypertension, with trace pleural 
effusions and trace ascites also noted. 

Abdominal ultrasound (___):  
1. Heterogenous liver consistent with cirrhosis. No focal liver 
lesion. Subcapsular structures in the right lobe on CT ___ 
not visible.  
2. Retrograde flow in main portal vein.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ with history of alcohol abuse complicated by 
presumed cirrhosis, neuropathy, and withdrawal seizures who 
initially presented to an outside hospital after a fall, found 
to have common bile duct dilatation, now transferred for 
evaluation by the ERCP service.  

# Alcoholic hepatitis: Transaminitis on presentation to ___ 
___ is consistent with an alcoholic pattern of 
liver injury, with discriminant function of 37.9 at that time, 
suggesting that she may benefit from glucocorticoid therapy once 
infection has been excluded. As DF in the ______ and not rapidly 
improving, patient started on prednisone on ___ with plan to 
complete a 28 day course. No ascites to tap, no evidence of 
infectious process.
 
# Common bile duct dilatation: She was found to have common bile 
duct distention to 7mm at the outside hospital on abdominal 
ultrasound and MRCP, presumed secondary to presence of a stone. 
Per ERCP recs, MRCP performed on ___: no biliary dilatation 
seen, therefore ultimately did not need ERCP. Treated for 
alcoholic hepatitis per above.   
 
# Fall: Fall preceding presentation to ___ 
seems likely mechanical in the setting of known alcoholic 
neuropathy without prodromal symptoms to suggest alternative 
etiology. Patient was actively intoxicated at admission. She 
does report chronically poor oral intake and a recent diarrheal 
illness, since resolved, raising the possibility of contributory 
orthostasis. Gave IVF, encouraged po intake.  
 
# Alcohol abuse: She discloses significant alcohol consumption, 
having been sober intermittently in the past following 
detoxification stays. Last drink was 5 days ago, with 
intermittent scoring on CIWA scale at ___. She 
did not score on CIWA at ___. Continued folate, thiamine, 
multivitamin. Social work saw the patient and the patient stated 
that she was already set up with AA and outpatient services. She 
did not want an inpatient or outpatient rehab stay.    

# Alcoholic cirrhosis: She has radiographic evidence of 
cirrhosis on ___ imaging, as well as varices 
of uncertain grade. She is presently sleepy, but without signs 
of hepatic encephalopathy, outside hospital ultrasound was 
without tappable ascites, and she has had no clear signs of 
bleeding. She declines prior decompensation by hepatic 
encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, or variceal 
bleed. She was set up with hepatology f/u at discharge as she 
does not have a primary hepatologist and has reported varices 
but is not on nadolol. 
 
# Normocytic anemia: Normocytic anemia nadiring at Hgb/Hct of 
___, prompting administration of 2 units packed red blood 
cells on ___, with appropriate response to 10.4/30.4. 
Anemia likely reflects alcohol toxicity and sequestration. B12 
and folate were reassuring at the outside hospital. There is low 
suspicion for hemolysis, given transfusion-responsiveness, and 
she has had no signs of active bleeding. Hct remained stable 
during hospital stay.
 
# Thrombocytopenia: Platelet count declined from 180 on 
admission to ___ to 88 by the time of 
transfer, likely reflecting IV hydration superimposed on chronic 
sequestration. There is low suspicion for DIC or HITT in the 
absence of documented heparin exposure. Platelet count remained 
stable.  
 
# Coagulopathy: INR has remained in the 2.4-2.5 range at ___ 
___, likely reflecting synthetic dysfunction 
coupled with poor nutrition. As above, there is low suspicion 
for consumptive coagulopathy. She was given po vitamin K to 
correct her INR. 
  
# Hypothyroidism: TSH was 9.89 at ___, perhaps 
reflecting sick euthyroidism, in which TSH may be elevated 
following an initial phase of suppression. Upon calling the 
patient's pharmacy, however, patient has not been filling her 
levothyroxine prescription. She was restarted on her home dose 
thyroxine. 

# History of withdrawal seizures: Continued home levetiracetam.
  
# Depression: Continued home fluoxetine, hydroxyzine, and 
quetiapine.
  
# Neuropathy: Presumed secondary to alcoholism. Continued home 
gabapentin.  

# Hypertension: Not currently on medications

# Incidentaloma: Right liver lesion noted incidentally on ___ 
___ imaging, with CT or MRI advised in follow-up, 
no duration specified. 
   
#CODE: Full (confirmed)  
#CONTACT: Mother and HCP ___: ___ 

Transitional issues:
-Patient will need labs every week: CBC, full chemistry panel, 
coags, LFT's
-She should have a TSH rechecked as an outpatient as she had 
stopped taking her levothyroxine prior to admission to the 
hospital. She should also have a f/u CT or MRI given an 
incidental R liver lesion noted at ___ no 
duration specified per radiology.
-Patient will continue a 28-total day course of prednisone for 
alcoholic hepatitis.
-Per social work, patient is already set up with AA and sobriety 
programs as an outpatient
-Patient will need to establish care with hepatology and has 
been scheduled an appointment with the ___ on ___.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o woman with a history of alcoholic 
cirrhosis who presented to OSH with chest and flank pain after a 
fall, found to have severe anemia, possible cholangitis, and 
positive blood culture. MRCP at ___ was negative for 
cholangitis. Positive blood culture thought to be contaminant. 
The patient was transfused 2 units pRBCs for her anemia. The 
patient then developed an oxygen requirement to 6L and was found 
to have bibasilar infiltrates concerning for HCAP. She completed 
an 8-day course of vancomycin/cefepime with improvement in her 
oxygen requirement; she was discharged on room air. For her 
alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis, she was initiated on steroids 
once her pneumonia was well-controlled. A Dobhoff was placed for 
nutritional support with tube feeds. The patient was started on 
PCP prophylaxis with dapsone. She underwent EGD with 3 cords of 
grade I varices and was initiated on nadolol.

===================
ACTIVE ISSUES:
===================

# Alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis: The patient has a history 
of alcoholic cirrhosis. She had been sober for 7 months, but two 
weeks prior to admission she began drinking again. No history of 
complications including hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, or 
variceal bleeding. She presented with a DF of 32 on admission, 
and was given prednisolone 40 mg x1. Prednisone was not 
initially continued due to pending infectious evaluation. 
Patient was subsequently diagnosed with HCAP (see below) and 
treated with 8 days of vancomycin/cefepime. Once her infection 
was well-controlled she was started on prednisone 40 mg on ___ 
for 28 days (taper TBD). She was noted to have improvement in 
Tbili and INR s/p steroid initiation. ___ was placed ___ 
and advanced via ___ ___ for Jevity tube feeds. She was started 
on dapsone for PCP ___ (neg for G6PD deficiency; Bactrim 
allergy). She also underwent EGD that showed 3 cords of grade I 
varices so she was initiated on nadolol. She was continued on 
folate, thiamine, and a multivitamin.

# ___: Patient presented with ___ (creatinine increased to 2.0) 
in setting of acute illness, likely initially pre-renal and 
subsequently secondary to possible overdiuresis in setting of 
hypoxia (below). Given albumin 1 mg/kg x 2 days without 
significant improvement. Subsequently diuresed due to concern 
for volume overload. Creatinine improved after diuretics were 
discontinued. Creatinine back to 1.0 at discharge (baseline).

# HCAP: Patient with worsening hypoxia to 6L and found to have 
bibasilar infiltrates on CXR. Initially thought to be component 
of volume overload secondary to albumin challenge for ___ as 
above, so patient diuresed with Lasix IV 20 mg. She completed 
8-days of vancomycin/cefepime with improvement in her 
respiratory status. Discharged on RA.

# Hyponatremia: Admitted with hyponatremia to 124 in setting of 
decompensation and infection. Resolved to 134 on discharge.

# CoNS bacteremia: Noted on 1 set of blood cultures at ___ 
___ to grow CoNS, believed to be contaminant. However, 
patient arrived to ___ febrile and tachycardic and therefore 
started on vancomycin. Patient was continued on vancomycin for 
HCAP treatment as above.

# Anemia: Patient presented from OSH with Hgb 6.2 and had 
appropriate increase in hemoglobin after 2 units pRBCs. There 
was no evidence of a GIB but she did report menorrhagia, which 
resolved.

# Thrombocytopenia: Patient with stable thrombocytopenia likely 
secondary to chronic sequestration.

# Coagulopathy: INR 2.0-2.5 likely reflecting synthetic 
dysfunction. Patient given IV and PO vitamin K without 
improvement in INR.

# Multiple hematomas s/p fall: Patient reports that she fell 
down a set of stairs in her home while working on a home 
___. Exam revealed multiple large hematomas. CT 
Abd/Pelvis w/o contrast at OSH on ___ without evidence of 
intrabdominal hematoma. Patient denied intimate partner 
violence. Hematomas improved over course of hospitalizations.

# Lice: Treated with lindane and permethrin.

===================
CHRONIC ISSUES:
===================
# Chronic leg pain: Continued gabapentin. 

# History of withdrawal seizures: Continued home levetiracetam.

# Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine.

=======================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
=======================
# Patient started on prednisone 40 mg daily for alcoholic 
hepatitis. She will be discharged on 28-day total course of 
prednisone (last day ___ with taper determined by hepatology 
follow-up.
# Patient started on dapsone for PCP ppx given sulfa allergy. 
G6PD test negative.
# Patient noted to have 3 cords of grade I varices, so was 
started on nadolol.
# Weight on discharge: 79.3 kg

The patient is a ___ y/o F with a PMHx significant for Hep C c/b 
hepatocellular carcinoma (Childs A), hyperthyroidism who was 
recently admitted here for what is thought to be infectious 
colitis now presenting with ___.  

ACTIVE ISSUES
==============
# ___
Patient was recently admitted with infectious colitis and had 
normal renal function at that time.  She returned with ___ (Cr 
3.5) which was ultimately thought to be pre-renal in nature 
given her history of vomiting/poor PO intake and downtrending Cr 
with IVF.  On the day of discharge, her cr had downtrended to 
1.5.  Given that she has a history of hepatitic C, cryoglobulins 
were checked and were pending at the time of discharge, and 
subsequently returned negative. RF, checked as a marker for 
cryoglobulinemia, was WNL. Given significant improvement of Cr 
with hydration as well as resolution of nausea, vomiting, and 
diarrhea, pt was discharged with plans for Cr recheck within 5 
days of discharge. Hospital course and transitional issues 
including Cr f/u were discussed directly with covering PCP by 
telephone on the day of discharge.

# Nausea
Patient was admitted with complaint of two days of nausea with 
one episode of non-blood emesis.  Patient was given IV zofran 
and nausea/vomiting resolved over the course of her stay.  Given 
patient's report of leg weakness, her acute episode of 
hypertension, her past history of seizures and hyponatremia, as 
well as her intermittent nausea/vomiting/abdominal pain, if 
patient experiences another acute episode, testing for acute 
intermittent porphyria could be considered in outpatient 
setting.

# Black stools
Patient reported having ""black stools"" over the 24-hours prior 
to admission.  Hct upon admission was stable and HR was not 
elevated to suggest acute blood loss. She denied taking any iron 
or supplements which would turn her stool black. On discharge, 
patient reported that her stools were more formed compared to 
prior to admission, and were of normal brown color.  

# Elevated blood pressures
During prior admission, patient had elevated BPs to the 
systolics of 170s, she was asymptomatic at the time.  She was 
started on amlodipine 5mg PO daily but this was discontinued at 
her PCP appointment two days prior to admission given 
normotensive readings.  Upon admission patient's blood pressure 
was elevated to SBP 185 and she was reinitiated on amlodipine.  
On the day of discharge, patient was once again normotensive and 
amlodipine was discontinued. Markedly elevated BPs were likely 
associated with ___. She will followup with her PCP as an 
outpatient for further blood pressure monitoring.

CHRONIC ISSUES
================
#  Hyperthyroidism: Continued home dose propylthiouracil 
#  Hepatitis C c/b hepatocellular carcinoma: Thrombocytopenia 
and transaminitis at baseline.

BRIEF HOSPITAL SUMMARY
=====================
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with history of HCV s/p Harvoni c/b 
Childs A cirrhosis, history of prior hepatic lesion that 
spontaneously regressed on serial imaging, hyperthyroidism, and 
osteopenia who was transferred from ___ for continuity of care 
and biopsy. She initially presented to ___ with abdominal 
pain, nausea, and vomiting, where imaging showed a ~5cm liver 
lesion. She was then transferred to ___ where she had 
unsuccessful biopsy attempt, and therefore transferred to ___ for 
further workup and to see her regular providers. On arrival her 
symptoms had resolved. Radiology reread her images and 
recommended EUS-guided biopsy, lymphoma protocol (results 
pending). She had persistent hypertension after the biopsy that 
improved with medications. She also had tachycardia with 
exertion that improved with bolus of IVF. She was discharged 
with close follow up. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=================
[ ] We recommend the PCP follow up on the biopsy results. The 
oncology team here will also call the patient to schedule follow 
up when the biopsy results. 
[ ] Follow up on plasma metanephrine level and consider 24-hour 
urine metanephrine for further workup of possible 
pheochromocytoma if her symptoms persists
[ ] Will need EGD as follow up for cirrhosis management of 
variceal monitoring
[ ] If ___ has persistently poor appetite, consider starting 
mirtazapine QHS for appetite stimulation
[ ] Please titrate blood pressure medications as needed. 

# CONTACT: ___, Daughter, ___

MEDICATION CHANGES
==================
Increased lisinopril from 5mg daily to 20mg daily 
Started amlodipine 7.5mg daily for hypertension
Started marinol 2.5mg BID for appetite stimulation
Prescribing Zofran ODT for PRN use 

ACUTE ISSUES
===========
# Liver lesion with extension into portal vein 
At ___, CT torso showed heterogenous liver mass with invasion 
into the portal vein. An MRI showed a heterogenously enhancing 
mass predominantly intravascular in the main portal vein. ___ was 
unable to do the biopsy due to the location. GI was unable to 
collect tissue via EUS. Their plan was to consult surgical 
oncology for biopsy but after discussion with Dr. ___ was 
transferred to ___ for continuity of care. On arrival she 
reported her pain, nausea, and vomiting had resolved. CDs were 
obtained from ___ and ___ radiologists reread the films and 
recommended EUS. The ERCP fellow did a biopsy (results pending). 
___ had nausea and vomiting after the procedure that resolved 
with Zofran. 

# Hypertension
Well controlled on presentation. She reports she was recently 
diagnosed with hypertension but upon review of her atria's 
records it appears that she has been hypertensive in the clinic 
for several years and has declined antihypertensive medications. 
SBP 200s after procedure likely secondary to nausea, vomiting, 
and pain. However, hypertension persisted despite uptitration of 
medications. Workup for pheochromocytoma was initiated with 
plasma metanephrines because patient reported recent episodes of 
sweating. She was discharged on higher dose of lisinopril and 
amlodipine. 

# Tachycardia
#Orthostasis
Intermittent tachycardia after the biopsy worse with activity, 
not sustaining. Likely volume depleted in the setting of poor PO 
intake. We bolused her with fluids which improved her 
orthostasis.

# Nausea/Vomiting
Nausea and vomiting after biopsy likely secondary to MAC during 
the procedure. Resolved with zofran. 

# Anorexia
Patient reported poor appetite for several weeks, perhaps 
secondary to malignancy. We started marinol and nutrition was 
consulted who felt she met criteria for severe malnutrition. 

CHRONIC ISSUES

=========

RUQUS ___
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. Large, soft tissue lesion centered around the porta hepatis, 
with extension 
into the main portal vein, which does not demonstrate definite 
flow.  This is 
better assessed on the prior CT. 
2. Enlarged node adjacent to the pancreatic head, as seen on 
prior CT, 
measuring up to 3.5 cm. 
3. Moderate sludge within the gallbladder, without evidence of 
stones. 

MRCP ___

1. Redemonstration of a large mass centered with the porta 
hepatis which 
infiltrates and expands the main portal vein and the 
intrahepatic portal 
veins, not significantly changed compared with CT ___, 
but enlarged 
since  ___. 
2. No significant change in degree of mild to moderate 
intrahepatic biliary 
duct dilatation due to mass effect at the porta hepatis. 
3. Intrahepatic peribiliary enhancement, compatible with 
cholangitis.  No 
abscess. 
4. No evidence of cholecystitis. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with carcinoma of unknown 
primary, hepatobiliary in origin, HCV s/p Harvoni c/b Childs A 
cirrhosis, hyperthyroidism who presented with fever and RUQ pain 
c/f ascending cholangitis vs cholecystitis.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[] Patient on 7 day course of cefpedox/flagyl. Last day ___.
[] Discharge Hgb 9.9 on the day of discharge. Will follow-up on 
___ will cbc re-check.

ACUTE ISSUES
============
# Fever
# Leukocytosis
# Suspected cholangitis vs cholecystitis
She presented with fever, fatigue and abdominal pain. This was 
concerning for an infectious etiology, possibly cholangitis 
given her hx of ?hepatic carcinoma or cholecystitis. Fever could 
also be seen with cancer-associated thrombosis though there were 
no clear localizing signs to suggest this diagnosis. She had a 
leukocytosis to 12 which normalized by the time of discharge. 
She had a rising total bilirubin, which was thought to be iso 
intrahepatic biliary obstruction causing a possible infection. 
She was started on empiric ceftriaxone/flagyl. A RUQ US (___) 
showed a large soft-tissue ___ hepatis lesion extending 
into portal vein consistent with known malignancy. There were no 
signs of infection. An MRCP was then performed on ___ and showed 
intrahepatic peribiliary enhancement which was ""compatible with 
cholangitis"". By HD3 she was feeling better with no abdominal 
pain and she remained afebrile. She was transitioned to PO 
cefpedoxime/flagyl and discharged to finish a ___arcinoma of unknown primary
She had previously received FOLFOX C4D15 on ___. Due to 
persistent cytopenias and disease progression, the plan was to 
switch to new treatment at some point, possible lenvatinib. MRCP 
on ___ showed unchanged hepatic lesion with infiltration into 
the portal vein from prior CT on ___. She will have 
follow-up on ___ in ___ clinic. She was going to see 
Radiation Oncology on ___ but was unable to attend that 
appointment as she was hospitalized. She was seen by RadOnc 
during this hospitalization and will see them as an outpatient 
after discharge.

# Anemia
Pt was noted to have a down-trending hemoglobin to 9.9 (down 
from ___ on admission). Potentially there is an element of 
hemodilution however we have instructed the patient to have her 
labs checked on ___. Iron and B12 studies pending at the time of 
discharge. 

# Pain
She continued on her home oxycodone 5mg q4h PRN. Her abdominal 
pain improved during this admission.

# HTN
Her SBP was in the high 180s-190s upon admission in the setting 
of not being on her home anti-hypertensive and she remained 
asymptomatic. This was presumably in the setting of infection 
and pain. She continued on her lisinopril and amlodipine and her 
SBPs improved to 140s upon discharge.

# Osteoporosis
She continued on her weekly alendronate.

# Code status: Full presumed
# HCP: ___ (daughter) / p ___

This patient was prescribed, or continued on, an opioid pain 
medication at the time of discharge (please see the attached 
medication list for details). As part of our safe opioid 
prescribing process, all patients are provided with an opioid 
risks and treatment resource education sheet and encouraged to

2.5, and was trended during hospital course. It decreased on a 
daily basis.  Transplant service was consulted, and they were 
not keen on doing a CCY until patient's MELD score was low 
enough. MRCP showed no choledocholithiasis, but Cholelithiasis.  
In the future, she will likely need a cholecystectomy.

IMAGING
===================
CXR ___: Comparison to ___.  In the interval, 
the patient has received a tracheostomy tube. The nasogastric 
tube was removed.  The right internal jugular vein catheter is 
stable. No complications, notably no pneumothorax.  Otherwise 
unchanged appearance of the heart and the lung parenchyma. 
===
UNILAT UP EXT VEINS ___: PICC line is seen within the 
right basilic vein, which demonstrates nonocclusive thrombus. 
===
___ EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU 
monitoring study because of (1) occasional-frequent 
bifrontally-predominant sharp waves with a triphasic morphology, 
more prominent during arousals when they can occur in brief runs 
at up to 1 Hz, without evolution. This is consistent with 
generalized cortical Irritability that may be toxic-metabolic in 
etiology. (2) Mild generalized background slowing c/w a mild 
encephalopathy which is nonspecific in etiology and for which 
the most common causes are medication effect, toxic-metabolic 
Disturbance or infection. Note is made of an irregular 
tachycardia throughout much of the study. No pushbutton events 
or electrographic seizures are captured. Compared to the prior 
day's recording, there are no significant changes. 
===
___: CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST 
1. No acute intracranial abnormality. 
2. No evidence acute intracranial hemorrhage. 
3. Paranasal sinus disease as described. 
==== 
___ EEG
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study 
because of 
(1) rare independent left and right temporal sharp waves, 
consistent with 
focal cortical irritability in these regions; (2) slowing and 
disorganization of the background indicative of a mild 
encephalopathy which is nonspecific in etiology and for which 
the most common causes are medication effect, toxic-metabolic 
disturbance or infection. Note is made of an irregular 
tachycardia throughout much of the study. No pushbutton events 
or electrographic seizures are captured. 
===
___ US NECK, SOFT TISSUE
Limited exam demonstrating increased echogenicity of the 
subcutaneous fat, 
compatible with inflammatory change and/or site of IV 
infiltration/hematoma, without evidence of a discrete fluid 
collection. 
===
ECHO ___
Sinus tachycardia. The left ventricular cavity is small. Left 
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>80%). Right 
ventricular chamber size is normal/small with 
normal/hyperdynamic free wall contractility. There is no aortic 
valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular 
inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. 
===

valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular 
inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. 
===
___  MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST
1. No acute intracranial abnormality including hemorrhage, 
infarct or 
enhancing mass. 
2. No definite epileptogenic focus. 
3. Moderate global atrophy and white matter signal abnormality 
suggestive of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. 
4. Paranasal sinus disease as described. 
===
___ ORBITAL X-RAY   No radio-opaque foreign body is detected 
over the orbits. 
===
___ B/L VENOUS ULTRASOUND No evidence of deep venous thrombosis 
in the right or left lower extremity veins. 
===
___ ECHO The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal 
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are 
normal (LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are 
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but 
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a 
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no 
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.   
===
___ EEG - This continuous video-EEG monitoring study captured no 
pushbutton activations or electrographic seizures. There were 
occasional multifocal sharp waves, signifying the possibility of 
cortical hyperexcitability and an epileptogenic process. The 
background, which included very frequent and at times 
quasi-periodic triphasic-appearing slow waves, suggested a 
moderate diffuse encephalopathy, which implies widespread 
cerebral dysfunction but is nonspecific as to etiology. Note is 
made of a rapid and irregularly irregular cardiac rhythm. 
===
REPEATED CHEST X-RAYS FOR TUBE PLACEMENT NOTED good tube 
placement and Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
===
___ EEG: This continuous video-EEG monitoring study captured no 
pushbutton 
activations, electrographic seizures, or epileptiform 
discharges. The 
background suggested a mild-moderate diffuse encephalopathy, 
which implies 
widespread cerebral dysfunction but is nonspecific as to 
etiology. Note is 
made of a rapid and irregularly irregular cardiac rhythm. 
===
___ EKG Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. 
Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities. No previous tracing available 
for comparison.  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o woman with baseline dementia, DM2, and recent seizure 
activity (in context of hypoglycemia) transferred from 
___ with urosepsis and altered mental status. The 
patient was intubated in setting of altered mental status and 
failed extubation due to airway edema. Her hospital course was 
complicated by septic shock and respiratory failure now s/p 
trach/PEG, and new atrial fibrillation.

==================
ACTIVE ISSUES
==================

# Septic shock: On admission, the patient was found to be in 
septic shock, likely secondary to urinary source, with urine 
culture positive for E. coli from outside hospital. She was 
initially on ceftriaxone but was broadened to vancomycin/zosyn 
at OSH. Given that E. coli was sensitive was ceftriaxone, she 
was narrowed to this. However, she began to have persistent 
fevers so was broadened to vancomycin/cefepime. Given her 
altered mental status, cefepime was changed to ceftazidime due 
to concern for cefepime neurotoxicity. She completed a course of 
antibiotics for her urinary tract infection, but again became 
febrile on ___ and was started on vanc/zosyn given unclear 
etiology of fevers. Suspicion was for tracheitis in the setting 
of intubation. Her planned course of vanc/zosyn is 5 days (Last 
day: ___. At time of discharge, patient was afebrile with 
resolving leukocytosis (WBC 9.2) and minimal nonpurulent 
secretions. 

# Altered Mental Status: Patient with dementia at baseline. She 
had seizure-like events ___ years prior to admission. The patient 
had a seizure at the outside hospital while getting a CT scan. 
EEG done during admission showed mild-moderate diffuse 
encephalopathy, which implies widespread cerebral dysfunction 
but is nonspecific as to etiology. The patient had multiple 
repeat EEGs (___) that had 
similar findings. The patient was discharged on Keppra 500 mg 
BID and she should follow up with neurology.

# Respiratory failure: Patient with seizure at OSH while getting 
CT and was intubated for airway protection. She required 
intubation from ___ - ___. She then failed extuation due to 
airway edema on ___ and was reintubated. Patient had a trach 
placed on ___.

# Atrial fibrillation: New onset likely in the setting of septic 
shock. During this admission, patient has had heart rates 
ranging from 100 - 180. During this admission, she was trialed 
on various regimens with metoprolol, amiodarone, diltiazem, and 
digoxin. At time of discharge, patient was stable on metoprolol 
50 mg Q6H and digoxin 125mcg. Amiodarone was discontinued 
because it had little effect on her heart rates, and diltiazem 
was discontinued due to low blood pressures. She was started on 
anticoagulation with heparin gtt with bridge to warfarin, goal 
INR ___.

# Non-occlusive venous thrombosis (RUE): Patient was found to 
have a right upper extremity non-occlusive thrombus in setting 
of PICC line in place for IV antibiotics, last day ___. PICC 
should be discontinued as soon as possible. Patient on 
anticoagulation as above.

# PEG tube: Given altered mental status, a PEG tube was placed 
at the time of tracheostomy. The patient was initiated on tube 
feeds and was tolerating them well at time of discharge.

# DMII: Patient initially with uncontrolled glucose >400. 
Negative ketones on ___ was consulted and recommend 
adjustments to her insulin regimen. The patient was started on 
tube feeds as above. Patient was discharged on Lantus 40 units 
QAM and 12 unit regular insulin Q6H.

pressure. You also needed a breathing tube and machine to help 
with your breathing, however, because your airway swelled you 
had to be transitioned to a tracheotomy, a surgical procedure 
that involved making an incision in your neck and connecting a 
tube to allow you to breathe. You also were given a feeding 
tube. You were started on medicines to control your heart rate, 
antibiotics to control your infection, and insulin for your 
diabetes.

Please continue the medications at rehabilitation and follow-up 
with your cardiologist and neurologist. 

We wish you the best of health.

Sincerely,
Your ___ Team

IMAGING
=======

+ CXR (___)
Left IJ approach central venous catheter tip projects over the 
mid SVC.  There
is no pneumothorax.  The lungs are clear.  There is no 
consolidation or
effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. 
 Dense
atherosclerotic calcifications noted in the thoracic aorta.  
Rounded opacity
projecting over left upper quadrant may represent a PEG tube.  
Surgical clips
in the right upper quadrant.

+ PELVIS AP (___)
No acute fracture.

+ RENAL US (___)
Normal renal ultrasound.  No evidence of hydronephrosis.

+ ECHO (___)
CONCLUSIONS
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure 
is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size 
are normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic 
(EF>75%). There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract 
obstruction (22 mmHg at HR 96). Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. There is abnormal septal 
motion/position. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened 
(?#). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets 
are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. 
There is severe mitral annular calcification. The study is 
inadequate to exclude significant mitral valve stenosis though 
demonstrates flow acceleration across the mitral valve 
consistent with at least mild functional stenosis. Trivial 
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the 
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly 
UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial 
effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, 
and hyperdynamic regional/global systolic function. Mild left 
ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Aortic regurgitation and 
mitral stenosis likely present (not well quantified on current 
study). Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
there is now a mild left ventricular outflow tract gradient 
during systole. 

+ CXR (___)
Compared to chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
Lung volumes are substantially lower.  New peribronchial 
opacification in the
left lower lobe is more likely atelectasis than pneumonia.  The 
upper lungs
are clear.  No pleural abnormality.  Heart size normal.  Left 
jugular line
ends in the mid SVC, as before.

+ G-TUBE CHECK (___)
A percutaneous gastrostomy tube is present and is adequately 
positioned with
no evidence of extravasated contrast material.

+ EEG (___)
This is an abnormal continuous EEG monitoring study because of
(1) posterior quadrant discharges (L>R), indicative of focal 
areas of cortical
irritability with increased propensity to develop electrographic 
seizures. (2)
Diffuse background slowing with periods of generalized 
suppressions are
consistent with a moderate to severe encephalopathy. This is a 
nonspecific
finding in regards to etiology but can be seen in the setting of
toxic/metabolic derangements, infection or medications. There 
are no
electrographic seizures. Compared to the previous day's 
recording, there is a
significant improvement in the background with much less 
frequent epileptiform
discharges/triphasic appearing waveforms.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF SUMMARY STATEMENT:
=============================
___ w/ Afib, seizure disorder, systolic CHF, and dementia, who 
presented with altered mental status, had a cardiac arrest in 
the ED, and was admitted to the ICU for post-arrest management. 
Course was complicated by UTI and acute renal failure, and she 
improved with fluids and antibiotics. Code status changed to 
DNR/DNI. 

ACTIVE ISSUES:
=============================
# CARDIAC ARREST: Patient had transient episode of asystole in 
the ED after getting calcium gluconate/insulin/dextrose for 
hyperkalemia. ROSC achieved after brief (around 10 seconds) of 
chest compressions. Unclear precipitant but concerning 
elevations in aVR and depressions in lateral leads on EKG. 
Cardiac enzymes reassuringly negative. Long pause vs asystole 
potentially from calcium gluconate infusion in the setting of 
elevated dig level. Patient w/ known CAD and documented stents 
in RCA territory. EKG changes potentially demand in the setting 
of being hyperdynamic due to hypovolemia and infected. She was 
closely monitored on telemetry, and remained hemodynamically 
stable throughout rest of hospitalization. 

# URINARY TRACT INFECTION: Patient presented w/o documented 
fevers but with leukocytosis w/ neutrophilic predominance and UA 
suggestive of infection. CXR w/o acute process. LFTs wnl. No 
imaging evidence of pyelonephritis. Chronic ulcers to coccyx and 
___ as potential sources of infection.  New G-tube oozing at 
site, cultured- growing ___ albicans. IP adjusted 
bumper. Afebrile. She was thought to have a UTI, and was started 
initially on Vanc/Zosyn, and Vanc was stopped on ___.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. LEGAL & SAFETY:  
On admission, the patient signed a conditional voluntary 
agreement (Section 10 & 11) and remained on that level 
throughout her admission. She was also placed on 15 minute 
checks, our lowest checks status, and remained on that level of 
observation throughout her stay, while being unit-restricted.  

2. PSYCHIATRIC:
#) Major depressive disorder: 
On arrival to the unit, patient was tearful and endorsed 
""depressed"" mood with labile affect. She did state that she was 
having suicidal thoughts about the ""world being better off 
without me"" before getting into the ___ water, and that then 
the tide swept her away. Stated that she was very happy to have 
survived, but that she was struggling with guilt surrounding 
hurting her husband and child. Also expressed remorse 
surrounding the idea of losing custody of her child. She was 
accepting of care, and able to contract for safety while on the 
unit. Denied any acute suicidal ideation, intent, or plan. 
Stated that in the past the medication that had worked the best 
for her was Prozac. She was maintained on trazodone 50mg PO QHS 
for sleep.
During her stay, her home Paxil was downtitrated and Prozac was 
started and uptitrated. She was increased to Prozac 20mg PO QD. 
Additionally, she was started on Depakote for possible 
hypomania. She was increased to Depakote 500 mg QHS. She 
reported improvement in mood, as well as increased ability to 
cope with her circumstances. Patient and her family were very 
pleased and relieved to have a diagnosis of bipolar II disorder 
as they strongly believe her past problematic behavior is 
accurately explained by this condition. At the time of 
discharge, ___ was attending groups, was interactive in 
the milieu, and was able to participate in individual therapy. 

On discharge, patient reports ""better"" mood, has euthymic 
affect, and denies any suicidal thought, intent, or plan. She is 
future-oriented, with plan to attend intensive outpatient 
program and live at her parents' house before trying to go back 
to work. She will be discharged to home on Prozac 20 mg PO QD, 
trazodone 50mg PO QHs and Depakote 500 mg QHS.

3. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS:
#)Alcohol use disorder:

4. MEDICAL
#) Anion gap acidosis: Patient arrived to the ___ with an 
anion gap acidosis on serum testing, likely in setting of recent 
alcohol use. This resolved with conservative management in the 
ED. 

#) Hypothyroidism: Patient with TSH of 6.1 on admission to the 
inpatient unit. Her home Synthroid was increased to 50mcg PO QD. 
It is possible that hypothyroidism could have contributed in 
part to her mood episode.

5. PSYCHOSOCIAL
#) GROUPS/MILIEU:  
The patient was encouraged to participate in the various groups 
and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit.  The 
patients primary team met with her daily and various 
psychotherapeutic modalities were utilized during those times. 
She was increasingly able to engage in groups and therapy during 
her stay, as her mood and emotional lability improved. 

#) COLLATERAL CONTACTS & FAMILY INVOLVEMENT
A family meeting was held with the patient's mother, ___ 
___. The patient reported not wanting to be a part of 
this meeting, as she felt that it would agitate her further. 

#) INTERVENTIONS
- Medications: Prozac
- Psychotherapeutic Interventions: Individual, group, and milieu 
therapy.
- Coordination of aftercare: Intensive outpatient program

INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, 
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of 
starting this medication, and risks and benefits of possible 
alternatives, including not taking the medication, with this 
patient.   We discussed the patient's right to decide whether to 
take this medication as well as the importance of the patient's 
actively participating in the treatment and discussing any  
questions about medications with the treatment team, and I  
answered the patient's questions.  The patient appeared able to 
understand and consented to begin the medication.

RISK ASSESSMENT
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to herself and/or others based upon 
attempted suicide attempt by drowning in the ___. 
Their static factors noted at that time include history of 
suicide attempts, chronic mental illness, history of substance 
abuse, Caucasian race, age, marital status.  She also had 
several modifiable risk factors addressed at that time, 
including disorganized and unpredictable behavior, hopelessness, 
agitation, recklessness, social withdrawal, limited coping 
skills, no established outpatient treatment, and active 
substance abuse. We addressed these risk factors by restarting 
her on Prozac, holding a family meeting, and connecting her with 
outpatient treaters and an intensive outpatient program. 
Finally, the patient is being discharged with many protective 
risk factors, including help-seeking nature, future-oriented 
viewpoint, sense of responsibility to family, lack of suicidal 
ideation, and family support. Overall, based on the totality of 
our assessment at this time, the patient is not at an acutely 
elevated risk of self-harm nor danger to others. Our prognosis 
of this patient is fair, given the above.

headache. She was also nauseated, vomited and had photophobia.
She waited for 3 days but her symptoms did not improve so she
went to see her PCP. She states that she was sent home and so 
she
decided to take Motrin 800mg around the clock. Her symptoms did 
not improve
therefore she went back to see her physician ___ ___. She
was given a prescription for an analgesic per her report and was
driving to the pharmacy when she had a surge of pain followed by
LOC. Her next memory is being found by EMS who took her to an
OSH. There she was found to have a SAH and transferred here for
further evaluation.

In the ED here, she was initially able to see from both eyes but
then noted loss of vision in her R eye as well as ""blurry"" 
vision
in her L eye. When these symptoms presented she was emergently
taken to CT and CTA which showed a aneurysm of the anterior
circulation with bleeding.

Pertinent Results:
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  ___ 9:06 AM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: Assess size of ventricles 

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
___ year old woman with ___ evd clamped 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Assess size of ventricles 
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HEAD CT

HISTORY: ___ woman with subarachnoid hemorrhage with 
ventricular drain clamped, assess for change in size of 
ventricles.

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images of the head were obtained 
from the skull base to the vertex.

FINDINGS: Comparison is made to ___.

Again seen is a ventricular shunt via left frontal approach with 
tip of the catheter within the region of the right foramen of 
___. The ventricles are re-expanded bilaterally, and there has 
also been decrease in size of the right extra-axial fluid 
collection as well as improved edema of the right frontal and 
basal ganglial infarcts. Therefore, the increase in size of the 
ventricles likely is due to decreased mass effect with 
improvement in the subfalcine herniation as opposed to clamping 
of the ventricular shunt.

Again seen is a small hypodensity along the ventricular shunt 
tract involving the left frontal lobe as before.

The basal cisterns, especially the quadrigeminal plate and 
ambient cisterns are better visualized suggestive of improved 
edema.

Tiny amounts of pneumocephalus are again seen.

Coil pack is again seen within the anterior communicating artery 
aneurysm.

Post-surgical changes of the right scalp are again noted.

IMPRESSION: Since ___, decrease in size of right extra-axial 
collection and decreased edema of the right basal 
ganglia/frontal lobe infarct, with improvement in the subfalcine 
herniation and improvement in mass effect of the lateral 
ventricles.

The basal cisterns are better visualized suggestive of improved 
cerebral edema.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  ___ 8:48 AM

INDICATION: ___ female with possible inadvertent 
withdrawal of central venous line.

COMPARISON: ___.

SINGLE PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The right subclavian 
catheter has been pulled back and now resides projecting over 
the right subclavian vein. There is no pneumothorax. The 
cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable and unremarkable and the 
lungs are clear.

CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS  ___ 9:45 AM

CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS; CT BRAIN PERFUSION

Reason: ** CTA/CTP** as per Dr. ___ 
Contrast: OPTIRAY

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
___ year old woman with acom SAH, s/p clipping 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
** CTA/CTP** as per Dr. ___ 
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: ___ status post ACom clipping.

COMPARISON: CT perfusion ___.

TECHNIQUE: Continuous axial images of the brain were obtained 
before and following administration of 100 cc IV Optiray 
contrast. Multiplanar MIP and volume-rendered CTA reformats were 
displayed. Mean transit time blood flow and blood volume were 
assessed by dynamic imaging.

FINDINGS:

NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: ACom aneurysm clip with associated 
metallic artifact is noted. Again seen is a hypoattenuating area 
within the right temporal and inferior frontal lobe consistent 
with evolving infarct. There is also expanding and increasingly 
conspicuous hypoattenuation within the right basal caudate, 
putamen, and internal capsule consistent with new/progressive 
infarction of this region. High-density right extra-axial fluid 
collection with small locules of air is unchanged measuring 13 
mm in greatest diameter. There is slightly increased mass effect 
on the subjacent sulci and increasing transtentorial and 
subfalcine herniation with leftward midline shift of 8 mm, 
previously 7 mm. Left ventriculostomy catheter terminates within 
the left lateral ventricle at the midline and the ventricles are 
stable in size. There is worsening effacement of the suprasellar 
and ambient cisterns consistent with increasing mass effect. The 
13-mm subgaleal fluid collection overlying the right frontal 
craniotomy is stable.

CTA OF THE HEAD: The cervical portions of the carotid arteries, 
vertebral arteries, and basilar artery are patent. There is 
improved opacification in the circle of ___ and its major 
branches. Specifically, there is marked improvement of vasospasm 
involving the distal right M1 and right M2 segments of the MCA. 
There is improvement in vasospasm of the A1 segments bilaterally 
(right greater than left) though the right A1 segment still 
shows moderate vasospasm. The A2 segments bilaterally also 
demonstrate markedly improved caliber. The left MCA and its 
branches are unremarkable. The bilateral PCA arteries are also 
unremarkable.

CT PERFUSION: There is patchy perfusion abnormality with 
decreased blood volume in the bilateral temporal lobes and also 
right frontal lobe, which likely relate to vasospasm.

IMPRESSION:

1. New/progressive infarction within the right basal ganglia.

2. Increasing mass effect and transtentorial herniation with 
worsening effacement of the suprasellar and ambient cisterns.

3. Improving vasospasm within the right MCA, and bilateral A1 
and A2 segments of the ACA. There is, however, persistent 
moderate vasospasm within the A1 segments, in close proximty to 
the ACOM aneurysm clip.

Findings were discussed with the neurosurgical team at 5:00 p.m.

TYPE OF STUDY: Left common carotid arteriogram, left internal 
carotid arteriogram, left vertebral arteriogram, right common 
carotid arteriogram, and right internal carotid arteriogram.

STAFF: Dr. ___.

FELLOW: Dr. ___.

Dr. ___ attending interventional neuroradiologist, was 
present and supervised throughout the procedure.

INDICATION: ___ female status post surgical clipping of 
an anterior communicating artery aneurysm, now post-operative 
day number seven. Rule out vasospasm.

COMPARISON: ___.

TECHNIQUE: Written informed consent was obtained from the 
patient's daughter after discussing the indications for the 
procedure, the risks of the procedure, and the alternative 
management. The discussed risks include stroke, loss of vision 
and/or speech which may be temporary or permanent, with possible 
treatment with stents and/or coils if needed. Additionally the 
indications, risks, and alternative management for possible 
intervention was explained.

The patient was brought to the interventional neuroradiology 
suite and placed on the biplane table in the supine position. 
Both groins were prepped and draped in the usual sterile 
fashion. A pre-procedure timeout was performed using two patient 
identifiers and verifying the procedure to be performed.

Access to the right common femoral artery was obtained using a 
19-gauge single-wall needle with 1% lidocaine mixed with sodium 
bicarbonate for local anesthetic. A 0.35 ___ wire was 
introduced through the needle, and the needle was removed. A 5 
___ vascular sheath was placed over the wire and connected to 
a saline infusion (mixed with heparin 500 units in 500 cc of 
saline) with a continuous drip. Through the sheath, a 4 ___ 
___ catheter was introduced and connected to a continuous 
saline infusion (mixed with heparin 1000 units in 1000 cc of 
saline). The following vessels were selectively catheterized, 
and arteriograms were performed from the following locations: 
Right common carotid artery, right internal carotid artery, left 
vertebral artery, left common carotid artery, and left internal 
carotid artery. After review of the study, the catheter and the 
sheath were withdrawn. Hemostasis was achieved using manual 
compression. The patient tolerated the procedure well without 
any immediate post-procedure complications.

FINDINGS:

RIGHT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY: The bifurcation is normal. There is 
no evidence of a vascular malformation.

RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: The cervical, petrous, cavernous, 
and supraclinoid segments of the internal carotid artery are 
normal. There is a surgical clip identified in the region of the 
anterior communicating artery with no residual aneurysm 
identified. There is mild stenosis of the M1 segment of the 
middle cerebral artery and moderate stenosis of the M2 middle 
cerebral artery branches. Additionally there is moderate 
stenosis of the A1 segment of the anterior cerebral artery with 
a focus of luminal irregularity in its proximal portion. There 
is decreased parenchymal phase blood flow identified within the 
right anterior watershed vascular distribution.

At this point, the decision was made for an intervention. 5 mg 
of verapamil was gently infused selectively into the right 
internal carotid artery over 1 minute. A right internal carotid 
artery angiogram was then repeated at approximately 10 minutes 
after the infusion of verapamil which demonstrated residual 
mild-to-moderate narrowing of the right A1 segment of the 
anterior cerebral artery, and right M1 and M2 segments of the 
middle cerebral artery.

LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY: The left vertebral artery and the left 
posterior inferior cerebellar artery appear unremarkable. There 
is no reflux identified into the right vertebral artery. The 
basilar artery appears unremarkable.

5 mg of verapamil was gently infused selectively into the left 
vertebral artery over ___AROTID ARTERY: The bifurcation is normal. There is 
no vascular malformation.

LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: The cervical, petrous, cavernous, 
and supraclinoid segments of the left internal carotid artery 
are normal. There is mild narrowing of the A1 segment of the 
left anterior cerebral artery. The left middle cerebral artery 
as well as its major branches appear unremarkable. A surgical 
clip is identified in the region of the anterior communicating 
artery with no residual aneurysm seen.

5 mg of verapamil was gently infused selectively into the left 
internal carotid artery over 1 minute. A post-infusion angiogram 
the left internal carotid artery demonstrates mild narrowing of 
the A1 segment of the anterior cerebral artery.

MODERATE SEDATION: 100 mcg of intravenous Fentanyl and 4 mg of 
intravenous Versed were administered in divided doses by a 
registered nurse, who was monitoring the patient throughout the 
2 hour and 15 minute intraservice time. Please refer to the 
nursing record for further detail.

IMPRESSION:
1. Status post surgical clipping of an anterior communicating 
aneurysm with no residual aneurysm identified.

2. Moderate narrowing of the right M1 and M2 segments of the 
middle cerebral artery and right A1 anterior cerebral artery, 
and mild narrowing of the left A1 segment of the anterior 
cerebral artery consistent with vasospasm. 5 mg of verapamil was 
selectively infused into the right internal carotid, left 
vertebral, and left internal carotid arteries for a total of 15 
mg of verapamil. Post- infusion angiogram demonstrated residual 
mild-to- moderate narrowing of the right M1 and M2 segments of 
the middle cerebral artery and right A1 segment of the anterior 
cerebral artery and residual mild narrowing of the A1 segment of 
the anterior cerebral artery.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of ___  1:55:18 ___

HISTORY: ___ female with headache for ten days and 
transferred from outside hospital with subarachnoid hemorrhage.

COMPARISON: No prior exam is available for comparison.

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the 
brain without contrast material. Subsequently, rapid axial 
imaging was performed through the brain during infusion of IV 
Optiray contrast material. Multiplanar maximum intensity 
projection images were then obtained. 3D volume-rendered images 
are pending.

CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Regions of high density along the 
right sulci, the basal cisterns, and the suprasellar cisterns 
are consistent with subarachnoid hemorrhage on the right. There 
is extension of this hyperdense material into the sella. There 
is mild hydrocephalus. Otherwise, there is no evidence of mass, 
edema, shift of normally midline structures, or large vascular 
territory infarction. No fractures are seen. The frontal sinuses 
are not pneumatized. Otherwise, the paranasal sinuses and the 
mastoid air cells are clear.

CTA HEAD: There is an 8 x 5 mm anterior communicating artery 
aneurysm which points inferoposteriorly in the suprasellar 
region and extends into the sella. Slight attenuation of the 
right more than left middle cerebral arteries may represent 
vasospasm. No other aneurysm is seen. The carotid and vertebral

# OSH ERCP (___): The major papilla was normal. The bile 
duct was deeply cannulated. Contrast was injected. I personally 
interpreted the bile duct images. Ductal flow of contrast was 
adequate. Imagequality was adequate. Contrast extended to the 
main bile duct. Contrast extended to the cystic duct. Contrast 
extended to  the hepatic ducts. A long cystic duct stump 
originated in the
lower third of the main bile duct. The lower third of the main 
bile duct contained one stone. The main bile duct was dilated. 
Biliary sphincterotomy was made with a traction (standard) 
sphincterotome using ___ electrocautery. There was no 
post-sphincterotomy bleeding. The biliary tree was swept with a 
11.5 mm balloon and basket starting at the bifurcation. Sludge 
was swept from the duct. A few stones were removed. Pus was 
coming out of the ampulla. One stone remained. The basket got 
stuck with the stone in the bile duct and the wire broke 
proximally instead of breaking around the stone. 
Post Procedure Diagnosis:
     - The major papilla appeared normal.
     - The patient has had a cholecystectomy.
     - The entire main bile duct was dilated.
     - Choledocholithiasis with a partial obstruction was found.
Partial removal was accomplished by biliary sphincterotomy; no 
stent was inserted. 
Complications: Unable to remove basket with one wire coming out 
of the mouth 
.
# OSH CT abd/pelvic (___): Mild diffuse thickening of the 
gastric  antrum, which can be seen in  the setting of gastritis. 
 2. Uterine fibroids. 

# ERCP (___): The scout film showed an impacted wire basket. The 
bile duct was deeply cannulated with the sphincterotome. 
Contrast was injected and there was brisk flow through the 
ducts. Contrast extended to the entire biliary tree. The wire 
basket was seen in the distal CBD. The left and right hepatic 
ducts and all intrahepatic branches were normal. To facilitate 
removal of the basket, a sphincteroplasty was made with a CRE 
balloon from 12 mm to 15 mm.  The biliary tree was then swept 
with a balloon above the impacted basket. The wire basket was 
removed from the patient. Stones were also extracted. A ___ x 5 
cm double pigtail stent was placed in the main duct. Excellent 
bile and contrast drainage was seen endoscopically and 
fluoroscopically

 
Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT & PLAN: ___ year old female with h/o DM, HTN, HLD, h/o 
gallstones s/p remote CCY in ___ who presents with 
n/v/abdominal pain/diarrhea/fevers found to have obstructive 
choledolithiasis and cholangitis s/p ERCP with removal of some 
stones but then the basket got stuck with the stone in the bile 
duct and the wire
broke proximally.
.
# OBSTRUCTIVE CHOLEDOLITHIASIS, CHOLANGITIS, RETAINED BASKET 
WIRE. Ms. ___ was admitted s/p ERCP (done at ___ 
Endoscopy) for cholangitis - however course was complicated by 
the retention of basket wire within the distal CBD.  She 
underwent ERCP here where sphincteroplasty was performed, basket 
wire was retrieved along with multiple CBD stones.  A CBD stent 
was placed to expedite clearance of any remaining stones/sludge. 

   She presented with leukocytosis, elevated LFTs, RUQ abd pain, 
pus from the CBD duct c/w cholangitis.  For this, she was 
treated with IV unasyn along with IV dilaudid and zofran PRN for 
pain/nausea control.  She did well after the ERCP procedure - 
and was able to tolerate a regular diet the same day.  She will 
need to complete 5 more day of ciprofloxacin and flagyl.  Due to 
loose stool and diarrhea (and recent iv antibiotics), the 
concern was for the possibility of C.diff.  Stool c.diff were 
sent - and extra doses of flagyl were prescribed in case the 
stool studies returned positive.  She should not take any 
aspirin, Plavix, NSAIDS, Coumadin for the following 5 days.  She 
will need a repeat ERCP 4 weeks for stent pull and 
re-evaluation. 

# GASTRITIS:  Ms. ___ had a positive H pylori test at OSH.  
Abd CT also revealed with diffuse thickening of the antrum 
consistent with gastritis.  A 14-day prescription of PPI, 
Clarithromycin and Amoxicilli was given for treatment of H. 
Pylori.  Since this is not urgent, she (through her daughter) 
understands that this need not be immediately treated and may be 
postponed until the cholangitis is fully treated (and prospect 
of C.diff is eliminated). 

# DIABETES MELLITUS - last Hgb A1C 6.5 not on medications at 
home.  She was placed on ISS here along with diabetic diet.

# HTN/HLD: HCTZ/toprol/lisinpril were continued.  Lipitor can be 
resumed on d/c.

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure looking after you, Ms. ___.  As you know, 
you underwent an ERCP here to retrieve the wire basket stuck in 
the common bile duct.  You tolerated the ERCP here well: the 
wire was removed along with the stones within the common bile 
duct.  A bile duct stent was also placed to ensure adequate 
passage of biliary stones.   
   Please complete 5 days of ciprofloxacin and flagyl 
(antibiotics) to treat the infection within the bile duct.  
Thereafter, you can start the other antibiotics (prilosec, 
amoxicillin, clarithromycin) to treat H.Pylori.  Since treatment 
of H.Pylori is not urgent, you may elect to delay the H.Pylori 
treatment until there is enough time to recover from the 
cholangitis and ensure that you are not infected with C.diff.  
We will contact you with the stool Cdiff results. 
   You will be contacted by our ERCP department to schedule a 
follow up ERCP to remove the stent.

Brief Hospital Course:
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
====================
[ ] Chest pain - unclear if of cardiac etiology or otherwise. If 
this is deemed to be of cardiac origin, initiation of a 
long-acting nitrate can be considered as blood pressures allow
[ ] Positive MIBI - patient should follow up with a cardiologist 
to decide whether elective cardiac catheterization is necessary 
following a recent MIBI with a small area of decreased perfusion 
that reversed with rest
[ ] Started on Aspirin - discussed w/ ___. Pt okay to be on 
ASA. Felt it has benefit for her primary prophylaxis in CAD. 

___ year old female with DMII, HTN, HLD, history of ICH w/ 
residual R-sided blindness and a recent stress MIBI suggestive 
of a small area of decrease perfusion that reversed with rest 
presented from her PCPs office with chest pain concerning for a 
coronary etiology.

ACTIVE PROBLEMS
================
# Chest Pain
The patient presented with chest pain that she described as 
""pressure"" in her neck. Given concern for coronary artery 
disease, troponins were checked (negative x3) and EKGs were 
obtained (no acute ischemic changes). A more robust history was 
elicited, which suggested that she feels this chest pain 
intermittently (no daily but several times per week) and has not 
noted any correlation with rest or exercise. She takes her 
sublingual nitroglycerin when she is feeling pain, which helps 
sometimes but not always. She also recalls some events that were 
relieved with rest and some that lasted for several hours. Based 
on this, it remains unclear if her chest pain is coronary in 
origin. She also had an echocardiogram that was unremarkable. 
Given the negative objective work up and the very questionable 
history of her chest pain, cardiac catheterization was deferred 
at this time. Her metoprolol succinate and lisinopril were 
continued, and she was started on 81mg aspirin daily (after 
consultation with neurosurgery). Consideration was made to 
initiate nitrate therapy, however he blood pressures remained 
too soft. This can be further considered in the outpatient 
setting.

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS
========================
# DMII - held metformin while inpatient and initiated Humalog 
sliding scale

# HTN - held HCTZ in favor of lisinopril and metoprolol

# HLD - continued atorvastatin

# Anxiety - continued Wellbutrin 100mg BID

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with a PMH of Hypertension, 
IDDM, Peripheral Neuropathy, Sleep Apnea, Renal failure, PVD, 
GOUT, Coronary Artery Disease(CAD)GAMMOPATHY, Colonic Polyps, 
Diabetic Neuropathy, Anemia, Peptic Ulcer Disease (PUD)Restless 
Leg Syndrome, Osteomyelitis, Charcot foot, basal cell carcinoma, 
ischemic cardiomyopathy, Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA). He has 
a history of left behind knee popliteal stent with recurrent, 
nonhealing, wound of L foot. He was admitted to this floor with 
a nonhealing left midfoot plantar ulcer. After clinical 
evaluation the decision was made to perform a left lower 
extremity angiography, revealing this findings:
1. Patent infrarenal abdominal aorta.
2. Patent bilateral iliac systems.
3. Patent left common femoral artery and profunda femoris.
    There is evidence of high-grade focal stenosis at the
    origin of the SFA caused by calcified plaque.  The
    remainder of the SFA is diseased, but otherwise patent.
    Distally in the SFA at the level of ___ canal,
    there is a ___ area with at least 2 areas of focal
    stenosis.
4. The left popliteal artery is occluded at the level of
    the previously placed stent behind the knee.
5. The remainder of the popliteal artery appears to fill
    retrograde via a collateral.
6. The left anterior tibial artery and peroneal arteries
    provide collateral flow to the foot; however, the
    anterior tibial artery is diseased proximally.
7. There is no true dorsalis pedis or posterior tibialis in
    the foot.

With these findings, the decision was made to reestablish 
vascularity with a left lower extremity femoral-peroneal bypass 
utilizing great saphenous vein graft from the same leg. He 
tolerated well the procedure and had an uneventful postoperative 
course, to ___ he has positive left ___ and peroneal 
signals.

small stone and probable adenomyomatosis. No distension or 
pericholecystic 
fluid to suggest active inflammation. 
4. Minimally dilated common bile duct. No intrahepatic biliary 
ductal 
dilatation. 

___ CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
1. Large loculated left pleural effusion measures up to 14.6 x 
5.0 cm in 
greatest dimension. 
2. Adjacent to the loculated left pleural effusion there is 
opacification 
which may represent relaxation atelectasis, however 
infection/aspiration 
cannot be excluded. 
3. Right axillary, mediastinal and upper abdominal 
lymphadenopathy is 
consistent with known history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. 
4. Non-obstructing nephrolithiasis of the kidneys measuring up 
to 4 mm. 
  
___ CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION: 
1. Overall improvement of pre-vascular and retroperitoneal 
lymphadenopathy in comparison with ___.  Severe 
infiltrative upper and lower 
paratracheal mediastinal adenopathy grossly unchanged in bulk,, 
but there is  less narrowing around of central bronchi.  No 
apparent mass effect on the SVC. 
2. Interlobular septal thickening has increased.  This in 
combination with 
peribronchial thickening and bilateral pleural effusions suggest 
worsening 
pulmonary edema. 
3. Multiple stable pulmonary nodules measuring up to 7 mm.  
Attention on 
follow-up is recommended, if appropriate. 

___ VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW
Aspiration with thin liquids and penetration with thin and 
nectar thick 
liquids. 
  
___ CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION: 
1. Several centrilobular ground-glass opacities along the 
periphery of the 
right lung are new since the prior study.  Findings are 
nonspecific and likely represent infection or inflammation of 
lower airways, but these new opacities are not extensive. 
2. Continued mild improvement in Findings associated with 
neoplastic disease in the chest. 
3. Interlobular septal thickening, likely secondary to moderate 
pulmonary 
edema, appears stable.  Etiology may be due to lymphatic outflow 
obstruction rather than congestive heart failure, however, given 
infiltrative hilar masses. 
4. Multiple bilateral nodules measuring up to 7 mm are similar 
in size to the prior study from ___, however underlying 
malignancy cannot be excluded. These nodules can be reviewed in 
follow-up imaging. 

___ CXR
IMPRESSION:  
In comparison with the study ___, there is increased 
opacification at the right base with silhouetting of the 
hemidiaphragm, most likely reflecting pleural effusion with 
atelectatic changes.  Less prominent effusion and atelectasis 
are seen on the left.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. 
Although it is difficult to determine a specific area of 
consolidation, given the extensive changes described above it 
would be difficult to unequivocally exclude superimposed 
pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral view. The 
multiple nodular opacifications seen on CT are beyond the 
resolution limits of plain radiographs.  Similarly, it is 
difficult to described the septal thickening seen at CT. 

___ RUE ULTRASOUND
No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the right upper 
extremity.

___ BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY VEIN ULTRASOUND
Limited evaluation of the calf veins.  No evidence of acutedeep 
venous 
thrombosis in the right or left lower extremity veins.   
Multiple wall 
calcifications within the right popliteal vein are seen.  
Notably, the 
previous echogenic focus within the left popliteal vein was not 
seen on 
today's examination. 

___ VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW
Aspiration with thin and nectar thick liquids, and consistent 
penetration with thin and nectar thick liquids. Please note that 
a detailed description of dynamic swallowing as well as a 
summative assessment and recommendations are reported separately 
in a standalone note by the Speech-Language Pathologist (OMR, 
Notes, Rehabilitation Services). 

PATHOLOGY:
======================

___ LYMPH NODE BIOPSY
SPECIMEN: LYMPH NODE, RIGHT AXILLARY, CORE NEEDLE BIOPSY.
DIAGNOSIS:
HIGH GRADE B-CELL LYMPHOMA, NOS, WITH IGH/BCL2 REARRANGEMENT. 
SEE NOTE.
Note: Sections of a core lymph node biopsy show three distinct 
areas comprising roughly a third of the core biopsy each. One 
zone shows a lymphoid proliferation composed almost entirely of 
medium size and large lymphocytes with irregularly shaped 
nuclei, blastic chromatin, small amounts of cytoplasm and 
inconspicuous nucleoli. Frequent mitoses, including atypical 
mitoses and apoptotic cells are seen. The second zone shows a 
proliferation of smaller lymphocytes with round nuclei, blastic 
chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli in a background of loose 
connective tissue. Yet a third zone shows complete coagulative 
necrosis. By immunohistochemistry, CD20 highlights B-cells 
occupying the vast majority of the viable tissue. CD3 and CD5 
highlights scattered interspersed T-cells and few dense large 
aggregates. CD10 is variably positive, it stain the lymphocytes 
in the zone containing medium and large cells, but not the one 
primarily made up of small lymphocytes. MUM is variably positive 
and BCL6 is diffusely positive. BCL2 is immunoreactive in all 
lymphocytes. CD21 highlights scattered background follicular 
dendritic cell meshwork remnants. CD23 and BCL1 are negative. By 
Ki67 (MIB1) staining, the proliferation index is variable, with 
the zone of larger cells showing 90-100% staining, and 70-80% in 
the zone dominated by small blastic lymphocytes. Immunostains 
for CMYC shows staining in an average of 20% of cells.
FISH: POSITIVE for IGH/BCL2 and GAIN of MYC. Approximately 50% 
of the interphase right
axillary lymph node cells examined in this high grade lymphoma 
FISH panel had probe signal
patterns consistent with ___ extra intact copies of MYC and the 
IGH/BCL2 gene rearrangement
characteristic of follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma of germinal center origin.
There was no evidence of rearrangements of the BCL6 and MYC 
genes.

___ IMMUNOPHENOTYPING
INTERPRETATION 
Nondiagnostic study. Cell marker analysis was performed, but was 
nondiagnostic in this case due to insufficient numbers of 
cells/insufficient amount of tissue for analysis. Clonality 
could not be assessed in this case due to insufficient numbers 
of B cells. If clinically indicated, we recommend a repeat 
specimen be submitted to the flow cytometry laboratory. 
Correlation with clinical, morphologic (see separate pathology 
report ___-___) and other ancillary (see separate cytogenetics 
report ___-___) findings is recommended. Flow cytometry 
immunophenotyping may not detect all abnormal populations due to 
topography, sampling or artifacts of sample preparation.

___ PLEURAL FLUID
Nonspecific T cell predominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic 
immunophenotypic features of involvement by leukemia/lymphoma 
are not seen in this specimen. Correlation with clinical, 
morphologic (see separate pathology report ___-___) and other 
ancillary (see separate cytogenetics report ___) findings 
is recommended. Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may not detect 
all abnormal populations due to topography, sampling or 
artifacts of sample preparation.

___ IMMUNOTYPING 
Nondiagnostic study. Cell marker analysis was performed, but was

was stopped upon count recovery. He initially received 
allopurinol for TLS prophylaxis which was subsequently 
discontinued due to transaminitis. Given poor toleration of 
da-EPOCH, he was started on R-CHOP for cycle 2 which he received 
on ___ with plan for further chemotherapy as outpatient. He was 
started on filgrastim and allopurinol on ___, but filgrastim was 
stopped a few days later following a robust increase in WBC. He

Patient found to have large left effusion on CT after CXR for 
PICC placement demonstrated effusion. He underwent chest tube 
placement on ___ which drained 1L fluid and was subsequently 
removed on ___. Pleural fluids studies were exudative effusion, 
cytology negative for malignant cells however FISH positive 
suggestive of disease involvement. Pleural fluid cx negative. 
Additionally, he had significant wheezing on exam though no 
documented history of COPD. He underwent PFTs ___ notable for 
FEV1/FVC ratio 69% consistent with COPD. He was started on daily 
tiotropium and scheduled duonebs. He continued to have 
productive cough with crackles and rhonchi on exam. He had CT 
chest ___ showing pulmonary congestion that improved with 
diuresis. Repeat CT chest ___ showed continued congestion and 
nonspecific opacities, and he was started on metronidazole for 
possible aspiration pneumonia and completed a coarse from 
___. He was discharged on advair and tiotropium for his 
COPD. He should follow up with his PCP for further evaluation, 
consideration of referral to a pulmonologist. 

# CAD s/p stenting:
# Hx PVD s/p left femoral-peroneal bypass:
# HTN:
Per pt, most recent stent ___ year ago. Cardiology was consulted 
for cardio-onc evaluation given plan for chemo regimen with 
anthracyclines as above. Baseline TTE was obtained which 
demonstrated normal EF. He will require repeat echo within ___ 
months after the completion of anthracyclines and outpatient 
follow-up with Dr. ___ in cardio-oncology. Additionally, his 
home metoprolol was transitioned to carvedilol for 
cardioprotective and antihypertensive effect. His home 
antiplatelet regimen (Plavix QOD) was discussed with cardiology, 
vascular medicine, and vascular surgery. Per vascular surgery 
there was no indication from their standpoint for antiplatelet 
agent. Plavix was held in setting of thrombocytopenia. There was 
plan to begin aspirin, which was initially held given multiple 
procedures (LP, port replacement). He was asymptomatic and blood 
pressure remained controlled BP 110-120/60-70 until discharge. 
His aspirin and Plavix were held at discharge given he will be 
receiving further chemotherapy, with plan to rediscuss starting 
them as outpatient.

# E. coli Bacteremia:
He spiked a fever to 101 on ___ and blood cultures were 
positive for E.coli. He was started on cefepime, narrowed to 
ceftriaxone, given sensitive to E.coli (cipro and Bactrim 
resistant). He remained hemodynamically stable and afebrile 
until discharge with ___ services and line care to complete the 
2-week ceftriaxone course until ___. 
[ ] continue IV ceftriaxone (2wk, ___

# Aspiration risk: He presented with a hoarse voice; no 
respiratory symptoms aside from coughing. He was evaluated by 
ENT which found left vocal cord paralysis in the setting of 
hilar and mediastinal adenopathy and soft tissue encasing the 
trachea. A video swallow was performed and showed aspiration 
with thin and nectar thick liquids. He was kept on thick liquids 
using a straw with chin tuck. He was recommended to follow-up 
with ENT as an outpatient for vocal cord injection. Repeat video 
swallow was unchanged from prior. After goals of care discussion 
with patient and his wife, he was discharged home with an 
understanding of aspiration risk. He should follow up with ENT 
for further management.

He developed transaminitis while in house. It was felt to be 
most likely secondary to chemotherapy. RUQUS w/ Doppler 
unremarkable. HBV, HCV serologies were negative on admission. 
EBV/CMV viral load and serologies were negative. His 
allopurinol, home statin, and Tylenol were held in the setting 
of transaminitis. His liver function tests returned to normal at 
discharge.

# RUE PICC-associated DVT:
He was found to have a RUE PICC associated DVT, of which the 
PICC was subsequently removed. LENIS with question of chronic 
non-occlusive thrombus within popliteal vein. This was discussed 
with vascular medicine and there was initially a plan to 
reimage, however he was subsequently started on enoxaparin for 
the RUE DVT. Repeat RUE ultrasound and LENIS several weeks later 
showed no evidence of clot. Given no indication for 
anticoagulation, his enoxaparin was discontinued.

# ___ on CKD III
Cr 3.1 on presentation. Baseline Cr unknown, most recently 2.3 
in ___. Suspect pre-renal in the setting of hypercalcemia. 
Renal US was obtained which was unremarkable. Cr subsequently

PERTINENT IMAGING
===================
CTA CHEST ___:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic 
abnormality. 
2. Fairly diffuse ground-glass airspace opacification with a 
gravitational 
distribution as well as interlobular septal thickening is 
slightly increased 
compared to prior suggesting increasing interstitial (early 
alveolar) edema. 
3. Left pleural effusion is slightly increased in size. 
4.   Extensive mediastinal as well as right axillary adenopathy 
appears 
decreased over serial CT studies. 
5. Bilateral pulmonary nodules some of which are stable, others 
decreased in 
size.  No new or enlarging pulmonary nodules. 
6.   Endobronchial plugging, predominantly in the lower lobe 
airways, is 
likely secondary to aspiration/retained secretions. 

TTE ___
The left atrial volume index is normal. The estimated right 
atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is normal left
ventricular wall thickness with a normal cavity size. There is 
SEVERE regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with hypo/akinesis in the mid to apical

moderately depressed. The visually estimated
left ventricular ejection fraction is ___. Left ventricular 
cardiac index is normal (>2.5 L/min/m2).
There is Grade II diastolic dysfunction. Normal right 
ventricular cavity size with normal free wall motion. The
aortic sinus diameter is normal for gender with normal ascending 
aorta diameter for gender. The aortic arch
diameter is normal with a normal descending aorta diameter. The 
aortic valve leaflets (?#) are mildly
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 
1.5-1.9 cm2). There is no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets appear structurally normal with no mitral 
valve prolapse. There is mild [1+] mitral
regurgitation. The pulmonic valve leaflets are normal. The 
tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal.
There is trivial tricuspid regurgitation. There is mild 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: 1) Severe regional LV systolic dysfunction wtih 
moderate reduction on global LV
function c/w prior myocardial infarction in mid to distal LAD 
territory. 2) Mild aortic stenosis. 3)
Stretched PFO versus very distal in the intreratrial septum 
located ASD with left to right shunting.
It appears that the shunt is not hemodynamically significant 
however due to its location
consideration for further work up could be made with either 
cardiac MRI or TEE.
Compared with the prior TTE ___ , LAD infarct is new. 
Left to right shunt probably present on prior
study however image quality much improved on current study.

CXR ___:
IMPRESSION: 
There is a right chest wall Port-A-Cath with the tip terminating 
in the
superior vena cava. There is a small left pleural effusion. 
Linear opacities in the left lung base most likely represent a 
combination of subsegmental atelectasis and aspiration 
pneumonitis. There is no new consolidation or pneumothorax. The 
cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  There is 
central pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary 
edema. Atherosclerotic calcifications of the thoracic aorta are 
noted.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.

Video swallow ___:
IMPRESSION: 
Silent aspiration with thin and nectar thick liquids.

CXR ___:
IMPRESSION: 
There is a right-sided Port-A-Cath with distal tip at the 
cavoatrial junction. There has been worsening of the basilar 
opacities particularly on the left side since previous.  There 
is a small left-sided pleural effusion.  There are no 
pneumothoraces.

CT Chest ___:
IMPRESSION: 
Despite persistent severe central adenopathy there is no 
appreciable
compromise of vital structures.

CT Abdomen/pelvis ___:
IMPRESSION:
1. 1.1 cm retrocrural lymph node which is similar to the CT 
examination from
___ but slightly decreased in size since ___.
2. 2.2 cm soft tissue nodule immediately deep to the umbilicus 
could represent
scar or focal fibrosis, but is nonspecific.  There are no prior 
comparison
studies to assess for stability.
3. There is a 4 mm nonobstructing stone within the midpole of 
the left kidney.
4. Please refer dedicated CT chest for additional findings.

CXR ___:
IMPRESSION: 
In comparison with the study of the ___, the 
cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Continued and possibly 
increasing pulmonary edema.  Opacification at the left base is 
consistent with pleural fluid and atelectatic changes. The right 
hemidiaphragmatic contour is sharply seen, though there may be 
mild blunting of the costophrenic angle. Although all of this 
appearance could be related to pulmonary edema, in the 
appropriate clinical setting it would be difficult to exclude 
superimposed aspiration/pneumonia, especially in the absence of 
a lateral view.

CXR ___:
IMPRESSION: 
Mild interval increase in volume of a left pleural effusion as 
well as
subjacent atelectasis.

___ ___:
IMPRESSION: 
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the left lower 
extremity veins.

CXR ___:
IMPRESSION: 
A right chest Wall Port-A-Cath tip projects over the right 
atrium, unchanged. There is a moderate left pleural effusion 
with subjacent opacities which may reflect atelectasis or 
pneumonia.  New pulmonary vascular congestion is present since 
prior. There is no pneumothorax or large right pleural effusion. 
The size of the cardiac silhouette is suboptimally evaluated 
given the abnormalities in the left hemithorax.

PET ___
IMPRESSION: 1. Relative to description of findings from PET-CT 
on ___, there has been interval decrease in FDG avidity 
of supraclavicular, right axillary, mediastinal, and hilar 
lymphadenopathy.  No FDG avid paraesophageal, epicardial, 
retroperitoneal, or internal mammary lymphadenopathy are noted. 
Size of lymph node conglomerates is overall minimally decreased 
compared to CT examinations from ___. 2. Retrocrural 
lymph node measures 1.2 x 1.2 cm with minimal FDG avidity an SUV 
max of 1.7. 3. Minimally FDG avid nodule deep to the umbilicus 
with SUV max of 2.0, nonspecific.  This finding is likely 
chronic and not related to malignancy. Attention on follow-up. 
4. 3 areas of ground-glass opacification and FDG avidity in both 
lungs are new compared to CT chest on ___.  As such, 
infection/inflammation is favored over malignancy.  Attention on 
follow-up is recommended. 5. Patulous, FDG avid 
esophagus is suggestive esophagitis. 6. Interval increase in now 
moderate left pleural effusion. 7. Unchanged 4 mm nonobstructing 
left renal stone. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:

PATIENT SUMMARY:
====================
Mr. ___ is a ___ yo male with a history of DLBCL s/p recent 
da-EPOCH and 2 cycles of RCHOP, CAD s/p prior PCI, PAD, CKD, 
DM2, HTN. He was recently discharged from the ___ service on 
___ after a lengthy stay c/b pleural effusion, PICC 
associated DVT, E coli bacteremia, VRE UTI, and L vocal cord 
paralysis. On ___ had syncopal event at home and presented to 
___ where he was found to have an NSTEMI and newly reduced EF to 
35% and emergent cardiac angiogram showing 3VD. He was 
transferred to ___ on ___ for possible CABG. At ___ his HFrEF 
medications were adjusted within the limitations of his low SBPs 
and intermittent orthostatic hypotension. He was worked up with 
viability testing but C-surg evaluated him and he was determined 
not to be a candidate for CABG based on active DLBCL. The 
interventional cardiology team was consulted and on ___ he 
underwent PCI with DES to LAD without complication. His course 
was complicated by few days of neutropenia requiring neutropenic 
precautions but with ANC recovered with neupogen. Per primary 
oncologist's recommendation, patient was transferred to bone 
marrow transplant team for further chemotherapy. His cycle was 
delayed due to severe orthostatic hypotension, but he was 
eventually given rituximab ___, and started on CEP ___. He 
tolerated chemotherapy well, and was kept through his nadir. His 
course was complicated by neutropenic fever, for which he 
completed a seven day course of antibiotics.

====================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[ ] DAPT: needs to stay on dual antiplatelet therapy for at 
least one year for stent placement on ___. If there is need 
to stop prior, please contact ___, MD 
cardiology attending, for recommendations 
[ ] Platelets must remain above 30 for ___ year in order to 
continue DAPT 
[ ] Consider adding ___ for GDMT iso HFrEF if BP 
improves and he no longer requires midodrine
[ ] Close follow up of blood pressures given he was 
intermittently orthostatic during his admission.
[ ] If weight increases by > 3 lb, increase torsemide to 60 mg 
daily and repeat chemistry panel the following day. If weight 
decreases by more than 3 lb, decrease to torsemide 20 mg daily.

====================
ACUTE ISSUES:
====================
#High Grade Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma w/ BCL2 Rearrangement
#Neutropenia, ANC 600 ___, now resolved
Mr. ___ was initially diagnosed on ___ via 
thoracentesis and R axillary core biopsy. He follows with Dr. 
___ and is s/p da-EPOCH with intrathecal 
methotrexate, and 2 cycles of CHOP. After admission to ___ due 
to NSTEMI (see below), patient was transferred to ___ for 
further chemotherapy, which was delayed due to severe 
orthostatic hypotension and in light of recent NSTEMI. Patient 
was given rituximab ___, and started CEP ___. Vincristine was 
not given due to likely autonomic dysfunction causing 
orthostatic hypotension and anthracyclines were avoided given 
HFrEF. Patient tolerated the chemotherapy well, and was kept 
through nadir. He was continued on his prophylactic acyclovir 
and atovaquone. Repeat PET on ___ showed substantial decrease 
in FDG uptake, suggesting good response to chemo. 

#Febrile neutropenia
While neutropenic, he developed a fever without a localizing 
source. Aspiration pneumonia was possible given high aspiration 
risk but CXR was without major changes. GI infection was 
possible given diarrhea but C.diff/stool cultures were negative, 
he was without abdominal pain, and the diarrhea had been 
improving. Soft tissue/skin infection was also possible with L 
upper thigh rash, but rash had also been improving. Cultures 
were negative. He was started on vanc/cefepime/flagyl, and 
ultimately transitioned to Levaquin. He then completed a seven 
day course of antibiotics. 

#Orthostatic Hypotension
He was having baseline SBP 90-100s, which would lower to SBP 
60-70s upon standing. The ddx for his orthostatic hypotension 
was thought to be due to poor PO intake, autonomic dysfunction 
(amitriptyline, carbidopa/levodopa, diabetes), and vincristine. 
He was started on midodrine 7.5mg TID, medications that could 
effect BPs (amitriptyline and carbidopa/levodopa) were 
discontinued, and vincristine was avoided. His AM cortisol was 
within normal limits. His SBPs improved and were in the ___ 
upon discharge. 

#NSTEMI 
#CAD 
He presented to ___ with syncope and was found to have elevated 
troponin with non-specific ST wave changes, had a TTE with new 
EF 35% so had emergent coronary angiogram demonstrating 3vdz 
(ostial left main (70%) and mid-80% tubular stenosis of the 
LAD.) It was unclear if underlying CAD had acutely worsened in 
the setting of recent cardiotoxic chemotherapy including 
doxorubicin. He was worked up with thallium viability testing 
but C-surg evaluated him and he was determined to be not a 
candidate for CABG based on active DLBCL. The interventional 
cardiology team was consulted and on ___ he underwent PCI via 
right femoral access with IVUS of LMCA showing eccentric calcium 
with MLA of 9 mm2. He had severe heavily calcified disease of 
proximal LAD successfully treated with rotational atherectomy 
and 1 DES. He was started on DAPT (minimum ___ year duration). He 
was continued on atorvastatin 80mg daily. He was not able to 
tolerate ___ in setting of low SBPs.

#Acute Decompensated HFrEF 
#ischemic cardiomyopthy
He was found to have with a newly reduced EF to 35% from prior 
65% with WMA at ___. The etiology of heart failure was likely 
ischemic given NSTEMI and cardiac angiogram showed three vessel 
disease. However he had also recently received anthracyclines as 
a part of his chemotherapy regimen which could have contributed. 
During his stay he was treated with IV Lasix for preload mgmt 
and transitioned to Lasix 20mg PO on discharge. For afterload 
reduction he was treated with Carvedilol but given intermittent 
orthostatic hypotension with reported lightheadedness, this was 
changed to metoprolol succinate on ___. He was not started on 
an ___ in setting of poor renal function and low blood 
pressures, but this could be considered as an outpatient if his 
creatinine and BP improves. He was found to be significantly 
volume overloaded, and was diuresed with 80 mg IV Lasix daily 
for four days prior to being transitioned to 40mg torsemide 
daily. 

# Left vocal cord paralysis
# Aspiration risk
During his prior admission he was noted to have a hoarse voice 
but without respiratory symptoms aside from coughing. He was 
evaluated by ENT who found left vocal cord paralysis in the 
setting of hilar and mediastinal adenopathy and soft tissue 
encasing the trachea. During the current admission he was 
followed by speech and swallow who knew him from his last 
admission. He did not present with overt s/sx concerning for 
aspiration, but he has a history of SILENT aspiration (not 
coughing when aspirating). He was judged to be at an elevated 
risk of aspiration. Speech/swallow recommended nectar thick 
liquids and ground foods with 1:1 sitting. He was seen by ENT on 
___ for vocal cord injection. SLP repeat evaluation on ___ 
showed moderate improvement, and patient was switched to thin 
liquid and regular solid diet. 

====================
CHRONIC ISSUES:

# E. coli Bacteremia:
He had spiked a fever to 101 on ___ during his prior admission 
and blood cultures were positive for E.coli. He was started on 
cefepime, narrowed to ceftriaxone, given sensitive to E.coli. He 
was treated with ceftriaxone from ___. His urine cultures 
on ___ and ___ grew yeast, however he was asymptomatic and was 
not treated with antifungals per oncology recs.

#Persistent RUE swelling:
He had some swelling of his RUE at the beginning of his 
admission. He had a repeat RUE US ___ with no DVT. 

#CKD 
Unclear baseline as previously noted to be ~2, but Cr. was 1.6 
on admission thought to be ___ cardiorenal syndrome in setting

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,  

It was a privilege taking care of you at ___ 
___.  

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?  
- You were admitted to the hospital because you were having 
increased shortness of breath.

WHAT HAPPENED TO ME IN THE HOSPITAL?  
- You were initially admitted to the intensive care unit where 
you had several treatments to improve your breathing. You had 
the fluid drained from your lung with a needle (thoracentesis). 
You were given water pills to remove extra fluid from your 
lungs. You were also given inhaled medications to decrease the 
inflammation in your lungs and make it easier for you to breath. 
Your breathing improved with these treatments and you no longer 
required supplemental oxygen by the end of your hospital stay.
- You were given 5 days of antibiotics because we were 
suspicious that you might have an infection in your lungs 
(pneumonia) when you first came in. We sent several tests to 
look for an infection, however, and these all came back 
negative. Consequently, we stopped your antibiotics.
- Your water pill, torsemide, was decreased from 60 mg once a 
day to 20 mg once a day. 
- You blood pressure medication, midodrine, was stopped because 
your blood pressure was well controlled during your admission.

WHAT SHOULD I DO AFTER I LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?   
- Please weigh yourself every day. If your weight increases by > 
3 lb, increase your torsemide to 40 mg daily. If your weight 
decreases by more than 3 lb, stop taking your torsemide until 
your weight returns to normal. 
- If you start to become lightheaded when standing up from 
sitting, or you faint, please call your doctor to discuss 
re-starting midodrine.
- Please attend you oncology appointment on ___ at 9:00 
AM at the ___ on the ___ floor
- Please attend your appointment with the diabetes doctors on 
___ at 1:00 ___ at ___ located at ___ 
___, ___. ___. 
- Please make an appointment to see your PCP, ___, 
___ after leaving rehab.

We wish you the best.

History of Present Illness:
___ with dementia, ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 50%, CVA, DM, HTN, 
CKD, and newly diagnosed urothelial bladder CA admitted with 
increasing drowsiness over three weeks. According to the 
patient's son, he had been sleeping more and talking and eating 
less. His gait and behavior had been altered such that if the 
patient's son asks him to walk forward he walks backward and if 
asked to lift his tongue upward he moves it downward. His mental 
status and cognition have also been somewhat depressed. He was 
prescribed Ambien approx three weeks prior to admission for 
insomnia, however that was promptly discontinued when fatigue 
persisted. No other new medication changes. Although chronic 
urinary urgency had previously prompted the patient to ask for 
help to the bathroom, he has not been asking for assistance as 
of late. He completed a 10-day course of levofloxacin for 
pneumonia approximately one month before his admission. No 
history of fever, chills, headache, cough, chest pain, shortness 
of breath, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria, rash, 
weakness, numbness, parasthesias, or falls. The patient was 
being evaluated in neurology clinic on the day of admission 
where he was very somnolent but arousable, BP 90/50 HR 60 bpm. 
He was referred to the ED for further evaluation. In the ED, 
initial vital signs 98.5 63 146/56 18 99%RA. The patient was 
admitted to the medical service for further care.

Admission EKG: SB 56 bpm ___ deg AV cond delay. Normal axis no 
ST-T wave abnormalities. Not significantly changed from ___.
.
Head CT (___): IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute hemorrhage 
or shift of normally midline structures to suggest large mass. 
Please note that MRI is more sensitive in detection of acute 
ischemia or mass lesions. Given the extent of dilation of the 
lateral ventricles, possibility of NPH superimposed on volume 
loss changes needs to be considered and correlated clinically. 
.
Echo (___):
The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, 
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal 
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is 
not present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation 
is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is 
no pericardial effusion. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the previously mentioned inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis 
is not seen on the current report. The other findings are 
similar.  
.
Abdominal Ultrasound (___):
FINDINGS: There is no hydronephrosis identified in either 
kidney. The bladder is only partially distended. The solid mass 
is again seen within the lumen of the bladder measuring 2.4 x 
2.7 x 3.1 cm. This appears slightly larger than the ultrasound 
of ___ when this mass measured 2.2 x 1.9 x 1.9 cm. No 
additional masses identified within the region of the pelvis, 
however, ultrasound is limited in its ability to evaluate this 
area. 
IMPRESSION: 1) No hydronephrosis. 2) Solid bladder mass 
measuring 3.1 cm 
which is slightly larger than the prior ultrasound as described 
above. 3) No additional pelvic mass identified on limited 
imaging. 
.
Right ___ ultrasound (___):
COMPARISON: Right lower extremity ultrasound from ___. 
ULTRASOUND IMAGES OF THE RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY VEINS: The right 
common 
femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins demonstrate 
normal flow, 
compressibility and augmentation. The right peroneal veins are 
patent. The 
right posterior tibial veins are not definitively identified.
IMPRESSION: Limited study as the right posterior tibial veins 
were not 
definitively identified, otherwise no evidence of deep venous 
thrombosis. 
(Please note that these findings were similar to an ultrasound 
of the RLE performed on ___ for a similar indication).
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ male with dementia, ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 50%, DM, CKD, 
and relatively recent diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma/bladder 
mass, admitted with increasing fatigue and somnolence for three 
weeks, eventually thought most likely related to MRSA UTI.
.
#Fatigue/somnolence - A broad differential was considered, 
including possible toxic or metabolic causes. The patient's 
electrolytes were normalized and folate, B12, TSH, free T4, RPR, 
and LFTs (including ammonia) were all checked and were within 
normal limits. An initial infectious workup was negative. The 
neurology service was consulted as the patient was initially 
referred in from neurology clinic and due to concern of dilation 
of the lateral ventricles on head CT. Their impression was that 
an element of NPH was a possible contributing factor to the 
patient's presentation, but that this was unlikely to be the 
only cause. Additionally, effective evaluation of NPH would 
require the patient to be as well and stable as possible, and 
able to walk, so that he could undergo detailed testing before 
and after LP with CSF removal. An additional complication was 
that the question of NPH had been raised to the patient when he 
was more lucid, and he declined to undergo evaluation stating he 
would not want surgery for shunt placement. Outpatient neurology 
follow-up was suggested. After several days in the hospital the 
patient developed a fever, and an ongoing infectious work-up was 
continued. A urine culture eventually grew out >100,000 colonies 
of MRSA. With treatment of this infection, the patient's mental 
status improved significantly, although his overall level of 
interaction and verbal communication remained fairly low. Per 
his son, this was close to his initial baseline several weeks 
before the deterioration leading to his admission. It seems 
likely that an element of depression may also be contributing to 
the patient's overall picture; consideration was given to 
possible initiation of pharmacotherapy (such as methylphenidate 
or mirtazapine), however ultimately this was deferred, at least 
temporarily, while the patient's other medical issues reach 
resolution.
.  
#Fevers/UTI: Beginning on the patient's third hospital day, he 
began experiencing fevers. An infectious work-up, including two 
UAs, was non-revealing. He received approximately two days of 
empiric vancomycin and Zosyn out of concern for impending 
clinical deterioration. Eventually his urine culture grew MRSA, 
and this was felt to be the source of his fevers. He was at risk 
for MRSA having had urologic procedures in the last few months, 
as well as Foley catheter placement during this hospitalization. 
His catheter was removed, his antibiotic therapy narrowed to 
vancomycin alone, and his fevers resolved. Several days later, 
lower-grade temperature returned (as high as 100.8). A repeat 
infectious and non-infectious work-up was again undertaken, 
which did not reveal a cause. Drug fever was felt to be a 
possibility, and vancomycin was stopped after seven days of 
total therapy. He promptly defervesced with this and had no 
further elevated temperatures prior to discharge. 
.
#RLE and knee swelling: This was first noted several days into 
the patient's hospitalization. It began with warmth and swelling 
of the patient's right knee. An x-ray was obtained demonstrating 
the presence of previously placed orthopedic hardware and 
degenerative changes. A RLE ultrasound was negative for clot. 
The right knee was tapped on ___ to differentiate between 
gout versus possible septic arthritis; the tap was consistent 
with gout. Over the next several days, the patient developed 
ascending edema of the RLE. A repeat ultrasound was again 
obtained, to evaluate both for thrombus or a possible 
compressive pelvic mass; neither of these were identified. In 
the last two days of hospitalization, the swelling appeared to 
improve mildly. Of note, the patient had been off his diuretics 
given his renal failure. If this swelling continues to persist, 
an abdominal CT scan should be considered, however this was not 
pursued prior to discharge given the patient's rapidly changing 
renal function.
.
#Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline SCr is thought to 
be approximately 1.3-1.4. At admission, his creatinine was 
mildly elevated at 1.6. His furosemide and ___ were held. His 
creatinine subsequently improved, however several days into his 
hospitalization he was noted to have an unexplained bump in both 
his SCr (peak 2.7) and his LFTs (predominantly a transaminitis, 
peak ALT 458, peak AST 867). The etiology of both these 
processes was unclear, however they appeared to be most 
consistent with an ischemic episode of some kind (of note, no 
hypotensive episodes, even mild hypotension, were ever 
documented). Cardiac biomarkers were cycled and an echo was 
obtained, both of which were non-revealing. The patient's renal 
function and LFTs improved (SCr back to 1.5). Later on his 
hospital course, his renal failure worsened again slightly; this 
was thought to be due to poor PO intake and responded to fluid 
administration.
.
#Transient rise in LFTs: Please see section on acute renal 
failure as above. This was thought to be related to transient 
hepatorenal ischemia, although the exact etiology was not 
completely clear.
.
#Poor PO intake/electrolyte abnormalities: The patient was felt 
to have poor PO intake throughout his stay, primarily related to 
his mental status. Without IV fluid support, he would trend 
towards a pre-renal, hypernatremic picture (serum Na 146 on day 
of discharge). The patient would respond well to feeding by 
family members and the nursing staff. It is hoped that with 
rehabilitation and further improvement in his mental status, his 
ability to take POs will improve.
.
#Aspiration: The patient is felt to aspirate his sections and 
oral intake frequently. He was empirically placed on a pureed 
and thickened diet, which seemed to improve this issue somewhat. 
His did not have a formal Speech and Swallow evaluation and it 
was thought unlikely this would change the nature of his care. 
He was not thought to have frank aspiration pneumonia at any 
point in his stay.
.
#Pruritus/rash: This was a chronic issue for the patient, 
beginning many months ago. Dermatology was consulted since the 
patient was itching his skin to the extent breakdown was 
occurring. Topical therapies, including triamcinolone as needed, 
were recommended and are included in the discharge medication 
list. 
.
#Conjunctivitis/corneal abrasion: The patient had seen his 
optometrist just prior to admission and was thought to have a 
left sided conjunctivitis. In the hospital, he was empirically 
treated with erythromycin ointment and tobramycin drops. His 
right eye was also bothering him, and ophthalmology was 
eventually consulted. The patient was found to have a right eye 
corneal abrasion, probably caused when the patient was 
scratching. An eye patch and keeping the eye lid closed were 
recommended; antibiotic drops were also initiated. The patient 
is scheduled for ophthalmology follow-up at ___ tomorrow, 
___.
.
#Hematuria/urothelial cell carcinoma: The patient had been 
previously known to have a bladder mass; this was diagnosed as a 
carcinoma by urine cytology shortly before admission. At 
admission, the patient was having significant hematuria. A Foley 
catheter was placed to allow for flushing of the bladder; his 
hematuria persisted, and he eventually required continuous 
irrigation for several days. In this setting, he required a 
total of three units pRBCs transfusion (two units, followed by 
an additional unit several days later). His hematuria improved 
significantly and all catheters were able to be discontinued 
within approximately the first week of his stay. The patient has 
planned urology follow-up for resection of the mass in the 
coming weeks.
.
#anemia: This was thought to be multifactorial in etiology 
(iron-deficiency, chronic blood loss, chronic disease). The 
patient's HCT ranged in the mid-20s for most of his stay, with 
one dip as low as 21 while he was having hematuria. This 
responded to RBC transfusion.  
.  
#Ischemic cardiomyopathy: The patient was felt to by dry to 
euvolemic during most of his admission, despite the holding of 
his furosemide (and ___ due to his ARF. He also tolerated the 
administration of several liters of fluid without any evidence 
of volume overload except, possible, his RLE swelling. An echo 
was checked and was unchanged. He was continued on his home beta 
blocker and ASA.
.  
#CAD: The patient's home ASA, beta blocker and statin were 
continued.
.  
#DM: The patient's home glipizide was held. He was managed with 
fixed dose/sliding scale insulin. 
.  
#HTN: As above, the patient's home beta blocker was continued 
but his ___ was held. He was mildly hypertensive during his stay 
but not to a degree that required intervention.
.

ECG ___:
Normal sinus rhythm. Tracing is within normal limits. No 
previous tracing available for comparison.  

Chest (PA & LAT) ___:
UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: The heart size is 
normal. The aorta is slightly unfolded. The mediastinal and 
hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. Within the medial 
aspect of the right lung base, there is a focal rounded opacity 
identified. The left lung is clear. No pneumothorax or pleural 
effusion is present. There are no acute osseous findings. 
  
IMPRESSION: Rounded opacity projecting over the medial right 
lung base, which could represent an area of inflammation or 
infection. However, the rounded morphology may be suggestive of 
an underlying mass lesion, and further evaluation with CT is 
recommended. 

CTA Chest ___:
CTA CHEST: The pulmonary arterial vasculature is normally 
opacified to the subsegmental level, without evidence of filling 
defect to suggest pulmonary embolism. The aorta is normal in 
size and caliber without acute aortic pathology. The remaining 
great mediastinal vessels are normal.  
  
In the right lower lobe, there is a large consolidative opacity, 
measuring approximately 8.6 x 6.8 cm in maximum cross-sectional 
dimension (image 3:87).  Pulmonary arterial branches normally 
traverse through the consolidation area, compatible with the ""CT 
angiogram sign"". There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. 
No other pulmonary nodule or mass is noted.  
  
The heart is normal in size without pericardial effusion. The 
central tracheobronchial tree is patent. There is no 
mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy. 
  
The study is not designed for subdiaphragmatic diagnosis. A 
subcentimeter hypodensity in the right hepatic lobe (image 
3:106) is too small to be fully characterized and a sub-cm 
hypodensity in the left lobe of the liver (3:100) is likely a 
cyst. The right adrenal is not visualized. The left adrenal is 
only partially imaged, but no abnormality is noted. 
  
BONE WINDOW: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions. 

  
IMPRESSION: 
1. No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology. 
2. Right lower lobe airspace consolidation, with demonstration 
of the ""CT angiogram"" sign. Differential diagnosis includes 
pneumonia, bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, and lymphoma. Recommend 
followup imaging after treatment to ensure clearance. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo female with DM I, osteopenia, recent L olecranon fracture 
fix 2 weeks ago presenting with SOB, fever, cough, and found to 
have RLL opacity on CXR  
.  
# Fever: Pt presented with fever, cough, SOB, and pain on deep 
inspiration consistent with pneumonia.  CXR and CTA chest 
revealed RLL opacity concerning for PNA.  (In setting of recent 
surgery of olecranon fracture, CTA chest was performed to rule 
out PE.)  However, given atypical appearance of consolidation, 
malignancy could not be ruled out.  Pt was advised to have 
repeat imaging upon resolution of pneumonia and was scheduled 
for outpatient CT chest.  She was started on oral levofloxacin 
for CAP.  Gram stain of sputum revealed 1+ gram positive cocci 
in pairs; culture grew sparse commensal respiratory flora.  
Urine legionella was negative.  Despite her recent hospital 
stay, she was not started on treatment for HCAP as she appeared 
nontoxic and improved significantly over 24 hours on 
levofloxacin.  She was discharged home with instructions to 
complete a 7 day course of levofloxacin.  
.  
# Left olecranon fracture: Pt reported having been at an OSH for 
two days for surgery for her left olecranon fracture two weeks 
prior to presentation to ___.  Left arm was kept in a sling.  
She reported no pain in the arm.  Incision was clean, dry, and 
intact.  
. 
# DM type I: Pt had humalog insulin pump which was continued 
during her hospital stay.  Per protocol, she was evaluated by 
the ___ diabetes team and seen by the nutritionist.  Per 
___ recs, she was continued on her home pump settings as 
blood glucose remained grossly within target range.  She was 
continued on her home aspirin.  
.  
# Depression: No acute issues.  She was continued on her home 
citalopram  
.  
# Osteopenia: Pt had history of multiple fractures, most 
recently a fracture of her left olecranon which was repaired two 
weeks prior to admission.  She was continued on her calcium and 
vitamin D.  She was also taking alendronate once a week which 
should be continued as outpatient.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ F w/ PMHx of HTN, HLD, PVD, COPD, history 
of rectal cancer, and anemia who presented from cardiology 
clinic with symptoms of dizziness in setting of new onset atrial 
fibrillation found to have over-repletion of thyroid hormone, 
hospital course complicated by acute pulmonary edema.  

# Acute Pulmonary Edema: Early on the morning of ___, the 
patient woke up acutely short of breath and hypertensive to 
systolics of 200. A chest x-ray showed worsened pulmonary edema 
in RLL. She was treated with 40mg IV Lasix and a nitroglycerin 
drip. She required BiPAP and was transferred to the CCU where 
she was treated with 3 additional doses of 40mg IV lasix over 
the course of 2 days. She only required BiPAP for 6 hours, and 
was then weaned to nasal cannula oxygen supplementation. 
Nitroglycerin drip was weaned off and home dose amlodipine was 
restarted. Review of the TTE showed 3+ MR ___ etiology thought 
to be possible flail mitral valve leaflet) as the presumed 
cauase for the patient's acute pulmonary edema. The patient 
continued to received IV furosemide on the floor with 
improvement in oxygen requirement with the patient on RA on the 
day of discharge. The patient was transitioned to PO torsemide 
___. The patient was started on losartan for after load 
reduction as well as metoprolol. Weight on day of discharge: 
47.7kg.

# Atrial fibrillation: CHADS-2 score of 2; patient has never had 
a stroke or TIA in the past. Patient was rate controlled on 
metoprolol XL 100mg and converted to sinus rhythm on the morning 
of ___. Thyroid function testing revealed over repletion which 
may have been the etiology for new afib. Levothyroxine dose was 
decreased to 112mcg daily (from 135mcg). TFTs should be repeated 
in 6 weeks for discharge from ___ on this new dose. 
Anticoagulation was discussed with the patient's outpatient 
providers (Cardiology and Primary care physician); given the 
patient's history of falls, the decision was made to use full 
strength aspirin for anticoagulation.  Patient's metoprolol was 
decreased to 50mg metoprolol XL in light of development of acute 
pulmonary edema. 

# Pyuria: Early during admission, patient had UA suggestive of 
UTI with 49 WBC and few bacteria. Urine culture with less than 
10,000 organisms. Patient received 3 days of ciprofloxacin.  

# MRSA cystitis: Patient had Foley catheter placed during 
admission while being digressed. The patient's UA was suggestive 
of UTI but patient without white count when debris noted in the 
Foley catheter. Foley was discontinued. Urine culture showed 
MRSA, and patient complained of symptoms of dysuria. 
Sensitivities showed that MRSA was sensitive to Bactrim DS BID;

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old pleasant lady who presents with history of 
worsening cough and shortness of breath on exersion as well as 
urinary frequency. The patient was previous prescribed 
levofloxacin and Z-pack prior to admission. However one day 
before admission her symptoms became worse prompting her to see 
her PCP who referred her to the ED. 

# UTI: Her admission labs were notable for a UA suggesting a UTI 
and an elevated Cr to 1.8. She was started on PO Cipro for a 
presumed UTI. First urine culture returned negative but pt still 
reported urinary sx so a second urine culture was sent and is 
pending at time of discharge. She completed a 5-day course of 
Cipro while in-house and her Cr improved with IV fluids. 
Discharge Cr was 1.1.   

# COPD exacerbation: pt's wheezing thought most likely to be 
COPD exacerbation. Her CXR excluded pneumonia, and her blood 
culture excluded sepsis. Since the patient recently finished a 
course of azithromycin prior to admission she was only started 
on a prednisone taper. She was discharged on a prolonged taper 
as discussed with her outpatient pulmonologist Dr. ___. 

# constipation: pt was put on bowel regimen including 
senna/Colace, lactulose, psyllium when she reported she had not 
had ostomy output for 5 days. She typically has ostomy output 
every 3 days. She will continue on senna/Colace in the 
outpatient setting. 

# urinary retention: pt was found to have persistently have high 
post-void residuals and required straight cathing. This was 
thought to be a chronic issue based on her history of UTIs and 
pyuria. She should be bladder scanned in rehab and will follow 
up with urology in the outpatient setting to discuss further 
workup. 

CHRONIC ISSUES: 

# anemia: hemoglobin trended down mildly but remained close to 
pt's baseline. Anemia is believed to be a combination of iron 
deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease. She received a 
unit of pRBCs for a  Hgb of 7.3, but should follow up with her 
primary care doctor about reinitiating EPO. 

# diastolic CHF: the most recent echo in ___ showed EF >55% 
and LVH with moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation. The 
pt did not have s/s of CHF exacerbation in house. She was 
restarted on her torsemide at a reduced dose of 10 mg twice 
weekly. 

# anxiety: pt was discontinued from lorazepam and did not 
require treatment for anxiety

# HLD: continued home pravastatin 

# HTN: continued home metoprolol 

# hypothyroidism: continued home SYnthroid. TSH here was 3.2. 

# ostomy care: wound consult was placed for concern for sores 
around the ostomy site. The pt reports that in the past she has 
received chromalin spray that was helpful for addressing the 
sores. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUE:
=========================
- steroid taper: prednisone 40 mg for a total of 5 days then 
transition to prednisone 20 mg for another 5 days. Pt should 
continue on 30mg/day for 3 days, 20mg/day for 3 days, then 
10mg/day for 3 days, then 5mg/day for 3 days and follow up with 
Dr. ___. 
- Torsemide dose on discharge: 10 mg. Pt should take torsemide 
twice weekly as needed. 
- urine culture: pt has urine culture from ___ pending at time 
of discharge. Please follow this up. 
- urinary retention: pt found to have persistently elevated 
post-void residuals and required straight cathing. She seems to 
have h/o chronic urinary retention. She should follow up with 
urology for question of cystoscopy. She should get bladder scans 
TID and be straight cathed for PVR >500 at rehab. 
- EPO injections: pt found to have anemia of chronic disease and 
started on iron, B12 and folate supplements. Per discussion with 
pt, she should follow up with PCP to discuss whether to continue 
EPO injections for her anemia (she hasn't received any in about 
___ years). She did receive 1 U pRBCs while inpatient. 
- medication changes: consider discontinuing donepezil as pt 
does not appear to have dementia as she has relatively high 
functional status (able to use phone, engage appropriately in 
conversation etc). Pt's lorazepam was d/c'ed as she did not 
require it in house.

Imaging:
========
___ CXR:
Mild cardiomegaly, as seen previously, with mild pulmonary 
vascular 
congestion, but no frank pulmonary edema.  Small bilateral 
pleural effusions with patchy bibasilar opacities, potentially 
atelectasis, but infection or aspiration is not excluded in the 
correct clinical setting.

___ CT Head:
1. No acute intracranial abnormalities. 
2. Global parenchymal volume loss and sequela of chronic small 
vessel ischemic disease.

___ TTE:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Diastolic function could 
not be assessed. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, 
ascending and arch levels are normal. The number of aortic valve 
leaflets cannot be determined. There is no aortic valve 
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the 
eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be 
significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). Moderate to severe 
[3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least 
moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to 
a very high right atrial pressure.] There is no pericardial 
effusion. 

IMPRESSION: 
1) Normal biventricular regional/global systolic function.
2) At least moderate mitral regurgitation (difficult to assess 
due to Coanda effect) due to possibly partial anterior mitral 
valve leaflet flail.
3) Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation with normal RV 
size/function in setting of at least mild elevation of RV 
afterload.

___ CXR:
Small left pleural effusion has increased.  Increased left 
basilar opacity, may represent atelectasis or developing 
pneumonia.

___ KUB:
IMPRESSION: 
1. No abnormally dilated loops of small or large bowel to 
suggest obstruction. 
2. Enteric tube terminates in stable position in the expected 
position of the stomach body.

valvular heart disease (3+ MR/2+TR per ___ TTE), and atrial 
fibrillation, remote h/o colorectal cancer s/p ostomy, and 
suprapubic catheter, who presented with malaise x 4 days, 
hyponatremia, and new onset cough and dyspnea, thought to be 
secondary to pulmonary edema as well as pneumonia. Hospital 
course complicated by epigastric pain/ileus thought to be 
secondary to initiation of diltiazem, which improved, and new 
pneumonia noted on CXR prior to discharge.

# Dyspnea:
# Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: presented with worsening 
dyspnea. Also endorsed orthopnea, and BNP > 11,000 (previously 
1800 one year ago). CXR with mild opacities, possible 
atelectasis vs. aspiration vs. infection as well as pulmonary 
vascular congestion. TTE did not reveal any new systolic 
dysfunction. Overall her dyspnea was thought to be secondary to 
mild fluid overload, aspiration, and possibly URI/mild 
pneumonia. She was initially treated broadly with vanc and 
levofloxacin 750 mg PO Q48H. Vancomycin was discontinued given 
negative MRSA swab and she completed a 5 day course of 
levofloxacin finishing on ___. She was diuresed with IV Lasix 
boluses 20mg BID until she developed an increase in her 
creatinine. Home torsemide was re-intiated at same dose as 
prior, and patient appeared euvolemic at time of discharge. 2 
days prior to discharge, new area of likely pneumonia seen on 
CXR. Patient without fever, and good O2 sat on RA. Started 
ceftriaxone, transitioned to cefpodoxime for total ___nding ___ (see transitional issues below).
- Discharge Cr: 0.9
- Discharge weight: 39.3 kg (bed weight, may not be accurate)

# Fever: 100.7 on ___. CXR revealed likely atelectasis but 
could not rule out infection. Blood cultures were sent and were 
no growth at time of discharge. She had a grossly positive UA, 
expected given suprapubic catheter. Urine culture with no growth 
and no GU symptoms at time of discharge.

# Epigastric pain / Illeus: Patient developed significant 
abdominal pain and distension requiring NG tube placement 4 days 
prior to discharge, with improvement in symptoms after 
suctioning. Thought to be secondary to initiation of diltiazem, 
and diltiazem was d/c'ed and metoprolol reinitiated (see below). 
Epigastric pain improved and patient was drinking adequately, 
and drinking small amounts prior to discharge.

# Atrial fibrillation: RVR on arrival, improved with diltiazem 
IV and then PO diltiazem. The timing of diltiazem initiation 
coincided with GI symptoms (per above) and so this was stopped, 
and metoprolol was restarted at a higher dose with good effect, 
and HR was in the ___ to low 100s. She had recently been started 
on digoxin at urgent care. This was initially stopped but then 
restarted due to difficulty controlling rates during 
hospitalization.

# Hyponatremia: presented with serum Na of 118. Urine Na was 116 
prior to Lasix, likely SIADH. Patient reports recently 
increasing her free water intake which may explain acute onset. 
Na normalized with free water restriction.
 
# Chest pain: troponins negative x 4, poor historian. EKG was 
without ischemic changes. Likely musculoskeletal/epigastric 
pain.

# COPD: Gold stage II on chronic azithromycin. No wheezing on 
exam without evidence of active COPD exacerbation. Continued 
home tiotropium bromide 1 cap daily, ipratroprium-albuterol neb 
Q6H, and albuterol nebs prn. Home symbicort was non formulary 
and she was treated with inhaled fluticasone. 

# Ostomy: patient with peristomal raised lesions. Seen by 
colorectal surgery who recommended dermatology consult to rule 
out malignancy. They felt that this was not urgent andcould be 
done as outpatient. ___ require treatment with steroids

Transitional Issues:
====================
- INCREASED metoprolol succinate to 100mg in setting of afib w 
RVR. Initially changed to diltiazem but d/c'ed diltiazem due to 
abd symptoms (see above) 
- STARTED digoxin 0.25mg
- Patient noted to aspirate on speech and swallow evaluation. 
Should take only thickened liquids
- Please check video swallow once patient fully stable as 
outpatient, per recommendation of speech and swallow
- Discharged on 1.5L fluid restriction - hyponatremic on 
admission with Na of 118. Urine lytes consistent with SIADH. 
- CONTINUE home dose of torsemide 
- Please coordinate non-urgent dermatology evaluation for 
periostomal ulcers, may need steroid treatment
- RECHECK TSH as an outpatient. Borderline low on admission at 
0.32, consider decreasing dose of levothyroxine as outpatient 
given RVR on presentation (although more likely secondary to 
volume overload)
- STARTED cefpodoxime day for 5 days (first day ___, last day 
___
- HELD azithromycin (chronic UTI suppression) given on 
cefpodoxime and given its interaction with donepezil. Consider 
restarting. Please check EKG prior for QTc monitoring

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking part in your care while you were in the 
hospital. You were admitted because you were feeling short of 
breath. You were found to have a low sodium level, but this 
rapidly improved. You were given IV medication to remove fluid 
from around the lungs. You were also given antibiotics for a 
mild pneumonia. During the hospitalization, your heart rates 
increased, requiring adjustment of your medications as listed 
below. Your metoprolol dose was increased, and a drug, digoxin, 
was started. You also were noted to have abdominal pain and 
distension, and a nasogastric tube was placed to decompress your 
stomach, and improved your discomfort. At that time, a 
medication, diltiazem was stopped, as it was thought to be 
contributing to your stomach discomfort.

You likely developed a new mild pneumonia, and were treated 
first with and IV antibiotic, and one to take by mouth at the 
rehab. Your breathing was good without the need for additional 
oxygen at the time of your discharge from the hospital. Your 
abdominal discomfort improved as well.

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO AFTER LEAVING THE HOSPITAL:
1. Do not drink more than 1.5 liters of fluid a day
2. Drink only thickened liquids

Again, it has been a pleasure taking part in your care, and we 
wish you the best.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure treating you for flu and pneumonia. When you 
arrived at ___, you tested positive for the flu which was 
causing a fever as well as some confusion and tiredness. Your 
initial chest x-ray showed improvement of your prior pneumonia. 
While being treated for the flu and dehydration with Tamiflu and 
IV fluids, you developed a new pneumonia that was seen on a 
second chest x-ray and required antibiotics and fluids. Due to 
decreased oral intake of food and beverage, you developed 
elevated levels of sodium in your blood, which improved after 
you were given IV fluids.

Please weigh yourself every morning, and call your doctor if 
your weight goes up more than 3 lbs. Please continue to take all 
your regular medications, and follow up at any appointments that 
are scheduled. 

Again, it has been a pleasure taking part in your care, and we 
wish you the best.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ right-handed man with history
notable for apical variant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, HTN c/b
CKD, pituitary microadenoma c/b hyperprolactinemia, and
hypothyroidism presenting with a transient episode of 
right-sided
sensory disturbance and lightheadedness.

Mr. ___ reports being in his usual state of health this
morning as he was driving to work; on turning the corner just
after pulling out from his house, around 07:20, he noted acute
onset of lightheadedness (without vertigo or disequilibrium) as
well as right-sided sensory disturbance. He reports having
previously had similar episodes of lightheadedness for which he
was evaluated by Cardiology, who noted minimal atrial and
ventricular ectopy on cardiac monitoring, and advised Mr. 
___
that he would likely need further cardiac monitoring if his
symptoms recurred to evaluate for an occult arrhythmia. However,
he denies a similar prior history of sensory disturbance, which
he describes today as initial ""tingling"" paresthesiae of the
entire left arm and much of the left leg (sparing the ankles and
feet) replaced by mild numbness when rubbing his arm with his
left hand for the next ___ minutes. He denies associated
headache, neck pain, photo- or phonophobia, nausea, vomiting, or
a radicular or radiating pattern to his sensory symptoms, and 
has
not had recurrent symptoms since initial onset. He discussed
these symptoms with his son, who is an internal medicine
resident, who recommended presentation to the ED for further
evaluation.

On review of systems, aside from the above, Mr. ___ denies
recent headache, vertigo, speech disturbance, vision change,
diplopia, hearing change, dysarthria, dysphagia, focal weakness,
paresthesiae, bowel or bladder incontinence, gait disturbance,
nausea, vomiting, chest discomfort, palpitations, abdominal 
pain,
changes in bowel or bladder habits, myalgias, arthralgias, or 
new
rash.

Brief Hospital Course:
PATIENT SUMMARY:
================
Mr. ___ is a ___ right-handed man with history 
notable for apical variant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, HTN c/b 
CKD, pituitary microadenoma c/b hyperprolactinemia, and 
hypothyroidism presenting with a transient episode of 
right-sided sensory disturbance and lightheadedness.

NCHCT negative for acute stroke. MR with very small punctate 
subacute infarct in the left centrum semiovale. A stroke in this 
area explains his right sided sensory changes. Exam is normal. 
Etiology is likely small vessel disease
vs cardioembolic. 

Before MR imaging was finalized, seizure was on the differential 
for his transient symptoms, thus EEG was performed. Final read 
pending at time of discharge.

Risk factor labs notable for A1c 5.1%, TSH 3.9, LDL 46. Given 
LDL < 70, no indication to increase statin dose at the present 
time.

He was started on Aspirin 81 mg daily.

Given cardiac history and possible cardioembolic etiology, TTE 
was obtained. This showed apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
without left ventricular or atrial mass (cardiac MRI would be 
more sensitive for focal apical thrombus, TEE for left atrial 
appendage thrombus). Mild mitral regurgitation. 

Ziopatch was placed for extended cardiac monitoring to assess 
for occult atrial fibrillation.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
- Continue aspirin 81mg for stroke prevention

- Ziopatch in place. Follow up read.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr ___,  

 You were hospitalized due to symptoms of right sided sensory 
changes resulting from a TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK, a condition 
where a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain 
is blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your body that 
controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage 
to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result 
in a variety of symptoms.  

 Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
 - High blood pressure  
 - High cholesterol

 We are changing your medications as follows:  
 - Please start Aspirin 81mg daily to help prevent future 
strokes 

 Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
 Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  
 
 If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
 - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
 - Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
 - Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
 - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  
 
Sincerely,  
Your ___ Neurology Team

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Liver biopsy

 
History of Present Illness:
HPI: Pt is a ___ G2P1 at 26w2d who is admitted to the 
___
service with elevated LFTs. She reports a two-day history of
diffuse pruritus and jaundice. Pruritus was so severe that she
was unable to sleep. She found no relief from Benadryl, Tylenol
___, oatmeal baths, or topical hydrocortisone cream. She could 
not
find a rash, and when she had her mother search her skin, her
mother first noticed scleral icterus. She denies any history of
liver disease, or any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fevers,
chills, or myalgias. She denies any change in color of her
stools, hematochezia, or melena, but does note that her urine is
now the color of ___. She has never had symptoms like this
before, although she does give a history of mildly elevated 
LFTs,
maybe ___ years ago, which on recheck were reportedly normal last
year.

She has a history of poly-substance abuse, including IV drug 
use,
although she acknowledges only a single use of IV heroin. She
does acknowledge other heroin use, intranasally, twice
previously. She denies any history of intranasal cocaine use. 
She
has previously abused narcotic pain medications, but has been on
methadone for the last six months since she has known about her
pregnancy, and has not used any drugs including tobacco, EtOH,
and narcotics. She denies any tattoos or piercinges (apart from
her earlobes bilaterally), and no history of blood transfusions.
She has not been sexually active recently as her husband has 
been
away from home, travelling to ___ for business. She denies any
herbs, supplements, or OTC medications apart from Tylenol ___ and
Benadryl. Regarding the Tylenol ___, she states that she took two
tablets two days ago without any relief, and took two tablets
yesterday prior to coming to the ED. She does note using an
oatmeal-based bath for her pruritus that she purchased from a
nutritional supplement store. She also acknowledges having eaten
out a number of times during her pregnancy, especially in recent
weeks during the ___. These include sushi ___ roll,
denies any uncooked fish), cold cuts (including ___, ham, and
___ cheese), fruit salad from an outdoor fair, and others. She
also does acknowledge prior hypertension during this pregnancy,
about one month ago, when she was advised to ""keep an eye on 
it"",
so she has been checking herself at ___. She notes that her 
worst
BPs have been as high as 190/90.

She did have some vomiting and diarrhea this morning, which she
attributes to withdrawing from her methadone as she did not
receive this morning's dose at the usual time of her home
schedule, and since receiving it these symptoms have resolved.

She was reportedly seen first at an OSH ED prior to transfer to 
our ED
given her elevated LFTs, but these records were reportedly ""lost
on the way"" and are unavailable for review currently.

___ LIVER US
1. Normal liver echogenicity. No biliary duct dilatation. 
2. Limited Doppler due to breathing motion; however, normal flow 
is seen in main, left, and right portal vein, and main hepatic 
artery. Wall-to- wall flow in the hepatic veins. 
3. Unremarkable gallbladder with no evidence of cholelithiasis 
or 
cholecystitis. 

___ Liver, needle core biopsy:

1.  Marked portal and moderate periportal and lobular mixed 
inflammation with lobular disarray and numerous apoptotic 
hepatocytes.
2.  Moderate intrahepatic and canalicular cholestasis.
3.  No significant steatosis or ballooning degeneration are 
seen.
4.  Trichrome stain shows minimally increased portal fibrosis.
5.  Iron stain shows no stainable iron.
6.  Reticulin stain does not demonstrate significant hepatic 
parenchymal necrosis or collapse.
7.  Immunohistochemical stains for cytomegalovirus and herpes 
simplex viruses are pending and will be reported in an addendum.

Note: The features are compatible with a moderately active 
hepatitis with mixed inflammation, lobular disarray, feathery 
degeneration of hepatocytes, and moderate cholestasis.  The 
differential diagnosis includes an acute hepatitis of viral or 
drug-induced etiology.  Given the patient's negative autoimmune 
serologies and lack of prominent lobular plasmacytic component, 
an acute presentation of autoimmune hepatitis is less likely. 

ADDENDUM: 
Immunostains for cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex viruses I 
and II are negative with satisfactory controls.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the antepartum service from ___ 
to ___ for transaminitis, jaundice, pruritus with 
coagulopathy. A hepatology consultation was obtained. A liver 
ultrasound with dopplers showed no evidence of fibrosis or other 
abnormalities. The hepatology team was significantly impressed 
by the extent of liver injury and requested a biopsy of the 
liver. Pathology was consistent with acute hepatitis. 
Viral antibody studies were sent and these were signficant for a 
positive hepatitis C antibody. Her viral load was 54,700 copies. 
Patient was counseled about this new diagnosis and questions 
were answered. 
.
Her transamnitis began to resolves spontaneously and her INR 
normalized. Her only complaint of pruritis was managed with 
pepcid, atarax and actigall.
.
Fetal testing was reassuring. EFW ___ was 1038g, 58.5 percentile 
(___).
Patient had labs pending at discharge including bile salts, HEP 
C viral RNA genotype and soluble liver antibodies. 
.
___ need follow-up with Hepatology after discharge. She 
opted to see a specialist closer to her rather than following up 
with the ___ here. She will need assistance with the 
referral. She will need monthly LFTs and viral load every 3 
months. She will also need to discuss treatment options after 
postpartum.  She is aware that this will have to be set-up by 
her primary physicians.  Please help her coordinate this.

Hepatitis C who presents from ___ after being
evaluated for shortness of breath of two days duration. Patient
was initially seen and evaluated by her PCP on ___ and
prescribed inhalers with little relief. On ___, her
shortness of breath worsened and she was seen by her OB today in
the office who sent her to ___ for further
evaluation and rule out pre-eclampsia.

In the ED, the patient received Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV x 1, an
albuterol nebulizer and Ceftriaxone 1g IV x 1. The patient was
afebrile and her WBC was 9. Troponin and BNP were negative. The
patient had a CTA which per report was negative. A CXR was
significant for a mild hazy opacity throughout the lungs which
was most pronounced at the lung bases and perihilar region. This
was concerning for interstitial infiltrates. Her Echo was normal
with an EF of 65%. there were no wall motion abnormalities.
Borderline right atrial enlargement and a suspected patent
foramen ovale.

Ms. ___ was transferred to ___ given concern for

pseudomonas. He remained febrile post op and his pre-op 
antibiotic regimen was changed from vancomycin-gentamycin to 
vancomycin and cefepime. He subsquently had the prosthesis fully 
removed on ___ and defervesced. His antibiotic regimen was 
narrowed to cefepime. PICC line was placed, and he was 
discharged with plans for ___ week course IV Cefepime. 
 
On ___, patient represented to the ED with ___ days groin and 
testicular pain. CT showed gas formation in peineal area. He was 
taken emergently to the OR on ___ for exploration of perineum 
with no evidence of active infection intraoperatively. He was 
initially covered with vancomycin and meropenem, then was 
transitioned back to cefepime with addition of metronidazole for 
anaerobic coverage on ___. Planned for ___ week course.  

On ___, patient was transitioned to PO cipro/flagyl. PICC 
was pulled. Antibiotics were stopped on ___ in the setting of 
possible antibiotic-associated diarrhea and improvement in exam. 
Diarrhea resolved.  

Over the past week, patient has had worsening R groin and 
perineal pain. He has needed to take oxycodone at night due to 
pain after weaning himself off one week prior. Pain worse 
movement, making walking difficult. Minimal increase in scrotal 
erythema. 2x packing areas changed daily, no issues with that. 
Endorses increased fatigue, denies fevers/chills, N/V/D. Saw PMD 
earlier this week, had CBC which showed WBC 20k. Of note, pt 
recently decreased hyydroxyurea for polycythemia.  

In the ED initial vitals were: 4 98.7 66 113/74 18 100% RA. Labs 
were significant for WBC 19 (86N, 0 band, 8L), H/H 13.9/39.1, 
plt 767. Cr 0.7. UA 23 WBC (chronic condom cath). CT Pel showed 
subcutaneous stranding and skin thickening in perineum and 
inferior medial gluteal regions and scrotum. Small collection of 
sub-q gas in L medal gluteal region substantially decreased from 
previous exam, may reflect packing material. No fluid 
collections.  
Urology was consulted, who did not feel there was an operative 
issue. Advised gen surg consult (they were involved in prior 
debridement), IV antibiotics, ID consult. General surgery agreed 
there was no indication for further I &D. Patient was given 
oxycodone, docusate, metronidazole, cefepime. Vitals prior to 
transfer were: 2 98.3 57 127/69 16 99% RA.  

On the floor, patient reports ongoing perineal pain R > L and 
posterior scrotal pain.

IMAGING:  
___  
CT Abd/Pel w Contrast  
1. Subcutaneous stranding and skin thickening involving the 
perineum and inferior medial gluteal regions as well as scrotum. 
Small collection of subcutaneous gas in the left medial gluteal 
region is substantially decreased from the previous exam, and 
may reflect packing material. No fluid collections.  
2. Bilateral hydroceles are improved.  
3. Reactive right inguinal lymphadenopathy.  

___
MRI pelvis w and wo contrast:
1. Edema and enhancement throughout the right adductor 
musculature and right aspect of the pelvic floor/perineum, may 
reflect a nonspecific myositis and may be 
infectious/inflammatory in nature although recent trauma could 
result in a similar imaging appearance; clinical correlation is 
recommended. Although adjacent edema within the right inferior 
pubic ramus potentially could be due to osteomyelitis, the 
absence of associated cortical erosion argues against this.  The 
changes are asymmetric and likely somewhat remote from a 
radiation field. 
2. Moderate subcutaneous edema along the right inguinal region, 
extending along the anteroinferior aspect of the pelvis, 
nonspecific in nature. Clinical correlation with evidence of 
cellulitis is recommended. 
3. Unchanged right inguinal lymphadenopathy, presumably 
reactive. 

___ 
L spine pelvis w and wo contrast:
1. No evidence of osteomyelitis or epidural abscess within the 
lumbar spine. 
2. Multilevel multifactorial degenerative changes throughout the 
lumbar spine, as described above. 

___
CT pelvis w/o contrast:
1. Indistinctness of the inferomedial cortex along the anterior 
aspect of the right inferior pubic ramus, corresponding to the 
area of marrow edema on the recent pelvis MRI, indeterminate in 
nature.  The possibly of osteomyelitis cannot be conclusively 
excluded.  No fracture line identified. 
2. Circumferential bladder wall thickening may be related to 
bladder's decompressed state; clinical correlation is 
recommended to exclude cystitis. 
3. Right inguinal lymphadenopathy, similar to the prior MRI from 
___. 

___
CXR line placement:
New left-sided PICC line ends in the low SVC. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ gentleman with a history of prostate 
cancer JAK2 positive essential thrombocythemia and prostate 
cancer s/p radical prostatectomy in ___ c/b erectile 
dysfunction. He underwent penile prosthesis in ___ and has had 
a complicated course with multiple prosthesis infections. He 
presents with worsening R groin/perineal pain and leukocytosis 
in the setting of recent antibiotic cessation.

# Osteomyelitis / groin soft tissue infection:
He had perineal pain and leukocytosis concerning for recurrent 
infection in the setting of multiple previous infections after 
radical prostatectomy and penile implant. No abscess or fluid 
collection seen on CT. He was evaluated by urology and general 
surgery who determined no acute surgical intervention was 
needed. He was followed by wound care for management of his 
surgical dressings. MRI and CT showed concern for osteomyeltis 
of the pubic ramus vs small fracture. A bone biopsy was 
considered but deferred given the technical difficulty of the 
procedure and risk for complications. He had PICC placement with 
plan for vancomycin/cefepime/Flagyl for a total 6 week course 
for presumptive osteomyelitis.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Essential Thrombocytosis: 
His platelet count was near baseline. There was suspicion for 
additional marrow dysplasia given increase in all 3 hematogenous 
cell lines during admission. He was titrated back to his 
previous home dose of 1000 mg hydroxyurea alternating with 
1500mg daily per ___ hematology recommendations.

# Thrombosed External Hemorrhoid:
Previously on steroid creams. He was given Hydrocortisone 
(Rectal) BID during admission.

# Depression: Continued citalopram  

# Constipation: Received Senna / Colace as needed.

TRANSITION ISSUES:
- His hydroxyurea for essential thrombocytosis was restored to 
daily alternating doses of 1gm / 1.5 gm.
- He will need to complete a 6 week course of 
vancomycin/cefepime/flagyl for presumptive osteomyelitis (last 
day of therapy ___.

## Additional Transitional Issues per Previous Urology Notes:
- Pelvic floor ___ to address incontinence  
- When scrotal incision closed, d/c condom cath  
- Consider re-implant of prosthesis after 6 months and urinary 
issues resolved

IMAGING:  
___ MRI Prostate:  
There is persistent edema and enhancement throughout the 
inferomedial right pubic ramus and surrounding adductor 
musculature, which is slightly improved from ___. The 
absence of cortical destruction limits the conclusion of 
osteomyelitis, however, this cannot be excluded. No abscess.  

___ CT Abd & Pelvis With Contrast: 
1. No retroperitoneal hematoma. 
2. Increased sclerosis of the inferior right pubic ramus 
reflects the underlying chronic inflammatory process. No 
definite evidence for acute osteomyelitis. For additional 
details, please see the recent prostate MRI. 
3. Unchanged, mild splenomegaly. 
 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with h/o prostate cancer, penile prosthesis c/b infection 
and pubic ramus osteomyelitis s/p prolonged antibiotic course 
presenting with progressive right hip pain since discontinuation 
of antibiotics.  

# Osteomyelitis / groin soft tissue infection: Pt with worsening 
pain and rising inflammatory markers (CRP 11.6 to 81 in last 10 
days) since discontinuing vanc/cefepime/metronidazole, 
suggesting antibiotic failure. No abscess on imaging. Ortho 
initially consulted but would defer open biopsy but do not see 
any need for debridement based on scans and defered to ___. S/P 
CT guided ___ biopsy of pubic ramus bone and surrounding tissue 
on ___. Culture growing pseudomonas sensitive to cefepime. Per 
ID recs will start vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl for at least 6 
weeks and they will decide final course as outpatient. Will 
likely narrow treatment once culture final. An appointment was 
made for the pt to see urologist to monitor site of surgical 
prosthesis removal and assess for any nidus of recurrent 
infection.
 
# Anemia: Hct drop 29.3-> 24 since outpatient labs drawn ___. 
Anemia with macrocytosis may represent side effect of 
hydroxyurea. No evidence of bleeding on prelim read of CT 
abd/pelvis, stool guaiac neg. Schistocytes on automated smear 
concerning for hemolysis. However, hapto, LDH, and Tbili 
negative for hemolysis. Retic index 1.9%. H/H was elevated in 
___ but currently similar to ___ and prior H/H. ___ 
heme/onc followed the patient and we were in touch with 
outpatient ___ hematologist. Held hydrea given anemia due to 
infection. Will consider restarting as outpatient. Will have 
weekly labs sent to ___ clinic which will be entered in OMR and 
hematologist will follow them up.  s/p transfusion ___ for HCT 
21 and given patient will be discharged with H/H unlikely to 
improve for quite some time due to sepsis and recent hydrea

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure to take care of you at ___. You were 
admitted with groin and thigh pain concerning for recurrence of 
an infection in your bone called osteomyelitis. You were seen by 
the infectious disease team who recommended a biopsy of the 
infected area. Interventional radiology performed a biopsy of 
the pubic ramus bone. The preliminary culture of the bone and 
surrounding area grew pseudomonas, which is the same bacteria as 
your last culture. You were started on 3 antibiotics and your 
course will be determined by your infectious disease providers 
as an outpatient. We made a follow up with urology this week to 
examine your prior surgery site in order to evaluate for a 
persistent source of this infection. You are being sent home 
with tramadol for your pain. While taking tramadol you should 
take colace, senna, and miralax every day to prevent 
constipation and lactulose as needed if you do become 
constipated. You can skip these medications on days that you 
have loose stool.

We wish you the best!

Sincerely,
Your ___ medical team

1. No evidence of colitis, pancreatitis, our other acute 
intra-abdominal 
process. 
2. Chronic findings, including one liver and multiple renal 
hypodensities, too small for further characterization. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ year old M with PMH of CAD s/p 4V CABG 
and asthma and recent admission for colitis who presented with 4 
weeks of epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting.

Active Issues: 

# Abdominal Pain
Patient has past admission to ___ in ___ for similar symptoms, 
and workup was unrevealing. Given his history of colitis, 
gastritis and PUD were suspected. Infectious etiologies such as 
gastroenteritis were deemed less likely as he had been 
symptomatic for 4 weeks and had no risk factors such as travel, 
camping, or new foods. His lipase and LFTs were normal, so 
pancreatitis, hepatitis, or biliary pathology were thought to be 
unlikely. In addition, his abdominal CT was unrevealing. 
Finally, 2 serial troponins were <.01, and there was isolated T 
wave inversion in V2, so cardiac etiology not likely. He had no 
electrolyte abnormalities or weight loss, so he had been able to 
maintain adequate nutritional intake as an outpatient. He 
reported no known history of peptic ulcers, and H. pylori IgG 
was negative. He received Maalox, diphenhydramine, and lidocaine 
as well as Tylenol PRN pain, which helped alleviate his 
symptoms. He was continued on omperazole 40mg BID and placed on 
a full liquid diet, which he was able to advance slowly, with 
LUQ pain after eating but no vomiting.

# Chronic right upper extremity pain
This pain was thought to be neurogenic as patient laid on that 
arm for hours during his ___ suicide attempt. He had been 
asking his PCP to take him off of narcotics and agreed to 
transition to gabapentin. His hydrocodone-acetaminophen was 
discontinued and he was started on gabapentin 100mg TID, to be 
uptitrated as an outpatient.  

Chronic Issues:

# Coronary Artery Disease
s/p 4v CABG in ___. His EKG was unconcerning and there was no 
rise is serial troponin levels x 2. He continued on ASA 81mg 
daily and metoprolol 100mg BID. He had said upon admission that 
he was worried about taking ASA because he thought it might harm 
his stomach, but was reassured that he should stay on this 
medication.  

# Asthma
He had wheezing in the ED, but resolved after nebs--his wheezing 
was present once he arrived on the floor, for which he received 
albuterol nebs.  

# Depression/Anxiety
History of suicide attempt in ___. No SI. He was continued on 
sertraline, trazodone, and clonazepam BID PRN. He reported being 
in a depressed mood.  

Transitional Issues:

# Follow up on H Pylori serology (lab result pending at 
discharge). 
# Consider food allergy testing, although he did not report 
symptoms with one specific food.
# Consider GI referral as an outpatient, as he has had similar 
symptoms in the past, including an admission in ___, 
without clear cause. 
# Patient wanted to stop Vicodin. He was started instead on 
low-dose gabapentin for right arm pain. Please ___ 
response as an outpatient, consider uptitration. 
# Unclear why patient not on aspirin with history of coronary 
artery disease. Consider starting if indicated.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___.

You were admitted for abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. You 
received medications to help with these symptoms. Meanwhile, 
your blood tests and vital signs (like blood pressure) showed 
that you have been receiving adequate amounts of fluids and 
nutrition through the foods and liquids you drink. You had a CT 
scan which showed no cause for your symptoms. In addition, we 
were reassured that you were able to eat lunch without any 
problems. Therefore, it is safe for you to return home and you 
can complete other tests or procedures as an outpatient.  

It is likely that your pain is from inflammation in the stomach, 
called gastritis. This can be treated with medications you are 
on (omeprazole). Your symptoms could also be from ulcers in the

which was concerning for colitis and he received 6 days of 
cipro/flagyl. Now reporting coffee ground colored stools, not 
currently taking pepto-bismol. No evidence of colitis, 
pancreaitis, or diverticulitis. Given NSAID use, prior PUD, 
post-prandial pain, and epigastric location peptic ulcer disease 
is most likely etiology, but could also represent NSAID 
gastritis. Patient felt maalox made him feel worse. Stopped 
cipro/flagyl on admission since no evidence of colitis; diarrhea 
improved. tTG negative. Treated here with IV PPI initially, 
transitioned back to home PO. Added sucralfate. Tolerated normal 
diet.  he did not provide sample for h. pylori serology.

characterized by coughing. Rather, the patient becomes acutely 
short of breath unrelated to any obvious aggravating factor; he 
provides nebs and Maalox and tries to calm her down, and she 
seems to slowly improve over one hour. Of note, the son does

nausea during the last week and on day of presentation which 
patient states is new. She presented to ___ yesterday 
for this problem; she had an unremarkable EKG by report. Per 
___, the son, they are seeing an outpatient GI specialist as 
well, and she had a CT scan done which showed patency of the 
esophagus and no obstruction that could be causing these 
episodes. H. Pylori negative. There is an outpatient endoscopy 
pending by Dr. ___ at ___ to further evaluate the 
problem that has not yet occurred. However, her son describes 
being concerned about her breathing, and worrying that he does 
not know what to do for her and wanted to rule out cardiac 
causes as well.

=====================
___ CXR
FINDINGS:  
Patient's chin obscures visualization of the lung apices.  There 
is no 
visualized consolidation, effusion, or edema.  The 
cardiomediastinal 
silhouette is stable.  Tortuosity of the thoracic aorta is again 
noted.  
Chronic deformity of the proximal left humerus suggests remote 
prior fracture. 
Old healed anterior right rib fractures are also noted.  No 
acute osseous 
abnormalities. 
  
IMPRESSION:   
No acute cardiopulmonary process. 

___ CXR
FINDINGS:  
Lung volume is low.  No consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural 
effusion is identified.  Mildly enlarged cardiomediastinal 
silhouette is unchanged.  Left humeral deformity is unchanged 
and is likely sequela of old fracture. 
  
IMPRESSION:    
No radiographic evidence of pneumonia. 

___ Video Oropharyngeal swallow study
FINDINGS:  
The study was limited due to the patient's body habitus and 
inability to relax shoulders.  Barium passes freely through the 
oropharynx without evident aspiration.  There was significant 
esophageal retention, which did not resolve with further 
swallowing attempts. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
Significant esophageal retention of barium.  This is likely 
related to severe esophageal dysmotility, if further evaluation 
is desired, a full esophogram can be performed. 
  
___ EGD
Findings:
 
Esophagus:  

 Lumen: A medium size hiatal hernia was seen.  

 Other presbyesophagus throughout the esophagus   

Stomach:  

Mucosa: Diffuse atrophic appearing mucosa of the mucosa with no 
bleeding was noted in the stomach. These findings are compatible 
with likely atrophic gastritis.  

Duodenum: Normal duodenum. 

Impression: 
- Presbyesophagus throughout the esophagus
- Atrophic appearing mucosa in the stomach compatible with 
likely atrophic gastritis 
- Medium hiatal hernia
- Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

Summary
=========
___ year old female with history of ___ disease, 
bilateral blindness, hypertension, history of bronchitis and 
reactive airway disease brought to the ED by her son with 
several weeks of recurrent episodes of shortness of breath, 
anxiety, and gasping for air. Patient was evaluated with video 
swallow study which showed esophageal dysmotility and esophageal 
retention of barium. Follow-up EGD was done which showed 
presbyesophagus. Patient was monitored with baseline diet of 
ground solids with thin liquids with medications whole with 
pureed solids. She tolerated the diet well and was discharged 
home

========================================
Acute medical/surgical issues addressed
========================================
# Esophageal dysmotility and esophageal retention of barium on
video swallow:
Patient presented with periordic episodes of shortness of breath 
and anxiety. Suspected that symptoms likely caused by esophageal 
reflux causing her to aspirate which exacerbates her reactive 
airway disease. Certainly ___ puts patient at risk for 
swallowing issues at baseline. Outpatient CT scan did not show 
any obvious esophageal obstruction. No current concern for 
infection given no leukocytosis, evidence on CXR of PNA, and pt 
has no fevers, productive cough. Breathing remained stable on 
room air and O2 sats >90%. Both GERD and reactive airway disease 
treatment were optimized at home and this continued here. Video 
swallow ___ revealed significant esophageal retention of 
barium concerning for severe esophageal dysmotility. GI 
consulted and recommended EGD ___ to evaluate for esophageal 
ring or other structural issue that could be causing retention. 
EGD revealed presbyesophagus and atrophic gastritis. Patient was 
advised to adhere to astrict aspiration precautions at home 
including eating more frequent, smaller meals, taking small 
bites and sips, sitting upright for all meals and medication 
administration and remain sitting upright for 1 hour after 
meals. Please eat only if awake, alert, and attentive.

# Reactive Airway Disease
Patient presented with episodes of SOB and anxiety that may 
represent asthma exacerbations from suspected aspirations. 
Breathing remained stable on room air and O2 sats >90%. 
Optimized reactive airway disease treatment is optimized at home 
with fluticasone IH BID, ipratropium bromide neb q6hs, 
levalbuterol neb q6hours, Perforomist IH BID, and prednisone 
10mg PO daily. While admitted patient was treated with duonebs 
q6hrs, advair BID, and prednisone 10mg daily. At discharge, 
patient was restarted on her home medications.

# Uncomplicated bacterial UTI: Patient asymptomatic but with 
floridly positive UA and urine culture growing E. coli. Patient 
was not oriented this AM but also received Ativan in the ED last 
night. Completed Bactrim DS BID (D1: ___. 

# Hypertension: not taking metoprolol as outpatient. Will need 
to verify medication list with son. ___ pressure well 
controlled overnight and SBP 150s now. Not on Metoprolol as was 
stopped at ___ due to hypotension.

# HLD: continued atorvastatin 20 daily

# GERD: continued pantoprazole 40 mg BID. Patient was discharged 
on pantoprazole 40mg PO BID and Maalox 10mL q6hrs PRN

# ___ disease: continued home Carbidopa-Levodopa 1.5 tab 
QID and 1mg at 7pm. Also continued Carbidopa 25mg QAM per son's 
home med list.

===================
Medication Changes
===================
- None

====================
Transitional Issues
====================
[ ] Continue baseline diet of ground solids with thin liquids 
with medications whole with pureed solids
[ ] Patient is currently taking oral prednisone 10mg daily. 
Appears this was started for possible asthma exacerbation but 
was no end date was given. Will discharge on prednisone 10mg 
daily but recommend tapering as outpatient.
[ ] Please ensure patient doing well with aspiration of cautions 
at home in setting of presbyesophagus.
[ ] If patient is not able to tolerate current diet, diet can be 
downgraded to puree solids. If patient is still having problems 
with aspiration, would have discussion with patient and family

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with history of ___ 
disease, esophageal dysmotility, reactive airway disease 
presenting from home via EMS with inability to ambulate.

History is taken primarily from the patient's son, ___, who is 
at the bedside. He reports that the patient had been in her 
usual state of health until this morning. She gets her 
___ medications at 0700, and then 1000, 1300, 1600, 
___. Her son reports that he gave her the morning dose as 
usual. Then around ___ he tried to get her out of bed, but 
noted that she seemed too weak to stand and had to support her. 
He is not sure whether she seemed more stiff than usual. He then 
gave her the 1000 dose of carbidopa/levodopa, thinking that this 
may be related to her ___ (the patient's Neurologist has 
been uptitrating her dose recently). The patient was able to 
stand after getting her 1000 dose of medication, but she still 
seemed more weak than usual, so he called the ambulance.

Upon EMS arrival she was also found to be hypoxic. She has not 
been expressing any shortness of breath prior to EMS arrival. 
Her son reports that due to her esophageal dysmotility she 
someone has choking/aspiration episodes, but he states that she 
has not had any on the day of presentation. No cough. No fevers, 
chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria, or increased 
urinary frequency. Her son reports that she has not been eating 
or drinking much today. 

Of note, the patient was recently admitted from ___ with 
hypoxia that was thought to be due to viral upper respiratory 
infection triggering reactive airway disease.

In the ED, vitals: 98.5 88 95/58 24 94% 2L NC 

Exam: The patient is alert and oriented ×2. She is in no acute 
respiratory distress. She is tremulous. Eye exam limited due to

Brief Hospital Course:
Brief summary: 

This is a ___ with ___ disease, esophageal dysmotility, 
reactive airway disease presenting from home via EMS with 
inability to ambulate. In the ED she was hypotensive, 
transiently mildly hypoxic, and clearly weak and 
encephalopathic. She was found to have a UTI and also thought to 
be hypovolemic. She improved very impressively with fluid 
resuscitation and antibiotic therapy, to near-baseline (though 
very poor functional status at this baseline). Her antibiotics 
were transitioned to a narrowed spectrum oral regimen prior to 
discharge.

Detailed summary:

# Urinary tract infection: Patient presenting with inability to 
ambulate, found to have positive urinalysis on admission. 
Patient denied symptoms, and was afebrile and without 
leukocytosis, but given her encephalopathy and difficulty 
ambulating, treatment was initiated with ceftriaxone. She 
improved with therapy. Urine culture with >100K E coli, 
pansusceptible. Narrowed to amoxicillin at discharge.
- Complete course of amoxicillin 500mg PO TID x5 more days

# Acute toxic metabolic encephalopathy: Patient sleepy but 
arousable on initial interview, with subsequent course notable 
for waxing/waning alertness. She improved with treatment of UTI 
and dehydration/hypovolemia.

# Inability to ambulate: Patient presenting with inability to 
ambulate, likely due to hypovolemia and UTI. Patient was noted 
to have right nasolabial flattening on exam, son is not sure if 
this was new; neurological exam otherwise seems to be at 
baseline and strength intact in upper and lower extremities and 
head CT was performed for this reason and was negative - likely 
gravitational based on serial exams. She was continued on her 
usual ___ disease medications. Her physical functioning 
improved to near-baseline (which is poor) after treatment of 
UTI/dehydration. She was seen by ___ who recommended discharge 
back to home with 24 hour care.

# Hypotension
# Hypovolemia/dehydration: Patient noted on arrival to be 
hypotensive to the systolic ___, not clearly symptomatic. 
Patient appeared dry on exam, and per report from son has not 
had much to eat or drink day of admission. BPs improved with 
IVF. Of note, patient also on prednisone 10 mg per day at home, 
completed steroid taper from last admission.

# Acute hypoxic respiratory failure: Patient found to be 
hypoxic, requiring 1L oxygen via NC in the ED. Patient was able 
to be weaned to room air upon arrival. CXR clear without 
evidence of pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or aspiration. On exam, 
patient has no wheezing to suggest acute exacerbation of her 
reactive airway disease. ___ have been aspiration event.  
Followed by Dr. ___. Home medications were continued.

# Thrush: Mild. Resolved with some nystatin. 
- Rinse mouth after inhaled steroids

# Esophageal dysmotility: Continued aspiration precautions with 
pureed solids and thickened liquids. She was seen by SLP who 
felt she was doing fairly well and could likely tolerate thin 
liquids (no straws).

# Anemia: Chronic, stable
# ___ disease: Continued carbidopa/levodopa
# Glaucoma: Continued eye gtts
# Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine
# Hypertension: Controlled without medications
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued atorvastatin
# Anxiety: Continued alprazolam as needed
# Insomnia: Continued trazodone; substitute ramelteon for 
melatonin

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF SUMMARY: 

___ with advanced ___ disease, dementia, esophageal 
motility, reactive airway disease presenting with tachypnea in 
the setting of severe constipation. It was thought that she was 
tachypneic due to (1) alteration of respiratory mechanics in the 
setting of abdominal distension from constipation along with (2) 
some aspiration occurring in the setting of her chronic 
oropharyngeal and esophageal dysphagia worsened by the 
aforementioned tachypnea and missing her ___ 
medications. Tachypnea slowly resolved as her constipation 
resolved and she was kept NPO. She was evaluated by SLP during 
this resolution phase and was cleared for her usual diet. She 
appeared to return to her usual baseline and so was discharged 
to home with her usual services and her sons' excellent 
attentive care.

DETAILED SUMMARY:

# Tachypnea
# Mild intermittent hypoxia
# Acute hypoxic respiratory failure
# Esophageal dysmotility: Likely aspiration in setting of 
advanced reactive airways disease and underlying restrictive 
lung mechanics due to advanced kyphosis. This was all likely 
worsened/precipitated by progressive constipation, for which she 
is unable to compensate due to her kyphosis -- leads to 
tachypnea and then tachypnea leads to aspiration which then 
precipitates a viscious cycle of more tachypnea and aspiration. 
Missing her medications also likely contributing. SLP evaluated 
her ___ and felt she was unsafe for any PO, but she appeared to 
do better ___ so diet was advanced and she tolerated this well. 
She appeared to return to her baseline by today ___ and so was 
discharged home.
- Note: A G tube can be considered for her, if in the future she 
really cannot meet her nutritional goals and can't take meds, 
but when we involved her in the discussion she said she did not 
want one. She improved so this was not explored further, but it 
may present a potential barrier to pursuing tube placement in 
the future. 

# Constipation: Severe on presentation but now moving her 
bowels. We adjusted her bowel medications to maintain 1BM per 
day. Counselled son on the following regimen:
- Standing senna now BID, Miralax now daily
- PRN Bisacodyl given HS if no BM that day

# Acute toxic metabolic encephalopathy
# Dementia: Baseline cognitive status per ___ is ""pretty high 
functioning,"" but apparently always thinks that it is ___ 
(with air conditioning always on at home), and is not oriented 
to events. Agitation on admission likely driven by recent 
constipation followed by repeated visits to the ED overnight. At 
home pt is maintained on low dose alprazolam which typically 
provides benefit for her anxiety and agitation. She improved by 
the AM after admission and appeared to be at her baseline for 
the remainder of her hospital stay.

# Advanced ___ disease: Slowly progressive per its usual 
course. Now quite advanced. Most of her above issues are the 
result of this condition. Her home medications were continued 
according to her precise home schedule and she did well. 
Neurology was not consulted this admission given her 
improvement. 

# Anemia: Chronic, stable
# Glaucoma: Continued home eye gtts
# Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued atorvastatin
# Anxiety: Continued alprazolam as needed
# Insomnia: Continued low dose home trazodone; substitute 
ramelteon for melatonin

Brief Hospital Course:
# Hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen: 
The etiology of the patient's hypoxia at home is unclear.  Her 
oxygen saturations improved quickly when she reached ___ 
ED and she was on room air when she arrived at ___.  Chest XR 
did now show a pneumonia.  I suspect she was having trouble 
clearing her throat due to lethargy (side-effect from prior 
Xanax use) and had a transient airway obstruction or mucus plug 
as the source of her hypoxia.  While she was in the hospital she 
was continued on her home duonebs, flovent and prednisone.  Her 
son ___ plans to only give her half of a Xanax for anxiety in 
the future.

# Toxic Metabolic Encephalopathy: 
Her altered mental status at the time of admission was likely 
from a combination of medication side-effect (Xanax) as well as 
urinary tract infection.  UA was positive and urine culture grew 
> 100,000 CFU pan sensitive Klebsiella.  She completed a course 
of antibiotics while hospitalized.  Sedating medications were 
used sparingly and son ___ try melatonin for sleep rather 
than a benzodiazepine.  Trazodone was held.  

# Troponinemia:
- Initial troponin at ___ was 0.02.  She was 
transferred to ___ for further evaluation.  Her troponins 
trended 0.02 --> 0.02 --> <0.01.  Her EKG was unchanged from her 
baseline and she did not show any signs of ACS.

# Constipation: Continue senna, Miralax, bisacodyl

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS:
# Anemia: Chronic, stable
# Glaucoma: Continued home eye gtts
# Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued atorvastatin
# Anxiety: Continued alprazolam sparingly as needed
# Insomnia: Substitute melatonin for trazodone at discharge
# GERD: Nexium

Appeal of Discharge: Patient's son ___ appealed his mother's 
discharge.  He had a few concerns as follows.  He wanted his 
mother to complete the course of antibiotics in the hospital.  I 
explained that this was not necessary since we had culture data 
to ensure good response to PO medications.  He wanted his mother 
to have a feeding tube placed.  While this can be considered, 
___ had recently passed a swallow evaluation and had done well 
with her medications and honey thick diet in the hospital.  She 
showed no signs of aspiration.  When I initially discussed a 
feeding tube with ___, she said she did not want one.  I 
advised ___ to discuss this topic further with his PCP and 
___.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Urinary Tract Infection

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Bedbound.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with altered mental status and decreased 
oxygen levels.  You were likely altered (confused, not acting 
yourself) since you had a urinary tract infection and you had 
taken a sedating medication, Xanax, the night before.  You were 
given an antibiotic to treat your pneumonia. 

You also had low oxygen levels at home.  Since you were confused 
and sleepy, you likely had trouble clearing your mucus 
secretions.  This brief mucus blockage was the likely cause of 
your low oxygen level at home.  You did not show any signs of 
pneumonia and your oxygen levels quickly returned to normal.

At home, please ensure you give yourself adequate time to eat 
your meals.  Please decrease use of sedating medications like 
Xanax or take half a pill of Xanax.  You will follow-up with 
your primary care doctor and ___ as below.

IMAGING/STUDIES
================

CT ABD/PELVIS ___
1. No acute abnormality within the abdomen or pelvis. 
2. Sigmoid diverticulosis, without evidence of acute 
diverticulitis. 
3. Stable compression deformities of the T11, L1, and L2 
vertebral bodies. 

CXR ___
Left basilar atelectasis.  No definite acute cardiopulmonary 
abnormality.

G-TUBE PLACEMENT ___
A 65 cm, 5 ___ glide catheter was negotiated through the 
Nares down to the stomach using a 0.035 glidewire.  Position in 
the stomach was confirmed with injection of air.  The tube was 
then secured and used for insufflation.  A scout image of the 
abdomen was obtained. The stomach was insufflated through the 
indwelling nasogastric tube. Under fluoroscopic guidance, 2 T 
fastener buttons were sequentially deployed elevating the 
stomach to the anterior abdominal wall. Intra-gastric position 
was confirmed with aspiration of air and injection of contrast. 
A 19 gauge needle was introduced under fluoroscopic guidance and 
position confirmed using an injection of dilute contrast. A 
Amplatz wire was introduced into the  stomach. A small skin 
incision was made along the needle and the needle was removed. 
After sequential dilation using 12, 14 in 16 ___ dilators, a 
18 ___  peel-away sheath was placed.  A 14 ___ MIC 
gastrostomy catheter was advanced over the wire into position. 
The catheter was secured by instilling dilute contrast into the 
balloon.  Contrast injection confirmed intragastric  position.  
The catheter was then flushed, capped and secured. Sterile 
dressings were applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well 
and there were no immediate 
complications. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with ___ disease, esophageal dysmotility, dementia 
who presented with hip pain versus abdominal pain, developed 
acute hypoxia while in the ED from aspiration. Admitted to the 
hospital for hypoxia.

#GOALS OF CARE:
#CHRONIC ASPIRATION
#UNINTENTIONAL WEIGHT LOSS
   The patient has oropharyngeal dysphagia due to her advanced 
___ disease and esophageal dysphagia due to her 
esophageal dysmotility. She had been taking a honey-thick diet 
at home (mostly Boost), but had been losing weight despite the 
heroic efforts of her son to encourage oral feedings, and also 
had a clinically overt aspiration event in the ED despite 
texture modification of her diet. She was seen by speech and 
swallow, who felt that even if we thicken food enough to help 
with the oropharyngeal phase of swallow, there is little we can 
do about the esophageal issue; she was recommended for strict 
NPO. 
    Given that the dysphagia is related to issues other than her 
dementia (which is not end-stage), we felt she would be a 
candidate for a feeding tube, if within the goals of care. It 
was difficult to directly understand the patient's own goals - 
there is prior documentation that the patient would refuse a 
feeding tube, and she was able to say in AM on ___ (in front 
of myself, attending MD, RN, and son) that she would not want a 
feeding tube. Since then, she said ""I'm thinking about it"" when 
asked about wanting a feeding tube. It was very difficult to 
interpret patient's wishes in this setting, and as such, we had 
to rely on the patient's son and HCP ___, who is her 
___ caregiver at home. We discussed with him that feeding tubes 
do not eliminate the risk of aspiration, but that it would 
probably be safer than oral feedings and would at least help to 
deliver nutrition more reliably and successfully. After some 
vacillation, he ultimately decided he was strongly in favor of a 
feeding tube.
    As such, interventional radiology was consulted and a PEG 
was successfully placed on ___. Tube feeds initiated on 
___ - pt tolerated well prior to discharge. She will receive 
cycled tube feeds 16 hours per day. She is also continued on her 
home BID PPI (to reduce the acidity of gastric contents should 
she micro-aspirate) and on BID chlorhexidine mouthwash.

#ACUTE HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE:
#REACTIVE AIRWAY DISEASE:
#CHRONIC ASPIRATION RISK:
    Hypoxia resolved over time - ultimately it was attributed to 
aspiration pneumonitis. She is followed by Dr ___ 
pulmonology - she does not have a formal pulmonary diagnosis, as 
she is unable to cooperate for PFTs, but seems to have some mild 
pulmonary fibrosis and some kind of reactive airway disease. No 
symptoms this admission suggestive of exacerbation of reactive 
airway disease. She was continued on all of her home 
inhalers/nebulizers. 

#RIGHT SIDE PAIN:
   Pt had originally presented with pain in R side while 
ambulating - though per prior ___ records, pt is largely 
wheelchair bound and requires a lift at home for transfers, so 
unclear how much she is ambulating. She has no pain on arrival 
to the floor and no pain is elicited on exam. Had CT abd without 
any findings to explain possible RLQ pain. Has had intermittent 
constipation; ensured robust bowel regimen. Clinically felt to 
be consistent with muscle spasms in the setting of PD - treated 
with ibuprofen and acetaminophen.

#HYPERNATREMIA:
   Na 149 on admission, suspect it is due to limited free water 
intake (in the setting of needing nectar-thickened liquids). 
Resolved once started on tube feeds with free water flushes.

#PARKINSONS DISEASE:
   Has progressive ___ disease with associated 
esophageal dysmotility. Continued home carbidopa-levodopa. 
Continued home Hyoscyamine 0.125 mg SL TID:PRN esophageal spasm

#DEMENTIA:
Probably moderate in severity, but hard to assess given her 
difficulty communicating in the setting her advanced PD. Mental 
status at baseline, per son.

#HLD:
Continued home atorvastatin 20mg daily.

#HYPOTHYROIDISM:
Continued home Levothyroxine 25 mcg PO/NG DAILY.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
==================
[] Started on home tube feeds (supplied via ___. Some meds 
have been changed to liquid or crushable formulations.
[] Please note that her son is very involved in her care and 
provides her with excellent (essentially LTAC-level) elder care 
at home. However, his high standards for care quality and his 
granular involvement in details of care can at times interfere 
with care delivery. For any subsequent admissions, please refer 
to ""Team Meeting"" note from ___ for details on agreements 
that have been reached with ___ about boundaries on his intimate 
involvement with his mother's inpatient care.

Dx: ___ disease, esophageal dysmotility
___: 13 months

 
Discharge Disposition:
Home With Service
 
Facility:
___
 
Discharge Diagnosis:
PRIMARY DIAGNOSES: 
Acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to aspiration 
___ disease 
Esophageal dysmotility 
 
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 
Muscle spasms 
 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or 
wheelchair.

 
Discharge Instructions:
WHY WERE YOU ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL?
- Your oxygen level was low and you were requiring extra oxygen.

WHAT HAPPENED WHILE YOU WERE IN THE HOSPITAL?
- You had multiple episodes of aspiration while you were here; 
ultimately, it was decided that you would have a feeding tube 
placed. You had a G-tube placed and started to receive nutrition 
that way.
- You were seen by our nutritionists and speech/language 
pathologists - it was determined that, due to your risk of 
aspiration, it was not safe for you to eat or drink anything by 
mouth. You should get all of your nutrition and medicines 
through your feeding tube. 
- You were given fluid through an IV.
- Your oxygen level improved and was stable without extra 
oxygen.
- We gave you Tylenol and ibuprofen for the pain in your right 
side.

WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN YOU LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?
- Continue to take all of your medicines as prescribed.
- Continue your nutrition through your feeding tube. We 
recommend that, if you truly want to minimize your risk of 
aspiration, you do not eat or drink anything by mouth. 
- That said... many people sometimes decide to do unsafe things 
that make them happy. If you feel it is important for quality of 
life to accept the risk of taking a few sips of honey-thick 
liquid once in a while, that is not totally unreasonable. People 
want to stay healthy, but they want to be happy too! 
- Please keep all of your appointments, as scheduled.

-___ CXR (portable):
IMPRESSION: Study is limited as the patient's head obscures the
lung apex on the left. There are very low lung volumes.  There 
is
extensive osteopenia and several old rib fractures bilateral. 
There is coarsening of the bronchovascular markings bilaterally
without overt pulmonary edema or focal consolidation.  No
definite pneumothoraces are identified.  Overall findings are
unchanged.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Presented with reported productive cough, dyspnea, and lethargy. 
Disconcertingly, but consistently, her son, ___ would 
often say that she had a symptom, but when the patient was asked 
how she was feeling or asked specifically about that symptom, 
she would often say she was not feeling that way.

She did have a productive cough, however she did not demonstrate 
dyspnea or lethargy during her hospital course. Her CXR was not 
consistent with PNA. She had no other findings to suggest a 
bacterial infection. It was thought this represented a possible 
exacerbation of her chronic ""reactive airway disease"" which, 
itself, does not seem to have a clear underlying etiology, 
though perhaps may be due to chronic aspiration. She was treated 
with her usual home medications and she did well. No additional 
steroids were given and no antibiotics were given.

Leading up to the time of discharge, the patient's son made 
numerous requests of additional testing in an apparent attempt 
to delay and/or prevent discharge. He made all of these requests 
under the auspices of ""advocating for my mother,"" but many of 
the requests were made repeatedly, and aggressively towards the 
nursing staff, despite clear counseling by the patient's 
physicians that the tests were not necessary and would not be 
performed/repeated. His requests also did not align with the 
patient's clinical condition. On the day prior to discharge and 
the day of discharge, the patient herself noted that she felt 
quite good, was not having shortness of breath, and overall felt 
better than prior to admission. She was not noted to have any 
periods of significant dyspnea that did not respond to her usual 
home nebulizer treatments, and she was not noted to be lethargic 
during her time in the hospital.

We counseled her son that ongoing long-term prednisone use may 
not be advisable in her case.  Specifically, prednisone 
increases her risk of skin injuries (she has some already), 
slowed wound healing, osteoporosis with more fragility fractures 
(she has several already), anxiety (which has been increasingly 
problematic per family), and stomach ulcers (particularly when 
combined with Advil she takes for pain).  We advised that they 
discuss this further with Dr. ___ primary pulmonologist.

upper lobe 
atelectasis/early infiltrates in the appropriate clinical 
setting.  The lower  lobes on both sides in the left upper lobe 
are clear. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with ___ disease, esophageal dysmotility w/ chronic 
aspirations s/p PEG for feeding, reactive airway disease on 
chronic glucocorticoids, presenting with increased PEG-tube 
residuals, found to have suspected pneumonia and rib fractures 
on CT chest. Patient received treatment for pneumonia and had 
persistent
episodes of hypoxemia due to aspiration from esophageal 
dysmotility, extreme kyphosis and atelectasis, dyskinesias from 
___ disease and underlying lung disease from COPD and
bronchiectasis. The patient was planned for discharge with 
appropriate ___ services and home O2 services, but patient son 
appealed the discharge. The case was reviewed by medicare who 
agreed with the medical team. 

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
#Community acquired pneumonia
Patient has chronic cough with multiple recent admissions for 
increased cough and lethargy (per son's report, but some 
discrepancy w/ clinician observation, per prior notes). Has been 
afebrile, but has a mild lekocytosis, soft BPs, and a lingular 
consolidation on CT. Therefore, treated for CAP. That being 
said, CT changes and low-grade leukocytosis may simply represent 
pneumonitis from chronic aspiration +/- atelectasis. Treated 
with IV ceftriaxone/azithromycin for a total 5 day course 
(___). Persistent O2 requirement discussed below. 

#COPD
#Bronchiectasis 
#Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure 
Patient has been on 10 mg prednisone for some time now. Son 
called her pulmonologist due to perceived increase in WOB and 
respiratory distress and he recommended increasing prednisone to 
40 mg daily (she received 2 doses of 40 mg). On exam, patient 
was mildly tachypneic but without wheezing. Did not start 
prednisone burst, as pt has had well-documented 
prednisone-related side effects, and her respiratory status 
appears stable. She was continued on her home fluticasone, 
ipratropium, levalbuterol, and fomoterol breathing treatments, 
and prednisone 10mg qd. She was given guaifenasin q6h prn. Her 
fluctuations in respiratory function and persistent O2 
requirement despite treatment for CAP and COPD is likely due to 
chronic aspiration from esophageal dysmotility, extreme kyphosis 
and atelectasis, dyskinesias from ___ disease and 
underlying lung disease from COPD and bronchiectasis. The 
patient was discharged with home oxygen. She will have follow up 
with her pulmonologist to determine taper for prednisone. 

#Acute, subacute, and chronic rib fractures
Likely related to osteoporosis (w/ progressive demineralization 
from chronic prednisone use) and chronic cough. Evaluated by 
trauma, who do not recommend any surgical intervention. 

#Esophageal dysmotility
#Tube feed residuals 
Patient had one episode of 300 cc TF residual without any sign 
of clinical obstruction. Informed son that residuals do not need 
be checked regularly. Tube feeds were transitioned to the AM 
hours for 17 hours/day given family concern for aspirations from 
tube feeds. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
___ Disease 
Continued home carbidopa-levodopa

DISCHARGE APPEAL
================
  Repeated discussions with ___ (Son-HCP) were held 
regarding the poor prognosis for ___.  She is prone to 
aspirations, recurrent hypoxia with repeated mucous plugging.  
Given her Parksinson's, esophageal dysmotility, kyphosis and 
deconditioning, little can be done to prevent these aspirations 
from recurring.  She already has a PEG tube in place.  Despite 
efforts to impart the fact that providing ongoing care may 
actually be counterproductive, he did not appear willing to 
listen and insisted that everything should be done.  
   He appealed the discharge to Medicare - and the decision was 
made in agreement with our assessment.  She was discharged home 
with added oxygen, suctioning equipment and followup.  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================

[] Pulmonology: will work on tapering prednisone.
[] Neurology: continue to optimize sinemet. After receiving 
sinemet, patient is having significant dyskinesias exacerbating 
oxygen desaturations. 
[] Patient has a suction machine to help clear her secretions. 
The patient will need to have a renewed script to resupply the 
machine versus obtain a new machine. 
[] Patient was discharged with home oxygen. Continue to reassess 
need for oxygen. 
[] Continue to discuss with family that checking tube feed 
residuals are not necessary and have not been proven to show any 
benefit. 
[] Continue to reinforce the patient's progressive decline from 
underlying chronic medical diseases.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:
========
Ms. ___ is ___ female with past medical history of 
___ disease, advanced dementia, esophageal dysmotility 
w/ chronic aspirations s/p PEG for feeding, reactive airway 
disease on chronic glucocorticoids who presented with increased 
work of breathing and increased cough with sputum/secretions, 
found to have acute hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure, 
MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia, frequent bradycardia, and 
hypotension. 

ACUTE ISSUES 
=============== 
# Acute hypoxemic hypercarbic respiratory failure 
Initially presenting with hypoxia. Her respiratory failure 
worsened and was started on HFNC and eventually was intubated on 
___ after goals of care discussions with the family. She was 
given aggressive pulmonary toilet. Attempts to wean the 
ventilator were not successful, so she ultimately underwent 
tracheostomy placement and bronchoscopy on ___. Patient 
continued to have intermittent low minute ventilation so 
required switching from pressure support to volume control. She 
will need ongoing ventilator weaning after discharge. 

# Sepsis secondary to HAP
# MRSA pneumonia
# Pseudomonas PNA
CXR demonstrated findings concerning for multifocal pneumonia. 
Her sputum grew MRSA and Pseudomonas. For her MRSA pneumonia, 
she was given 10 days of vancomycin. For her Pseudomonas 
infection, she was initially treated with cefepime, but 
ultimately transitioned to IV ciprofloxacin for an additional 7 
days after her Pseudomonas developed intermediate sensitivities 
to cefepime. Last day of ciprofloxacin is ___. 

# Hypotension
Requiring pressors after being intubated. Likely ___ sedatives 
and sepsis. Given norepi for goal MAP >65. She did 
intermittently have brief hypotensive episodes throughout 
hospitalization that were fluid responsive. There may have been 
a component of difficulty measuring BPs given frequent 
movements. 

# Reactive airway disease/COPD
# Chronic aspiration
Patient has been on long-standing prednisone. Concern for 
chronic aspiration in the setting of esophageal dysmotility with 
kyphosis and dyskinesias from ___. Given high dose 
prednisone (50 mg) for 5 days followed by taper in addition to 
aggressive nebulizer regimen. She will be maintained on her home 
prednisone dose of 10 mg PO daily afterwards. 

# Recurrent episodes of bradycardia 
Before intubation, patient would intermittently have bradycardic 
episodes including a 10-second pause on telemetry in the setting 
of hypoxia and discomfort. Electrophysiology was consulted who 
did not feel that this regard prior to pacemaker placement. 
These episodes did not recur after intubation. Likely related to 
vagal episodes. 

# Coag negative staph in blood cultures 
Grown in one set of cultures, thought to be ___ contamination. 

# Diarrhea
C. diff negative. Likely ___ tube feeds. 

# Skin excoriations in groin
Foley placed for skin breakdown on external genitalia ___ 
urinary incontinence. 

# Hypernatremia
Likely ___ poor PO intake. Resolved with increased free water 
flushes. 

# Anemia
# Thrombocytopenia
Likely secondary to sepsis and antibiotics. Improved with 
treatment of infections. 

CHRONIC PROBLEMS:
=================
# Subacute and chronic rib fractures
Found on prior admission and thought to be due to chronic cough 
and osteoporosis. Continued Tylenol, ibuprofen and lidocaine 
patches. 

# ___ Disease
# Advanced dementia
Continued home carbidopa-levodopa and carbidopa. 

# Esophageal dysmotility
Continued tube feeds through PEG

# HLD
Continued home atorvastatin daily 

# GERD
Continued home lansoprazole 30 mg PO BID 

# Hypothyroidism
Continued home levothyroxine 25 mcg daily 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[] Continue IV ciprofloxacin to end on ___
[] Please attempt to wean ventilator support 
[] Continue goals of care discussions if unable to be weaned 
from ventilator 
[] Please remove foley and attempt voiding trial
[] Pseudomonas developed resistance to cefepime, ceftazadime, 
and piperacillin-tazobactam. Please avoid use of these 
antibiotics in the future if concern for pneumonia
[] Prednisone taper
___: 20 mg x2 days
___: 10 mg PO daily indefinitely

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,  

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___!  

Why was I admitted to the hospital?  
=================================
- You were admitted because you were having difficulty breathing 
and were found to have a pneumonia.

What happened while I was in the hospital?  
====================================
- You had testing done to figure out what kind of pneumonia you 
had.  This showed you had 2 infections call MRSA and 
Pseudomonas.
 You were given IV antibiotics to treat these infections.
 You were given higher dose prednisone to help with 
inflammation in your lungs. 
 We placed you on a breathing machine called a ventilator to 
help you breath. Because you could not breathe without this 
machine, a tracheostomy (breathing tube in the neck) was placed, 
which will help you to breathe with the support of the 
ventilator, but be more comfortable. 

What should I do after leaving the hospital?  
============================================
- Please take your medications as listed in discharge summary 
and follow up at the listed appointments. 

Thank you for allowing us to be involved in your care, we wish 
you all the best!  

Sincerely,

Your ___ Healthcare Team

History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ year old woman with history of advanced
___, advanced dementia, bilateral blindness, reactive
airway disease on chronic prednisone, HTN, HLD, COPD,
hypothyroidism, and recent admission for MRSA and pseudomonas
PNA, which resulted in trach/peg, now with vent dependence, who
now presents from her rehab (___) with fevers despite 
multiple
courses of antibiotics.

Since her last discharge for MRSA and pseudomonas (with 
inducible
resistance to cefepime and ceftaz) PNA, she has been on
antibiotics for resistant organisms for all but ~5 days. She has
been followed by ID while at ___, and while there, was
on vanc/cipro -> bactrim/meropenem (for stenotrophomonas and
pseudomonas) -> vancomycin/ceftaz-avibactam. She was scheduled 
to
continue Vancomycin and ceftaz/avibactam until ___ but
continued to spike fevers as high as ___, so she was sent to
___ for further evaluation per the son's request. Patient is
non-verbal and unable to provide meaningful history or ROS. She
is confirmed full code.

Of note, according to a progress note from ___ on ___
the son has been verbally abusive and yelling at staff 
requesting
that ""full investigation of all patient's current medical
problems and maximal support."" 

In the ED, 

Initial Vitals: T 99.7, HR 96, BP 176/86, RR 20 on vent.

Exam: Chronically ill appearing, frail, appears uncomfortable.
Trach midline, no surrounding erythema or drainage. Diminished

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old woman with history of advanced ___, 
bilateral blindness, reactive airway disease on chronic 
prednisone, HTN, HLD, COPD, hypothyroidism, and recent admission 
for MRSA and pseudomonas PNA, which resulted in trach/peg, now 
with vent dependence, who now presents from her rehab (___) 
with persistent fevers and leukocytosis despite broad spectrum 
ABX for PNA, found to have bilateral UE DVT. Fevers likely 
non-infectious, so antibiotics discontinued. Patient stable and 
discharged back to ___. 

ACUTE ISSUES 
=============== 
# Fevers
Patient presents from ___ with persistent fevers and 
mild leukocytosis despite broad spectrum coverage for her 
resistant PNAs. ID was consulted and felt that her culture data 
likely reflects colonization, given her non-inflammatory sputum 
studies, stable vent settings, and stable secretions. The most 
likely etiology of her fevers is non infectious such as drug 
fever or ___ DVT. Notably, she was found to
have RUE DVT of brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins of the 
RUE. She was also found to have LUE DVT of axillary veins (with 
PICC still in place). It is possible this could be contributing 
to her fevers. Less likely new or persistent bacterial 
infection, though viral infection could be considered. Flu neg. 

# Bilateral UE Catheter Associated DVT:
Patient presented with RUE edema, found to have RUE thrombi of 
the brachial (non-occlusive), cephalic (occlusive), and basilic 
(non-occlusive) veins. This occurred in the setting of RUE PICC 
placed in the R basilic vein last admission (subsequently 
removed). She was also found to have partially occlusive LUE 
thrombi within the axillary (deep) and proximal basilic veins, 
with PICC still in place due to necessity of frequent lab draws. 
After extensive conversation with the patient's son (HCP) re: 
risks and benefits of anticoagulation, it was ultimately decided 
to anticoagulate with warfarin, with lovneox bridge. She will 
need repeat ultrasounds to assess for clot resolution on 
anticoagulation, minimum planned duration 3 months. Will also 
need to monitor for e/o active bleeding.

# L UE Erythema
The patient was found to have L upper arm erythema in the 
setting of L UE DVT, with some excoriations of the skin. Given 
improvement with topical emollients and without antibiotics, 
this was thought to be excoriation in the setting of her chronic 
steroid use, and less likely an overlying cellulitis. This 
should continue to be monitored at ___.

# Chronic Hypoxic respiratory failure: 
The patient is trached and vent dependent in the setting of 
advanced dementia. Her Trach cuff pressures were within normal 
limits(28). She was continued on her outpatient ventilator 
settings of CMV overnight and PSV during day. Trach sputum 
cultures grew pseudomonas, but given low PMNs and scant sputum 
production with stable vent settings, suspect colonization as 
opposed to active infection.

# Normocytic Anemia
The patient has a recent baseline Hgb of 7.5-8.5, and has 
required 2u PRBC while at
___. Did have guaiac + stools there, though no evidence of 
overt bleeding. Could represent a slow GIB vs marrow suppression 
in the setting of recent infections. s/p 1UPRBC with robust 
response supporting that acute bleed is less likely. Iron 
studies suggest anemia of chronic inflammation.

CHRONIC ISSUES 
=============== 
# Esophageal dysmotility: s/p PEG: The patient was continued on 
nutrition's final tube feed recs from her last admission

# ___: Continued home carbidopa/levodopa regimen

# HLD: Continued home statin

# Chronic pain: Continued APAP. Home NSAIDs were held in the 
setting of anemia. 

# Reactive airway disease, copd: Continued home prednisone 10mg 
daily and home inhalers

___ with h/o advanced ___, dementia, blindness, HTN, 
HLD,
COPD, hypothyroidism, who is now ___ dependent after
pseudomonas pneumonia presents to the ED with c/o respiratory
distress. She was discharged from rehab yesterday. ___ reports
that she had been doing well at ___. About ___ weeks ago she
had a pneumonia that was treated w/ antibiotics he is unsure 
what
kind. He notes increased upper airway sounds especially when she
is on a trach mask. He had requested a CXR at ___ but they did
not do one. He says she had no oral temperatures there. He says
she has been doing well and continues to communicate when there
they create a leak in her trach. Additionally she raises her
right hand with issues. Lately she has been raising her right
hand with concerns when he asks her. Lately it has been with 
pain
in her back. 

She came home to her son yesterday. He noted that she has had
intermittent episodes of having respiratory rates of ___ and
then it will go up to 30 for a few seconds and back down. He is
concerned this is new for her and he talked to a respiratory
therapist who he has on call who recommended she get evaluated. 

While at OSH she had episodes of tachypnea. CXR was c/f
persistent pneumonia with lactate 2.2. She was given a dose of
Vancomycin and Cefepime and transferred to ___.

Of note the patient had persistent fevers in the past despite
broad spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia. ID has been consulted
in the past and felt that she likely has colonization. They
believe she likely had fevers due to non-infectious source or
drug fever. She had a DVT in her RUE brachial, basilica and
cephalic veins. She also had LUE DVT of the axillary. The
decision last admission, despite many risks was to
anticoagulation with warfarin with a lovenox bridge. She was to
get 3 weeks of anticoagulation as she had a PICC in place. She
remained vent dependent previously. 

In the ED she had a fever to 101.4. She had a HR of 81, RR 14.
She was on her home ventilator settings of CMV, 400/10/5/28%. 

Her exam showed bilateral rhonchi, no sores appreciated or other
abnormalities.   

Lab work up showed a VBG 7.46/45. Lactate 1.3. WBC 8.0 
Hemoglobin
9.4. Remaining lab work was pending at time of transfer. Lactate
2.2 at OSH vanc and Cefepime given at OSH. Started on NS. 

ROS: Positives as per HPI; otherwise negative.

Brief Hospital Course:
PATIENT SUMMARY
===================
Ms ___ is a ___ year old woman with history of advanced 
___, bilateral blindness, reactive airway disease on 
chronic prednisone, HTN, HLD, COPD, hypothyroidism, and recent 
admission for MRSA and pseudomonas PNA which resulted in 
___, now with vent dependence (___), who now 
presents from her home w/ tachypnea (intermittent) found on last 
admission to have bl UE DVT (transitioned to warfarin). She has 
no leukocytosis on admission and no further fevers over one in 
ED. Staph coag negative at ___ and ___ culture, likely both 
contaminants.

ACUTE ISSUES 
=============== 
# Fever (noted x 1)
Most likely still colonized as noted before. Contaminated sputum 
here, CXR w/o PNA. No leukocytosis and maintains baseline 
tachypnea per prior providers. She finished her last course of 
antibiotics ___ weeks ago at ___. White count stable, no 
tachycardia. Afebrile other than 1 ED rectal temperature. One 
blood culuture at OSH and one blood culture at ___ with staph 
epi (one at OSH, one ___, but stable, thus thought to both be 
contaminants). 

#Chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure
#Trach dependent
Gas on admission reassuring. Continued home settings on trach, 
weaned as tolerated. She transitioned to trach mask, and 
intermittently used the ventilator if she appeared to be in 
respiratory distress. However this was weaned throughout her 
stay, and she was stably maintained on trach mask before 
discharge, with oxygen saturations 98-100% on 35% FiO2 and no 
respiratory distress. She did not need mechanical ventilation 
for 36 hours prior to discharge. 

# Bilateral UE Catheter Associated DVT:
Diagnosed previous admission ___ - ___. Repeat 
ultrasound here showed no evdience of DVT in upper extremity 
veins in setting of Warfarin since discharge in ___. Plan to 
continue anticoag until end of ___ with warfarin goal INR ___, 
with consideration of transitioning to enoxaparin ___omplete for lifelong anticoagulation, as she has a 
propensity to develop venothromboemboli. 

# Normocytic anemia
The patient has a recent baseline Hgb of 7.5-8.5m/dL. Iron 
studies from her last admission suggest anemia of chronic 
inflammation. She requires intermittent transfusions. 

# Severe protein-calorie malnutrition
She was continued on tube feeds per recommendation of the 
Nutrition service. 

CHRONIC ISSUES 
=============== 
# Esophageal dysmotility: s/p ___: The patient was continued on 
the Nutrition service's final tube feed recs from her last 
admission

# ___: Continued home carbidopa/levodopa regimen 
(adjusted while at ___)

# HLD: Continued home statin

# Chronic pain: We transitioned standing acetaminophen to PRN as 
she did not appear in pain, and nodded no when asked if she was 
in any pain. Home NSAIDs were held in the setting of anemia. She 
should continue on as-needed pain control with acetaminophen or 
very low dose oxycodone. 

# Reactive airway disease, copd: Taper prednisone as below in 
transitional issues

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[] if patient to go home in future, continue trach/vent teaching 
w/ son
[] continue on going discussions w/ family regarding prognosis 
and goals of care
[] Please discuss with family long-term anticoagulation given 
propensity for venous thromboembolism. 
[] Patient does well on trach mask, only needs ventilator if o2 
sat decreases or she appears in respiratory distress. 
[] prednisone taper as follows: 5 mg PO daily until ___, 2.5 mg 
starting ___ through ___, then stop prednisone. 
Re-evaluate need if symptoms worsen off of prednisone. 

Code: Full, confirmed w/ Son (___), Proxy ___

This patient was prescribed, or continued on, an opioid pain 
medication at the time of discharge (please see the attached 
medication list for details). As part of our safe opioid 
prescribing process, all patients are provided with an opioid 
risks and treatment resource education sheet and encouraged to 
discuss this therapy with their outpatient providers to 
determine if opioid pain medication is still indicated.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ female with advanced ___, 
chronic respiratory failure s/p trach, chronic aspiration with 
PEG, dementia, hypertension, hyperlipidemia who is presenting 
with distal fibula (?tibial as well) fracture and found to have 
concerns for UTI in the ED. She was admitted to the ICU given 
chronic respiratory failure and brief hypotension in the ED 
which responded to IVF.

#Comminuted distal fibula fracture
Presenting with distal fibula fracture after having trauma on
stationary bike. She was initially placed in a right lower 
extremity splint, which was subsequently casted by the 
orthopedics service. She received her home acetaminophen dose 
and oxycodone as needed for pain control. She has follow-up 
scheduled with orthopedics. 

#Hypotension, improved
Patient was briefly hypotensive in the ED with SBPs in the ___, 
Improved with 1L NS. Lactate within normal limits. Etiology 
likely either hypovolemia vs. sepsis. Given hyponatremia, 
possibly related to hypovolemia, especially given rapid 
improvement after small amount of IVF. Some concerns for UTI as 
noted below. 

#UTI
Patient found to have pyuria on UA in setting of leukocytosis. 
No other clear source of infection. She was given a 7 day course 
of ceftriaxone as treatment for urinary tract infection which 
was then transitioned to Keflex. 

#Chronic respiratory failure 
Respiratory status appears at baseline, patient has a 
tracheostomy. CXR without evidence of consolidation. Home 
settings on trach were continued with trach mask during the day 
and ventilator at night, and her home medications were 
continued. 

___: Her home carbidopa/levodopa regimen was continued. 
She had some episodes of agitation overnight and her outpatient 
neurologist Dr. ___ was consulted, who recommended an 
additional 1.5 tabs of Sinamet as needed at 3 am for agitation. 
This was noted to improve her agitation overnight. 

#Bradycardia: While in the ICU, the patient had intermittent 
episodes of sinus bradycardia overnight in the setting of being 
off the ventilator and while episodes of agitation. EKG showed 
no evidence of bundle branch block or heart block. This was 
thought to be secondary to the vasovagal episodes given timing 
with episodes of agitation as well as being off the ventilator. 
She did not have any hypotension during these episodes and 
continued to be monitored throughout her stay.  Her son, ___, 
expressed interest in a cardiology evaluation for which we 
provided him the contact information to schedule an outpatient 
appointment as her bradycardia resolved with improvement in 
agitation and pain control.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY
=======
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with chronic respiratory 
failure s/p tracheostomy ___ (nocturnally ventilated), chronic 
aspiration s/p PEG, dementia, advanced ___, HTN, 
hyperlipidemia, recent admission for a right fibula fracture, 
and other issues who presented on ___ with apparent 
lethargy (reported by her son, as the patient is variably 
interactive) in the setting of a reported right lower lobe 
pneumonia apparently noted on outpatient imaging on the day 
prior to presentation. On repeat imaging on presentation to 
___, there were no definite signs of pneumonia and there were 
no clinical indications of acute systemic inflammation or 
infection. She remained on her home ventilator settings at night 
and trach mask during the day. Although very broad spectrum 
antibiotics were provided on presentation in the ED, given the 
absence of infection on chest imaging and the lack of clinical 
symptoms of an acute infection, all antibiotics were stopped 
upon ICU admission, and she was monitored off of antibiotics for 
24 hours without any signs of clinical instability. She was 
subsequently discharged home without antibiotics.

ACUTE ISSUES 
============
# Concern for right upper lobe pneumonia (without radiographic 
or clinical evidence of right upper lobe pneumonia) 
# Chronic respiratory failure 
Ms. ___ has a tracheostomy tube in place in the setting of 
chronic respiratory failure, and requires ventilator support at 
night. During the day, she uses a humidifier with 3L of 
supplemental oxygen. Per history provided by her son (who is her 
primary caregiver at home), Ms. ___ has had increased 
secretions over the last week and an out-patient chest x-ray on 
___ was concerning for potential right upper lobe pneumonia. 
However, on presentation to ___, there was no compelling 
radiographic or clinical evidence of pneumonia. Blood cultures 
and a MRSA screen were negative. She specifically had minimal 
secretions on tracheal suctioning, no leukocytosis on her 
complete blood counts, no fever, no hypotension, no tachycardia, 
and no radiographic evidence of pneumonia (although her lung 
apices were not well visualized on chest x-ray to 
kyphoscoliosis). Ms. ___ was continued on her home 
ipratropium and levalbuterol nebuliizer treatemetns, and 
fomoterol(home med). Her ventilator settings should remain at RR 
___, PEEP 5, TV 300 (reduced from 400cc at home, given her 
height and predicted tidal volume), and FiO2 30%

# History of UTIs
In the ED, the patient did not urinate but on the floor she has 
been incontinent of urine. She has a history of UTIs, and during 
a recent prior hospitalizations, on ___ she grew Klebsiella 
and was appropriately treated. She had another UTI while at home 
prior to this hospitalization which was treated empirically with 
cephalexin and then switched to Bactrim. Urinalysis here ___ 
was without evidence of acute cystitis, and while there was 
initial concern for urinary retention she began to void 
spontaneously prior to discharge, and did not have any more 
issues with retention while inpatient.

# ___ disease 
# Dementia
During her last admission, Ms. ___ had some episodes of 
agitation overnight and her outpatient neurologist Dr. ___ 
___ was consulted. At that time, he recommended an additional 
1.5 tabs of Sinamet as needed at 3AM for agitation. During that 
prior hospitalization, this medication change was noted to 
improve her agitation overnight. Her son says that she 
communicates with him, is normally oriented to person and place, 
and can speak with Passy-Muir valve. We continued Sinamet at her 
home doses this admission.

CHRONIC ISSUES 
==============
#B/l UE catheter associated DVT
She had bilateral upper extremity DVTs diagnosed in ___, 
with repeat US in ___ showing no evidence of DVT. Now that she 
has been treated for more than six months, she remains on 
enoxaparin prophylaxis, which we continued during this 
hospitalization (and on discharge). 

#Hypothyroidism: We continued her home levothyroxine. 

#Esophageal dysmotility: s/p PEG: We continued the Nutrition 
service's final tube feed recommendations from her last 
admission. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[] Follow up on respiratory secretions and respiratory status 
off of antibiotics
[] Continue to monitor for signs of urinary retention, consider 
outpatient urodynamic studies if persistently retaining.
[] Ventilator settings at discharge: RR 13, TV 300, PEEP 5, FiO2

IMAGING
========
___ CXR
Evaluation is limited due to low lung volumes and patient 
positioning with chin overlying the lung apices. Within these 
limitations: 
Tracheostomy is again seen. No large pleural effusion or obvious 
pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged and 
stable. Aortic arch atherosclerotic calcifications are again 
seen.  Obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm may be secondary to 
atelectasis, a developing infiltrate cannot be excluded. 
The apparent opacity in the right lower lung base is not 
visualized on repeat images and is likely due to overlying soft 
tissue, possibly the patient's arm. Deformities of the bilateral 
ribs, may be related to old fractures.

===================
___ year old woman with chronic respiratory failure s/p PEG/trach 
___ (nocturnally ventilated), chronic aspiration with PEG, 
dementia, advanced ___, HTN, HLD, and recent admission 
for a right fibula fracture, who presents with hypotension and 
diarrhea in the setting of C diff infection and UTI. Her 
hypotension was likely hypovolemic and rapidly improved with IV 
fluid resuscitation. She was treated with high-dose PO 
vancomycin and IV flagyl as well as IV ceftriaxone for her GNR 
UTI. Upon discharge, the patient was clinically improved with 
baseline blood pressures and decreased stool output.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
====================
[] Patient to complete PO vancomycin on ___ for total course 
of 14 days. Please ensure diarrhea has resolved following 
completion of this
[] Patient initiated on treatment for UTI and will be discharged 
with bactrim for 1 day for total 3 day course. Please ensure 
completion and resolution of UTI following this
[] Would recommend prophylactic PO vancomycin with future 
antibiotic courses to prevent recurrent C. diff

ACUTE ISSUES 
======================= 
# Diarrhea
# C difficile Infection
Patient presented with diarrhea over the past week unresponsive 
to PO vanc in the setting of known C diff infection. Although 
the number of daily stools has slowed down, the volume of the 
stools have been large. Given that she has had multiple c diff 
infections, she may be resistant to vancomycin. Stool cultures 
were sent. She was started on high dose PO vancomycin and IV 
flagyl. She was given IV fluids as below for GI losses. Her 
stool output decreased, her hypotension resolves, and she 
overall clinically was stable.

# Hypotension
Patient has blood pressures as low as ___ systolic in ED. BP was 
very responsive to fluid with no need for pressors. This was 
likely due to hypovolemia in the setting of fluid loss from 
diarrhea. Possibly, a compenent of SIRS response with C diff 
infection and UTI. No evidence of end organ damage based on 
initial labs. Blood pressures on discharge back to baseline.

# UTI
Patient with urine culture growing >100K GNR bacteria. The team 
was unable to assess symptoms given her mental status. 
Therefore, given concern for sepsis, she was treated with IV 
ceftriaxone.

# Chronic respiratory failure 
Patient has a tracheostomy and requires ventilator support at 
night. Patient has a history of frequent aspirations, with CXR 
appearing similar to baseline. She was continued on home 
ventilator settings. she was continued on home ipratropium, 
levalbuterol, and Perforomist. 

CHRONIC ISSUES

Followed by her outpatient neurologist Dr. ___. 
Patient continued on home Sinamet.

#B/l UE catheter associated DVT
Diagnosed in ___, with repeat US in ___ showing no 
evidence of DVT. Now that she has been treated for more than six 
months, enoxaparin is for DVT ppx. She was continued on

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for occasional wheezing and cough. There was 
concern for pneumonia but your chest X-ray did not show 
pneumonia and your symptoms quickly improved with nebulizers. 
Antibiotics were stopped and you tolerated this just fine. 
Overall, your presentation is most consistent with a post 
infectious bronchitis or asthma like syndrome.

You were evaluated by speech and language pathology who felt you 
would benefit from a ground diet with thin liquids to minimize 
your risks of accidentally inhaling some of your food when you 
eat (which can predispose to pneumonia and coughing fits).

You were deconditioned and had difficulty moving around and 
physical therapy recommended going to a rehab facility. You did 
not qualify for acute level rehab and so you and your family 
elected to go home with maximal services in order to work on 
getting stronger at home.

___ strength in UE and LUE. Labs were notable for H/H 11.2/33.7, 
PTT 72.5, INR 1.1, Na 130, cl 95 Cr 0.7. 

The patient underwent extensive imaging in the ED. CT C spine 
was negative for acute fracture or hemorrhage. CT Head was 
negative for acute intracranial pathology. Pelvis XR, B/L Knee 
XR, L ankle XR negative for fracture. Initial CXR negative for 
acute intrathoracic pathology. 

While in the ED, the patient began to have labored respiration 
requiring O2 by NC. Per son had similar jerking movements with 
startling. Concern for aspiration as labored respriations 
occurred after patient eating meds with applesauce. Repeat CXR 
was stable. She was treated with NS and nebulizers. Her 
pressures were in the low ___ while sleeping, but after 
nebulizer treatment and sitting up her pressures were in the 
100s/70s. VBG 7.41/43/49/28, and lactate 1.8

Overall the patient received 500 ml NS, ipatroprium bromide neb

IMAGING/STUDIES
====================
ECGStudy Date of ___  11:41:42 AM 
Clinical indication for EKG: R00.0 - Tachycardia 

Sinus tachycardia. First degree ___ block. Early precordial R 
wave
progression. Low voltage iin the precordial leads. Compared to 
the previoustracing of ___ tachcyardia is now present. Low 
voltage in the precordialleads is now present.

CT C Spine WO Contrast ___
1. No acute fracture identified. 
2. Severe cervical spondylosis with mild anterolisthesis of C2 
on C3 and C7 on 
T1.  Mild to moderate central canal narrowing without ___ 
stenosis. 
3. Anterior compression deformity of the T3 vertebral body is 
unchanged. 

CT Head ___
No acute intracranial abnormality. 

ANKLE (AP, MORTISE & LAT) LEFT  ___ 
No fracture.  Marked generalized demineralization.
 
PELVIS (AP ONLY)  ___
No fracture identified.  Marked generalized demineralization

KNEE (AP, LAT AND OBLIQUE) BILATERAL  ___  
No fracture.  Prominent osteoporosis 

CHEST (SINGLE VIEW)  ___
No acute intrathoracic abnormality.  Consider dedicated spine 
imaging if there is clinical concern for thoracic spinal 
fracture.
 
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) ___
Overall stable examination of the chest.

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW  ___spiration.

CHEST (PA & LAT) ___
The aorta is markedly unfolded and tortuous.  Heart remains 
upper limits of normal in size.  There is bilateral interstitial 
prominence which is not significantly changed since ___ and likely reflects underlying interstitial lung disease 
rather than interstitial edema.  The patient's mandible obscures 
the apices.  No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  No focal 
airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is an ___ year old woman with a history of 
___ disease, bilateral blindness, HTN, presenting after 
a fall and head strike without LOC at home, admitted with 
respiratory distress and hypoxia in the ED with rapid 
resolution. 

# Mechanical Fall:
Patient discharged on the same day as re presentation to the ED. 
On previous admission, patient noted by ___ to be at high fall 
risk and recommended acute rehab however son declined as pt not 
accepted to first choice rehab. Patient admitted after fall from 
chair, most likely mechanical in etiology, as he patient was 
startled and slipped to the ground and in the setting of her 
weakness and ___ was unable to stop he fall. There was 
no loss of consciousness to suggest syncope as the etiology.  
Overall picture not consistent with seizure activity, as there 
was no post ictal period, also no elevation in lactate noted on 
labs, and the patient ambulated after the event with the use of 
a walker. Imaging including CT C spine, CT Head, CXR, Pelvis XR, 
bilateral knee XR and L ankle XR without fracture or acute 
pathology. There were no focal neuro signs on exam. ___ was 
consulted who recommended disposition to rehab. She was 
discharged to ___.

# Respiratory distress/Aspiration
While in the ED the patient developed respiratory 
distress/labored respirations requiring NC. The etiology was 
concerning for aspiration as she had been eating her medications 
with applesauce prior to the event. A repeat CXR in the ED was 
negative for aspiration, but may have been premature to 
visualize any changes. The differential also included airway 
reactivity, given the recent admission for reactive airways. She 
was quickly weaned to room air with nebulizer treatments. Given 
the concern for mild respiratory distress a third CXR was done 
on the floor, again without any signs of infiltrate or acute 
pathology. There was evidence of mild volume overload and pt 
received 10mg IV lasix. On the previous admission the patient 
was evaluated by SLP who recommended a diet of ground solids and 
thin liquids. SLP was re consulted this admission, and the 
patient underwent a video swallow due to concerns for bedside 
aspiration, which revealed penetration and trace aspiration, and 
the patient was initiated on a diet of ground solids and nectar 
thickened liquids. She was also seen by nutrition who 
recommended supplementation with ensure plus TID. She was 
continued on atrovent and albuterol nebulizer treatmens, and 
fluticasone inhaler. Of note, albuterol was used cautiously as 
caused pt to become tachycardiac.

# Hyponatremia - RESOLVED
Patient with new mild hyponatremia to 130, with concomitant 
hypochloremia. Likely secondary to hypovolemia given improvement 
with IVF. 
 
# Coagulopathy Elevated PTT - RESOLVED
Patient with newly elevated PTT on admission. On recent 
admission patient appears to have been on heparin 5000 U TID, 
though patient is of normal BMI, likely the etioloy of the 
elevated PTT. No concomitant elevation in INR, no 
thrombocytopenia to suggest DIC. No history of elevated PTT in 
the past to suggest the presence of an acquired or intrinsic 
inhibitor. Resolved with holding subC heparin. The patient was 
restarted on subC heparin for VTE prophylaxis with BID dosing 
without elevation in PTT

CHRONIC ISSUES
===============
# ___ disease: Stable. The patient was continued on home 
rasagiline, ___ and carbidopa dosing.

# Hypertension: Stable. The patient continued home metoprolol 
succinate 12.5 mg daily.

# Hyperlipidemia: Stable. The patient continued home 
atorvastatin.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

It was a pleasure caring for you during your stay at ___. You 
were admitted to the hospital after a fall at home. Imaging of 
your head, neck, chest, pelvis, knees and ankle did not reveal 
any signs of fracture or bleeding. In the ED you had some 
shortness of breath and were admitted to the hospital. Your 
breathing improved rapidly with breathing treatments, and you 
were feeling much better by discharge. You had chest x rays 
which did not show any infection or fluid in your lungs. 

You had a video swallow study done, and the speech and language 
pathology experts recommended that you continue on a diet of 
ground foods and nectar thickened liquids to help prevent 
inhaling food when you eat (which can predispose you to 
infection)

You were evaluated by physical therapy and there were signs that 
you were deconditioned and had difficulty moving. They 
recommended that you go to a rehab facility.

Your updated medication list is included in your discharge 
paperwork. You will need to follow up with your primary care 
doctor within 1 week of discharge.

We Wish You The Best!

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old single Caucasian man with reported history 
of depression s/p one psychiatric hospitalization in ___ ___ for depression and suicidal ideation, 
history of intermittent cannabis use, who presented to ___ via 
EMS after his roommates were concerned for several hours of 
bizarre behaviors. ED course was notable for agitation with 
patient requiring mechanical and chemical restraints. 
. 
Initial presentation was concerning for severe psychosis with 
apparent acute onset (per collateral was seen by his parents 
about a week prior to presentation and appeared to be at his 
baseline) with ED course notable for grandiosity, irritability,
disorganized and tangential thought process, as well as 
agitation requiring numerous physical and chemical restraints. 
Interview on my examination was significantly more reassuring, 
with patient notably calm, cooperative with thought process that 
is linear, goal and future oriented. Of note, he denies AVH and 
he does not appear to be responding to internal stimuli. 
. 
In terms of etiology, presentation seems most consistent with 
substance induced psychosis, although the patient denies recent 
illicit substance use and his tox screen was negative on 
admission. Differential also includes brief psychotic disorder, 
bipolar disorder (although no clear history of mania in the 
past-- remains on the differential given young age with ?family 
history of bipolar). Has reportedly been depressed in the past, 
but denies depressive symptoms on examination and does not 
appear dysthymic or dysphoric on examination.  
. 
#. Legal/Safety: patient admitted to Deaconess ___ on a ___, upon admission, he declined to sign a CV, stating he wished 
to be discharged home. Patient maintained his safety throughout 
his hospitalization on 15 minute checks and did not require 
physical or chemical restraints. Given his good behavioral 
control with resolution of psychotic symptoms with consistent 
denial of SI/HI, he did not meet 7&8b criteria and was 
discharged upon expiration of his ___. 
.
#. Psychosis: as noted above
- Patient declined initiation of psychotropic medications during 
his hospitalization. He was offered prn Ativan, which he did not 
require. 
- Mr. ___ maintained excellent behavioral control in the 
milieu and was compliant in attending groups, where he 
participated appropriately 
- Of note, during his hospitalization, his psychosis cleared 
rapidly with thought process that became linear, logical, goal 
and future oriented. He was calm, cooperative on examination 
with full range of affect, consistently denying AVH with no 
evidence that he was responding to internal stimuli. 
- Patient was counseled to avoid using illicit drugs, including 
cannabis, as this may increase his risk for a recurrent episode 
of psychosis. The patient understood this risk and stated he 
would abstain. 
- Patient declined referral to a PHP and will follow up with 
outpatient treaters as noted in the discharge worksheet.

(Extended Release) 60 mg PO QHS) as well given stable BPs. 
Started spironolactone ___ after drawing ___ labs. 
Recommend calibrating home BP cuff to office 

# Coronary Artery Disease:
Stable. No evidence of acute ischemia, no chest pain, troponin 
is negative. Continued ASA 81mg. Switched Simvastatin 80mg PO 
QPM to atorva 40 given interaction with amlodipine. Trops 
negative x2. Consider stress test as outpatient given new 
regional wall motion abnormality on echo. 

# Diabetes Mellitus Type II: Concern for hypoglycemia. A1c of 
6.3%. Decreased home 70/30 due to hypoglycemia fasting, held 
home liraglutide. Diabetic/heart healthy diet. 

# Hyperlipidemia:
Stable. Continued simvastatin 

=============================
 TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
=============================
- Please follow up angiotensin renin ratio (ordered prior to 
starting spironolactone)

atorvastatin given interaction with amlodipine. 
- Started spironolactone
- Increased torsemide to 40qday
- Switched beta blocker to carvedilol 
- Please recheck electrolytes in 1 week given diuretic changes
- Decreased home insulin and held home liraglutide given 
inpatient lows on home insulin regimen. Please titrate diabetic 
medications. 
- Recommend stress mibi as outpatient given new regional wall 
motion abnormality on echo
- Recommend re-addressing goals of care. Patient is full code 
for now but would like to think about it. 
- Recommend calibration of home BP cuff with office 
measurements.
- Discharged on 4 days of cefpodoxime for UTI. Please follow up 
culture.

with
acute onset dizziness/vertigo. 

Awoke at 4AM feeling okay. Went to BR, then on way back to bed
acute onset vertigo (horizontal room spinning, unclear which
direction), sat down. Took a drink of water and became 
nauseated,
had several episodes of NBNB emesis. Lay down and vertigo
resolved. Daughters called ___. In ambulance sitting up, again
with vertigo, asked EMS to have her lie down which they did,
vertigo improved somewhat but did not resolve. Persisted 
somewhat
improved into waiting room for ER and triage, then resolved.
Sitting semi-reclined patient denies ongoing vertigo but thinks
if she sits up will have it again. Reports that she is unsure if
lasted more than two minutes each time as she was unable to
tolerate sitting up long enough to see if it would resolve. 

Denies loss of vision, vision changes, blacking out, LOC,
headaches, numbness, weakness, difficulty thinking or speaking,
confusion. Denies congestion but reports having the ""flu""/URI 
two
weeks ago, then developing the shortness of breath/CHF
exacerbation and UTI (reports no urinary or abdominal symptoms
with the UTI). 

Had multiple medication changes during her recent admission,
outlined below, notably with changes in antihypertensives and
addition of spironolactone and increase of torsemide (currently
on extensive antihypertensive regimen including isosorbide,
carvedilol, spironolactone, irbesartan, amlodipine, torsemide)
after felt that she had primary hyperaldosteronism (renin and
aldosterone still pending).  

She has permanent AF on Xarelto. She has not been off
anticoagulation since ___ when she had her thymectomy
and denies missed doses of medication. 

In ED for ED physicians per report NIHSS 0, HINTS testing no
corrective saccade, no skew.

# Pyelonephritis with sepsis: Patient presented with several 
days of urinary sx's, UA w/ many WBCs, bacteria, and RBCs, CVA 
tenderness on exam, and febrile all consistent with 
pyelonephritis. No other localizing symptoms to suggest other 
source for infection. She has had ___ UTIs in past, grown 
ampicillin-sensitive enterococcus, klebsiella, and E.coli, but 
nothing that was multi-drug resistant. Renal ultrasound obtained 
was negative for hydronephrosis or abscess. She received a dose 
of IV Ceftriaxone in the ED then started on vancomycin and 
cefepime for empiric coverage in the ICU.  She was transitioned 
to PO Ciprofloxacin as Urine culture grew Pan-sensitive E coli 
with plans to complete a 10 day course through ___.

# Atrial Fibrillation: EKGs all demonstrated sinus rhythm, 
however she has a hx of AF and her heart rates were as high as 
130 in the ED. Her heart rates improved with IVF. Home Coreg and 
rivaroxaban continued.

# Hypertension, Mild hypernatremia, Hypokalemia, primary 
hyperaldosteronism: Patient was started on spironolactone for 
hyperaldosteronism that was recently discontinued in ___ for 
hyperkalemia.  Since that time her blood pressure and 
electrolytes were controlled on torsemide, carvediolol, 
amlodipine, and irbesartan. On admission her some of her 
antihypertensives including torsemide were held as a precaution 
in the setting of infection/sepsis.  These were resumed with 
recovery of blood pressure.  Sodium was noted to be 148 two days 
in a row after sepsis physiology had resolved despite good PO 
intake. The patient described polyuria and polydipsia but 
appeared euvolemic on exam and felt that hypernatremia was most 
likely due to hyperaldosteronism. She was restarted on low dose 
spironolactone with plan for close outpatient monitoring for 
development of hyperkalemia. 

# DMII: Home 70/30 regimen was continued and Victoza resumed at 
discharge.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ woman with multiple vascular risk factors, including 
prior stroke, atrial fibrillation on River Oxilan and aspirin, 
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, insulin-dependent diabetes 
mellitus, who initially presented with persistent vertigo.  She 
reported a positional vertigo that did not dissipate initially 
on rest.  ED evaluation was notable for hyperglycemia to 430.  
She reported some recent changes with her diabetes medications, 
followed usually by her primary care.  There were no neighboring 
signs or symptoms, or additional review of system features 
suggestive of a peripheral vestibulopathy, such as neuronitis, 
or Ménière's disease,.  Her exam was not suggestive of central 
vertigo, though given her risk factors, she was admitted for 
stroke workup.  Her CTA was unremarkable.  MRI did not reveal 
any stroke, but did show an evolution of white matter disease in 
the periventricular areas.  Therefore, the most likely etiology 
of her symptoms was felt to be hyperglycemia causing 
vertigo-like symptoms, versus benign paroxysmal positional 
vertigo.  Her vertigo-like symptoms dissipated overnight into 
the next morning after admission.  Her blood sugars were better 
controlled while admitted, though her A1c was 12.7 reflecting 
likely poorly controlled diabetes as an outpatient. She 
indicated a desire to follow-up with her primary care provider, 
but as well as the ___ further 
management.  She was advised to stay hydrated to avoid the 
effect of glucose related diuresis.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

Your admitted to the hospital for vertigo, or a room spinning 
sensation.  Sometimes, vertigo is caused by stroke in part of 
the brain, so you are admitted for close monitoring and further 
workup.  Thankfully, your MRI did not show any strokes.  You 
felt better the next day in terms of vertigo, and you were able 
to walk around the hospital without any issues.  The most likely 
explanation for your symptoms therefore is something called 
benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, which can occur when the 
inner ear has problems with debris that builds up over time.  
The other possibility is your elevated blood sugars, which can 
certainly cause dizziness that may mimic vertigo.  In addition, 
the sugar in your blood can act as a diuretic medicine, removing 
more fluid than you are able to make up for by drinking.  This 
may lead to additional lightheadedness and feelings of dizziness 
which may have contributed to her symptoms.  If this happens 
again, you may be referred either to a neurologist or ___ 
rehab to help you with the symptoms, during which they may 
perform certain maneuvers to clear the debris from your year.  
Please contact your primary care provider if the symptoms recur. 
 However, if the symptoms persist, or are accompanied by changes 
in vision, including double vision, or weakness or sensation 
changes, please report to the nearest emergency department as 
they may reflect stroke.  Otherwise, please continue all of your 
medications as directed and do not miss doses.

It was a pleasure taking care of you.

PERTINENT STUDIES
===================
TTE ___

CONCLUSION:
The left atrial volume index is moderately increased. The right 
atrium is moderately enlarged. There is no,evidence for an 
atrial septal defect by 2D/color Doppler. The estimated right 
atrial pressure is ___ mmHg.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with a 
normal cavity size. There is moderate global left ventricular 
hypokinesis and relative preservation of apical function. There 
is beat-to-beat variability in the left ventricular 
contractility due to the irregular rhythm. Quantitative 3D 
volumetric left ventricular ejection fraction is 36 % (normal 
54-73%). There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract 
gradient. No ventricular septal defect is seen. Tissue Doppler 
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP 
greater than 18 mmHg). There is Grade III diastolic dysfunction. 
Normal right ventricular cavity size with low normal free wall 
motion. The aortic sinus diameter is normal for gender with 
normal ascending aorta diameter for gender. The aortic arch 
diameter is normal. There is no evidence for an aortic arch 
coarctation. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally 
normal. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is no aortic 
regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with no mitral 
valve prolapse. The transmitral E-wave deceleration time is 
short (less than 140ms) c/w restrictive filling. There is 
moderate [2+] mitral regurgitation. The pulmonic valve leaflets 
are not well seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear 
structurally normal. There is moderate [2+] tricuspid 
regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
normal cavity size and moderate global systolic dysfunction c/w 
a nonischemic process in the setting of beat to beat variability 
in systolic function. Increased PCWP. Grade III/IV diastolic 
dysfunction. Restrictive
filling pattern. Normal right ventricular cavity size and 
low-normal systolic function. Moderate mitral regurgitation. 
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension.
Compared with the prior TTE ___, the findings are 
similar.

TEE CARDIOVERSION ___
CONCLUSION:
There is no spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the body of 
the left atrium/left atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage 
ejection velocity is mildly depressed. No spontaneous echo 
contrast or thrombus is seen
in the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage. The 
right atrial appendage ejection velocity is normal. There is no 
evidence for an atrial septal defect by 2D/color Doppler. 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately 
depressed. There are no aortic arch atheroma with no atheroma in 
the descending aorta to 30 cm from the incisors. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal. No masses or 
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No abscess is seen. 
There is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened with no mitral valve prolapse. No masses or 
vegetations are seen on the mitral valve. No abscess is seen. 
There is a central jet of moderate [2+] mitral regurgitation. 
The tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal. No 
mass/vegetation are seen on the tricuspid valve. No abscess is 
seen. There is mild [1+] tricuspid regurgitation. The estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is borderline elevated.
IMPRESSION: No intracardiac thrombus seen. Moderate left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction. Moderate mitral regurgitation.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY STATEMENT:
====================
___ female with a history of NICM (EF 40% in ___,
AF on xarelto, CKD stage IIIb, h/o stroke ___ no
residual deficits, DMII, HTN, who presents with 4 days of
dyspnea, found to have elevated BNP and pulmonary congestion on
CXR, admitted for heart failure exacerbation with new afib 
likely a contributing factor, improved with diuresis and 
successfully TEE cardioversion into sinus rhythm on ___.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[] Restart amlodipine on follow up per outpatient provider. 
Blood pressure as inpatient was managed with Carvedilol which 
may not be sufficient as monotherapy
[] Restarted torsemide 40 PO on discharge, assess for fluid 
status on follow-up
[] Repeat echo if continues to be in sinus rhythm. If she 
continues to have low EF, consider guideline directed medical 
therapy.
[] Follow up is being scheduled with her cardiologist within 2 
weeks
[] Consider discontinuation of aspirin depending on whether she 
has a indication for it
[] Insulin regimen reduced to 30u in AM and 20u in ___ of 70-30 
(in addition to liraglutide) due to relative hypoglycemia while 
inpatient, please titrate per outpatient provider
[] Switched from rivaroxaban to apixaban due to chronic kidney 
disease.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
==============
# Acute on Chronic HFrEF:
# NICM: 
Presentation is c/w subacute onset of HF exacerbation thought 
___
afib and dietary changes in the last week, with wt gain, 
elevated
BNP and JVP. She likely also had a flash pulmonary edema which
caused the acute worsening the morning of presentation, which
quickly resolved with bipap. She diuresed well with IV Lasix and 
on discharge resumed torsemide 40 daily. It is thought her 
atrial fibrillation was actually new which triggered her HF 
exacerbation. She had an echo showing newly reduced EF of 36%, 
but it is thought this may be secondary to tachycardiac mediated 
cardiomyopathy.

#?New AF with rapid rates on arrival: 
The patient has a chad2vasc of 7. Despite chart diagnosis of 
pAF, no objective evidence in Atris or Partners charts of atrial 
fibrillation (she had some EKGs with NSR and frequent PACs), so 
we treated this is new atrial fibrillation. Nonetheless came in 
on rivaroxaban which she had taken for several years and was 
switched to apixaban in the setting of CKD. She does have a 
remote history of taking Pradaxa as far back as ___. Seems she 
switched to rivaroxaban ___. It is thought her new Afib 
contributed to her heart failure. She underwent successful TEE 
cardioversion (no ___ clot) with 360 J shock on ___ 
(unsuccessful 200J shock). She was discharged on carvedilol 50 
mg twice daily and rivaroxaban was switched to apixaban due to 
concern for kidney function.

#Transaminitis
Likely ___ hepatic congestion iso CHF exacerbation, downtrended 
with diuresis.

# T2DM on insulin: she reported some low blood sugars to ___ at
home, on liraglutide and 70/30 at home 36U AM 44U ___. Decreased 
to 30 AM 20 in ___ due to low sugars here.

# CKD stage IIIb: Cr 1.3 on admission, baseline is 1.0, may be
cardiorenal, improved on discharge.

# History of CVA
# Non-obstructive CAD in ___, negative pMIBI in ___: 
- continued ASA
- continued BB as above 
- continued statin

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___.

WHY WAS I ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL?
- You were admitted to the hospital because of shortness of 
breath and an irregular heartbeat.

WHAT HAPPENED WHILE I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL?
- In the hospital, we performed some lab tests to determine the 
reason for your shortness of breath. We also performed 
measurements of the electrical activity of your heart, which 
showed that it was beating in an irregular rhythm. We gave you a 
pill that would reduce the amount of water your body held onto 
as well as medications to decrease the resistance against which 
your heart pumped. These medications also decrease your 
heartrate. We also performed some imaging to look at your heart. 
Because your heartbeat was so fast and irregular, it wasn't 
pumping blood efficiently. The medications helped with this, but 
you required an electrical shock to convert your heart back into 
regular rhythm. We are glad you are feeling better after these 
procedures.

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME?
- Please take all of your medications exactly as prescribed and 
attend all of your follow-up appointments listed below.
- It is particularly important that you do NOT miss ___ dose of 
your apixaban.

We wish you the best!
Your ___ Care Team

[] Patient should have follow up with PCP in the next 7 days to 
reevaluate knee after cessation of antibiotics and diarrhea

ACUTE ISSUES ADDRESSED
=======================
# Fever 
# Abdominal pain 
# Presumed C. diff colitis 
Patient presented with fever and abdominal pain. He was recently 
started on PO vanc for presumed C. diff colitis. He continued to 
have diarrhea but remained afebrile, without leukocytosis, and 
with improving abdominal pain. Stool tests sent were remarkable 
for negative C. diff PCR, negative bacterial stool cultures. 
Decreased PO vancomycin to prophylactic dosing of 125mg BID. At 
time of discharge fever and abdominal pain had resolved, but 
patient did have ongoing loose bowel movements ___ daily 
without clear etiology. Suspect antibiotic associated/non 
infectious given that he was clinically well appearing 
otherwise. 

# R knee septic arthritis 
Patient had a R quad tendon rupture s/p quad tendon repair with 
course c/b sepsis c/f post op infection s/p R knee washout and 
debridement on ___. No growth from the OR cultures, but was 
started on a 4 week course of vanc/ceftriaxone (scheduled to end 
___ due to significant amount of polys and purulence noted 
during washout. Per OMR review, his knee was without erythema or 
purulence at his OPAT visit on ___. On exam on day of 
admission, patient's knee is very warm, erythematous, and tender 
to light touch, and CRP remains elevated at 95.8, which is 
concerning for a possible septic joint. ID was consulted and 
recommended joint aspiration initially, though with improvement 
in knee exam, aspiration and I&D were deferred. Continued IV 
vancomycin and ceftriaxone until ___. Patient was discharged 
off of antibiotics with plan for outpatient monitoring. 

# Hypokalemia 
# Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis 
# Hypovolemia ___ to Diarrhea 
Likely ___ GI losses, improved with IVF resuscitation and 
potassium repletion. 

# Acute on chronic normocytic anemia 
His current Hgb level is 9.5, slightly down from yesterday. 
Likely in the context of infection. Iron studies showed iron 
deficiency. Can start outpatient iron supplementation.

History of Present Illness:
HPI: History obtained with assistance from ___ interpreter. 

Ms. ___ is a ___ yo woman with PMH of HTN/HLD presenting with
left neck pain and generalized weakness. 

She was recently discharged from ___ after an admission for a
viral illness which causes nausea and vomiting but has had
persistent weakness and anorexia. She denies fevers/chills,
n/v/d/abd pain, urinary sx, cp/SOB/cough, but says she has had
minimal appetite for weeks and has been constipated for a few
days. She notes that she does not feel at all confused at this
time but did have some confusion after her last admission. She
states that sometimes when walking she feels generally weak with
some dizziness and a feeling of numbness in her legs. 

Her primary complaint today is anterior left neck pain x3 days
which is sometimes associated with weakness in her left arm. 
She says that the neck pain started about one week ago and is in
able to point to a precipitating factor like exercise, lifting
heavy things, etc. She denies headaches, vision changes, or 
other
associated sx. She reports that she came into the hospital
instead of going to her PCP for this because she thought it was
severe enough to go to the hospital and because her family was
worried about her, especially since she has lost weight over the
last month. She thinks she lost weight because of the impact her
recent viral illness had on PO intake. 

Per report, the patient has been persistently failing at home
leading to repeated hospital admissions despite having a ___.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo woman with PMH of HTN/HLD presenting with left neck pain 
and generalized weakness.      

#Neck pain: One week of neck pain without clear etiology as no
clear precipitating factors. Patient had recent viral illness 
but
denies f/c, n/v, headache, vision changes, other neurologic
changes which would be concerning for meningitis so no need for
LP. Pain is focal on left side of neck without
notable exam findings. Pt reports intermittent arm weakness but
neurological exam completely intact, Spurling test negative, no
point tenderness over spine or signs of spinal injury. No bruit
or thrill no raise concern for vascular abnormality, no mass or
lymphadenopathy to raise concern for infection. XR and CT of 
C-spine show severe cervical DJD as well as calcification of 
carotids R>L. Pain improved with ibuprofen and home tramadol on 
which she was discharged, may benefit from longstanding tx with 
COX-2 inhibitor as allergic to APAP. 

#Weakness/anorexia/gait abnormality: Exam relatively 
unremarkable, patient mentating well, but appears to
be failing at home based on multiple recent admissions. Poor PO
intake appears to be slow recovery from recent viral illness, 
but
could be part of overall subacute decline. Continued on home 
mirtazapine. Evaluated by nutrition who felt that patient has 
good diet but would benefit from Ensure supplementation. 
Evaluated by ___ who cleared patient for home without additional 
services. In conversation with patient, daughter, and social 
work, team able to get collateral information that patient has 
numerous services at home through elder services and daughter is 
considering applying for assisted living but has been anxious 
about mother's ability to function at home. Overall, patient is 
largely healthy, cognitive intact, and safe to ambulate on her 
own. Will benefit from maximal services available from elder 
services but is largely functioning well with good supports. 

#HTN: EKG with LBBB and LVH, exam notable for S4 making some end
organ damage from longstanding hypertension likely. Chem 7 wnl. 
Stable on home losartan. 
 Will follow up with PCP regarding HTN management, consideration 
of TTE, and ophthalmology f/u given evidence of end organ 
damage. 

#GERD: Stable on home omeprazole

#Anemia: Hgb 10.3->9.4 with unclear baseline. Likely ___ 
dilution as all cell lines down. Patient on home iron 
supplementation and aware of anemia. Will need ongoing 
outpatient monitoring, discharged with home iron 
supplementation. 

Transitional issues:
-Found to have extensive DJD of the cervical spine. Would 
consider outpatient discussion of longterm medications such as 
COX-2 inhibitors. 
-Extensive calcification of the right carotid bifurcation with 
less significant left carotid calcification seen on CT C-spine. 
Follow up with PCP. 
-Patient and family interested in referral to geriatrics for 
ongoing primary care. 
-Patient would benefit from maximal resources from elder 
services including access to nutritional supplementation 
-Given LVH on EKG and S4 on exam, may benefit from outpatient 
TTE for evaluation of structural heart disease. Additionally 
would benefit from ophthalmology eval as outpatient given 
evidence of end organ damage from HTN.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. 
Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:
On POD #1, patient was given 500ml IV fluid bolus for 
hypotension, which she responded to appropriately. Patient was 
noted to have some post-op delirium and dilaudid was decreased 
in dosage from ___ to 0.5-2mg every 4 hours as needed. 
Oxycodone and tramadol was avoided due to reported allergy. 
Morphine was avoided due to slightly elevated creatinine of 1.4. 
Overnight, patient was noted to have increased delirium with 
temp of 100.2 and urinalysis, repeat CBC was completed. UA was 
negative, hematocrit was 25.5 and WBC 12.8.

On POD #2, hematocrit was 24.2. and WBC 12.7. Patient was 
triggered for change in mental status in the afternoon and Tmax 
of 102.0. Patient was noted to have increased delirium with new 
oxygen requirement (88-90% on room air) and slightly tachycardic 
with HR in the low 100s. A fever work-up was completed, 
including urinalysis/cultures, blood cultures and chest x-ray. 
UA was borderline, showing moderate leukocytes, WBC 12, negative 
nitrates/epi. Chest X-ray showed pacification of the right and 
left lungs, with slight blurring of the pulmonary vessels 
represent atelectasis, however cannot exclude pneumonia. Patient 
was not given Tylenol due to reported allergy and was not given 
any other alternative PO anti-pyretic medication due to 
confusion at the time/inability to swallow pills. Cool pack/ice 
was given to the patient and fever resolved on its own. Patient 
remained afebrile overnight. Gabapentin was discontinued and no 
further narcotic medications were given. The Medicine team was 
consulted for co-management of care due to complex past medical 
history and recommended empiric treatment with Levaquin if cough 
develops or consideration of further testing to rule out PE if 
patient remained tachycardic or hypoxic.

On POD #3, hematocrit was 23.5, WBC 11.7 (downtrending) and 
creatinine improved to 1.2. Patient was alert and oriented to 
self, DOB, place. Patient reported right calf pain to palpation 
and a lower extremity ultrasound was obtained, which results 
were negative for DVT.

On POD #4, hematocrit was 22.3 and patient was transfused 1 unit 
packed red blood counts, which she tolerated well. 
Post-transfusion hematocrit was 29.4.

On POD #5, her hematocrit was stable at 25.9 and her creatinine 
was 1.3.  She was discharged to rehab with repeat lab follow-up 
(hematocrit and creatinine) within 2 days of discharge.  Her 
Lasix and Losartan continue to be held until creatinine 
stabilizes.  

Urine cultures showed mixed bacterial flora consistent with skin 
contamination, no treatment indicated. Blood cultures were 
pending at the time of discharge and patient will be contacted 
if further treatment is indicated.

Otherwise, the patient received Aspirin 325 mg twice daily for 
DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of POD#1.  The surgical 
dressing will remain on until ___. The patient was seen daily 
by physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout the hospital 
course and repleted accordingly. At the time of discharge the 
patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling well.  The 
patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The patient's 
hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately controlled on 
an oral regimen. The operative extremity was neurovascularly 
intact and the dressing was intact. 

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as 
tolerated on the operative extremity. 
 
Ms. ___ is discharged to rehab in stable condition.

Discharge Instructions:
1. Please return to the emergency department or notify your 
physician if you experience any of the following: severe pain 
not relieved by medication, increased swelling, decreased 
sensation, difficulty with movement, fevers greater than 101.5, 
shaking chills, increasing redness or drainage from the incision 
site, chest pain, shortness of breath or any other concerns.
 
2. Please follow up with your primary physician regarding this 
admission and any new medications and refills. 
 
3. Resume your home medications unless otherwise instructed.
 
4. You have been given medications for pain control. Please do 
not drive, operate heavy machinery, or drink alcohol while 
taking these medications. As your pain decreases, take fewer 
tablets and increase the time between doses. This medication can 
cause constipation, so you should drink plenty of water daily 
and take a stool softener (such as Colace) as needed to prevent 
this side effect.  Call your surgeons office 3 days before you 
are out of medication so that it can be refilled.  These 
medications cannot be called into your pharmacy and must be 
picked up in the clinic or mailed to your house.  Please allow 
an extra 2 days if you would like your medication mailed to your 
home.

because it had been spit in.  He was evasive and guarded and

in tongues.  He was easily distractible asking if we thought it

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt. medically cleared and admitted to ___ inpatient 
psychiatry service after spending 2 days in ED for agitated 
behavior requiring multiple chemical restraints. Patient 
evaluated upon arrival to unit and placed on 15 min checks. Pt. 
refused to sign a CV.

Psych: Pt. initial presentation consisted of psychotic symptoms, 
namely grandiose and paranoid delusions, of being ___ the 
___, being able to speak in tongues, thinking people had 
spit in his water. ___ also beleived that he could read the 
mind of the the young girl he pushed and believed that she was 
making fun of his breasts and acne scars. He consistently denied 
any auditory hallucinations. ___ thought disorder and 
disorganization of speech were quite striking during his initial 
presentation and early part of his hospitalization, 
characterized by extreme looseness of associations, bordering on 
pressured and angry derailed tirades. ___ also presented with 
noticeably flat affect despite his angry and irritable behavior 
early on in his admission. He initially refused to take any 
medication and denied anything was wrong. An affadavit for court 
commitment was filed prior to expiration of ___ and ___ 
was committed to unit for 45 days, and required to take 
medication. ___ was started on Geodon 40 mg BID, which was 
quickly titrated up to 60 mg BID and eventually 80 mg BID after 
5 days. He also received Ativan 1 mg q6 PRN anxiety and poor 
sleep which he used regularly. He tolerated the medications with 
minimal side effects, though some ? stiffness was noted and 
patient was given Cogentin as well with each dose of Geodon. In 
the second week of medication, ___ developed an episode of 
orthostatic hypotension and his dose was decreased to 60 mg BID 
for 1 week. His orthostatis resolved with increased PO intake, 
and ___ was able to be titrated back up to 80 mg BID, Cogentin 
was also d/c'd. It was felt Geodon would be an appropriate 
antipsychotic for ___ given its neutral metabolic profile, 
ability for IM dosing if needed, lower risk for EPS, and little 
risk of prolaction elevation (given concern over breasts). ___ 
responded very slowly over the first 2 weeks of medication, 
showing improvement in his thought disorder and speech 
organization. The most striking feature of ___ hospital 
course, though, were his marked negative sxs which seemed to 
worsen during his stay: flat affect, alogia, withdrawal, apathy, 
and demoralization. It was thought that ___ likely was 
suffering from post-psychotic depression. Through discussions 
about his presentation and literature review, it was thought 
___ might benefit from initiation of Mirtazapine to help with 
negative sxs. He was started on 15 mg HS. Unfortunately, ___ 
did not tolerate the medication well, and developed intolerable 
sedation. The medication was thus discontinued on ___.  The 
patient was continued on the Geodon 60mg PO BID which he 
tolerated and was also continued on Cogentin 1mg PO BID PRN and 
Ativan 1mg PO TID PRN. The patient was discharged with 
prescriptions for the above medications and with a plan to 
follow up with his psychiatrist in two weeks.

As far as Mr. ___ diagnosis. He is ___ yo male admitted with 
bizarre and agitated behavior, exhibiting grandiose and paranoid 
delusions, and severe thought disorder. Patient has a ___ year 
history dating back to age ___ of depressive sxs and obsessive 
traits, 1 pior SA, and suffered the loss of his mother to CA at 
age ___. Last ___ patient had ___ psychotic episode, initially 
thought to be manic as well, but from discussions with outpt. 
psychiatrist and viewing d/c summary, there is little evidence 
of a manic episode. Based on current presentation and past 
history, it appears that Mr. ___ is suffering from the early 
beginnings of Schizophrenia, likely paranoid type, with 
pronounced negative symptoms and subsequent post-psychotic 
depression.

In the future, if patient does not show adequate remission of 
symptoms with geodon, it may be reasonable to try Risperdone, 
given the availability of a long-acting injectable form. Also, a 
re-trial of Mirtazapine may also be a consideration in the 
future if ___ negative/cognitive sxs continue to be an issue, 
though a lower starting dose would be recommended with slow 
upward titration.

Medical: ___ initially complained is some hand pain and 
tingling in his right hand secondary to injury from concert. 
Physical exam of this region was benign. No imaging was felt to 
be necessary. Patient was managed with PRN Ibuprofen with good 
effect. One episode of orthostasis as noted above on unit, 
responded well to decrease in Geodon dose and increased PO 
intake. The patient did not experience any other medical issues 
during his hospitalization. His vitals were monitored daily and 
apart from the orthostatic episode remained stable. He will f/u 
with his PCP upon discharge.

Social: SW evaluation done on admission. SW in contact with 
family throughout stay. Conference call made with ___ and 
psychiatry resident during initial part of stay to discuss 
diagnosis, treatment, and likely dispo planning. Also, ___ 
court-ordered to contact ___ to bring school materials.

SINGLE PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: There has been previous 
sternotomy, with 
midline sternal wires and prosthetic mitral valve again 
identified. Marked 
cardiomegaly is again noted with bilateral peripheral 
interstitial opacities. 
Findings may be related to chronic interstitial lung disease 
though 
superimposed mild congestion is also probable. There is no 
pleural effusion. 
The bony thorax is unremarkable. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
1. Cardiomegaly with probable mild congestion. 
.
___ CT abd/pelvis
IMPRESSION: 
1. No evidence of mesenteric ischemia. 
2. New bilateral perinephric stranding, a nonspecific finding. 
This may be 
related to medical renal disease. 
3. Reticulonodular opacities at the lung bases likely reflect 
edema 
superimposed on chronic interstitial lung disease. 
4. Cardiomegaly with right heart failure. 
5. Small volume ascites.  
.
___ CT head
IMPRESSION: 
  
1. No evidence of infarction or hemorrhage, allowing for the 
presence of 
intravenous contrast from the preceding abdominal/pelvic CT. 
.
___ CT head
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute hemorrhage or acute large 
vascular territory 
infarcts. Prominence of the ventricles slightly out of 
proportion to 
prominence of the sulci is unchanged compared to ___. 
Periventricular 
hypodensities may represent chronic small vessel ischemic 
disease, 
transependymal migration of CSF, or a combination of the two; 
comparison with 
earlier prior imaging, if available, may be helpful in assessing 
change over 
time. 
.
___ CXR
The heart is enlarged. Mitral valve replacement is present. The 
interstitial 
failure present on the prior chest ___ appears 
less marked but 
this could be due to technical differences and I suspect that 
some 
interstitial failure is still present. Atelectasis is again 
present. 
  
IMPRESSION: Persistent cardiomegaly, interstitial failure 
possibly better. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital course was as follows: 

In the ___, initial BP 80/palp per ___ RN. Given 500 cc bolus and 
BPs improved to 103/56. She continued to be fluid resuscitated 
with a total of 4L NS. NGL lavage performed with return of dark, 
coffee-grounds. Labs significant for Hct 29.8 (baseline mid 
30___s), INR 21.2, venous lactate 10.7, Cr 3.6 (baseline 1.4 - 
1.9), troponin 0.02, CK 81. The patient was given 2 units pRBC, 
2 units FFP, panoprazole 40 mg IV X 1, and vit K 10 mg IV X 1. 
Given elevated venous lactate, a CTA abd/pelvis was performed 
that showed no signs of mesenteric ischemia, bibasilar lung 
opacities, non-specific bilateral perinephric stranding possibly 
related to renal failure, and ascites, pericholecystic fluid, 
and RV enlargement suggestive of R sided heart failure. She was 
seen by GI consult and admitted to the MICU for further care.  
.
In the MICU, GI performed EGD and noted esophagitis/gastritis 
and to have large clot in stomach but no active bleeding. 
Hematocrit nadir was 27, transfused 2 units w/ appropriate 
increase. Reversed anticoagulation w/ vitamin K, now on heparin 
gtt as INR<2 w/o new bleeding. Also patient noted to have a 
history of interstitial lung disease (f/b Dr. ___ and 
does not have home O2 but currently w/ O2 requirement s/p IVF 
resuscitation on arrival given hypovolemic hypotension in 
setting of bleed. Her O2 requirement has been lessening w/ 
diuresis. The morning of transfer, the patient was noticed to be 
slightly confused and does have a h/o sundowing. A head CT was 
negative for bleed and then found +U/A so started ciprofloxacin 
which was changed to ceftriaxone for concerns of deleriogenesis. 

.
Please see the following problem list for the pt's course once 
called out to the medical floor:
.
*) Increasing O2 requirement: Likely ___ volume overload from 
diastolic heart failure in combination with known interstitial 
lung disease. s/p echo ___ with EF 60-70%. Pt received IV lasix 
to a goal of -1.5L for approx 5 days and was transitioned to PO 
lasix when no longer exhibited signs of fluid overload. She 
continued to have a fluctuating O2 requirement and NC was 
titrated to >93%. On discharge, patient was satting well on 2L 
off of lasix.
.
*) Upper GI bleed: In setting of supratherapeutic INR. s/p 2u 
pRBC. Resolved and Hct stable s/p transfusion and Vit K. EGD 
with esophagitis, gastritis, clot but no acute bleeding. 
Continued BID protonix. Daily hcts were stable and increased 
throughout stay.  
.  
*) Anti-Coagulation/MVR - Patient on IV heparin with goal 50-70 
for anticogagulation for MVR. Initially on coumadin 2mg QD, 
which was eventually increased to her home regimen of 10mg 
___ and 15mg ___. On discharge, INR was 3.1 and heparin gtt 
discontinued. Patient to have close follow up with ___ 
Clinic.
.
*) Confusion/dementia: Pt with occasional severe agitation. Last 
episode ___ AM (pulled out IVs, refusing PO meds and O2NC). 
Likely secondary to underlying dementia/sundowning. Pt received 
zyprexa and haldol prn. Per daughter, this is her baseline.
.  
*) Acute on chronic renal failure: Prerenal, baseline Cr 
1.4-1.6. Followed Cr daily. On discharge, creatinine was 1.5.
.  
*) Cardiac - EF 60-70%. Continued metoprolol and transitioned to 
XL. Lisinopril was decreased as BPs were low normal. Continued 
statin.
.
*) UTI: Pt received cipro x 3d. Cx negative.
.  
*) s/p MVR - Mechanical valve. Heparin as above.  
.  
*) Hypothryoidism - Continued synthroid at home doses. TSH 0.68, 
free T4 normal.  
.  
*) DM II - Continue ISS while in house, but pt with little 
requirement. D/C'd on HD#12. Restarted metformin 1 day prior to 
discharge.

history. EKG was unchanged from previous and troponins were 
negative. The patient was admitted and placed on telemetry. She 
was noted to be bradycardic into the ___ and her Toprol XL 
was held with improvment in her heart rate to the ___. It 
was thought that the pre-syncope could be a combination of 
diabetic dysautonomia and orthostasis secondary to excessive 
beta blockade. The patient did not have any further pre-syncopal 
episodes while in the hospital, nor was she orthostatic based on 
vital signs. She was discharged to follow up with her PCP as an 
outpatient for further managment of her medications.

# Diabetes mellitus: Pt's HbA1C was 6.6 in ___. Because of 
her elevated creatinine, the patient's metformin was 
discontinued and she was started on an insulin sliding scale

**ACUTE ISSUES**
# Coagulopathy with Supratherapeutic INR: INR reported to be 9.2 
from outside laboratory and patient referred to ED, where INR 
was found to be 12.5. This is most likely due to combination of 
poor PO intake and inappropriate medication use. Patient found 
to be hypotensive in ED to SBP in the ___ and CT abd/pelvis was 
done to r/o bleeding. Patient given 5mg vitamin K and INR was 
allowed to drift down to 4.9, at which point warfarin was 
restarted at 2.5mg. INR continued to drift down to 3.5 and her 
dose was increased to 5mg at discharge in order to remain 
therapeutic. She will need an INR check on ___.

declined this option.

# Hematuria: noted on exam on HD2 while Foley was in place. UA 
was not consistent with UTI; Hct remained stable and hematuria 
resolved with observation. 

# Acute on chronic kidney disease: Likely due to poor PO intake. 
Patient's baseline creatinine likely ~1.8-2.0 and on admission 
was 2.6. Resolved with IVF and was 1.9 at discharge. Lisinopril 
and Lasix were held in this setting. 

**CHRONIC ISSUES**

History of Present Illness:
___ F w/ h/o HTN, lower extremity edema and afib on coumadin 
was brought in by family for concern of lethargy and found to be 
hyponatremic to 106. Pt had an unwitnessed fall on ___ 
but denies head strike or LOC. She briefly c/o posterior right 
shoulder which resolved shortly afterwards. Family noticed that 
pt had increasing fatigue and mild intermittent confusion over 
the past week. Her son said that on ___ they were able to 
complete a 2 block walk, longer than her usual walks, and did 
not experience SOB but felt fatigued afterwards. Pt has not had 
fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, dysuria, abdominal 
pain or bowel changes. However, family noted decreased appetite, 
po intake and urine output during this time. Pt lives alone and 
according to her son is normally quite functional and 
independently prepares her own food, reliably takes her 
medications and walks stably with a cane. Pt had complained of 
increased lower extremity edema during this time and in an 
effort to decrease edema pt reportedly decreased her fluid 
intake. When son stayed with his mother over the weekend and 
noticed decreased uop, the family recommended that she drink 
free water. Per family report she continued to take her 
prescibed doses of her medications, including ___ meds 
HCTZ, diovan and felodipine. Pt has had chronic lower extremity 
edema worsening over the past month and was evaluated by PCP ___ 
___ and ___. On both visits pt was found to have 3+ pitting 
edema in lower extremities with clear lungs and ___ 
JVP, not clinically determined to by volume overloaded. On ___ 
pt was found to be hyponatremic to 128 (baseline Na ___ over 
past year). PCP recommended compression stockings which she has 
not been compliant with, and discontinuation of felodipine 
however pt was hesitant to do so since she felt the CCB was 
improving her bp. Also of note, on ___, pt's weight was 131.5lbs 
(59 kilos) and had elevated INR of 4.7 (previously within ___ 
INR goal, on ___ INR 2.4).

Last echo (stress) ___: normal LVEF >55%, no wall motion 
abnormalities, no evidence of inducible ischemia, poor 
functional exercise capacity. Mild to moderate mitral 
regurgitation at rest. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Mild 
pulmonary hypertension.

SaO2Sat: 100. Labs notable for Na 106, K 2.9, Cl 73, Ca 7.9, 
Phos 1.3, Mg 1.8.
CXR showed bilateral pleural effusions, pulmonary edema and 
possible right lower lobe atelectasis. Pt was started on empiric 
antibiotic coverage with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Pt was 
started on NS at 100cc/hr.
 
On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were 97.8, hr 64, bp 
147/78, rr 19, Sa02 93% on RA. Repeat labs after pt received 
~150cc NS showed Na 106, K 3.1. Pt was continued on NS at 
100cc/hr and electrolyes repleted with Mg sulfate, K phos and Ca 
gluconate. After ~500cc NS repeat Na was still 106. After ~666cc 
NS repeat Na was 107 and Ca 8.2, Phos 2.8, Mg 2.5. Renal was 
consulted regarding starting hypertonic 3%NS. 
 
Review of systems:  
(+) Per HPI. Pt reported poor sleep over ___ and ___ 
nights for unclear reason and increased Tenderness near iv site 
on right forarm that began in ED. Pt has chronic constipation

Brief Hospital Course:
___ F w/ week of increasing fatigue, confusion and poor po 
intake found to be hyponatremic to 106 with altered mental 
status.
.
Severe symptomatic hyponatremia of unclear etiology, resolving
- admitted to the ICU for hypertonic saline and furosemide
- Nephrology consulted
- ultimately thought to have been multifactorial, possibly 
diuretic related vs. SIADH
- volume status difficult to assess given the issues noted below
- fluid restriction 800mL/day

lengthening and moderate TR, MR, pulmonary hypertension. EKG in 
ED did not show evidence of strain or ischemia. First set ___ 
and CKMB within normal limits. Repeat BNP was similar to prior, 
mildy elevated. Improvement in respiratory satus and decreased 
O2 requirement with iv lasix suggested some volume over load
- her lower extremity edema was ultimately attributed to her 
calcium channel blocker, so felodipine was held
.
HTN, diastolic CHF
- ___ management guided by Nephrology with PCP
- atorvastatin and carvedilol were continued (latter at max 
dose)
- stopped CCB given confusion about volume status (was it 
causing leg swelling?)

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female admitted to the hospital with  abdominal 
pain, nausea, and elevated white blood cell count.  Upon 
admission, the patient was made NPO, given intravenous fluids, 
and underwent imaging which showed perforated appendicitis. She 
was started on a course of antibiotics ceftriaxone and flagyl 
and underwent serial abdominal examinations. 

The patient was taken to the operating room on HD # 3 where she 
underwent a laparoscopic appendectomy.  Intra-operative findings 
were notable for acute perforated appendicitis with phlegmon and 
an abscess.  There was a 100 cc blood loss.  The patient was 
extubated after the procedure and monitored in the recovery 
room.  

During the post-operative course, she was febrile with an 
elevated white blood cell count. Her surgical pain was 
controlled with intravenous analgesia. Because of the 
temperature spikes, the patient underwent a cat scan of the 
abdomen on POD #5 and she was reported to have a right lower 
quadrant collection.  She was taken to interventional radiology 
where a drain was placed. Her abdominal pain persisted and she 
underwent another cat scan of the abdomen which showed an 
additional fluid collection posterior to the uterus.  She 
returned to ___ on POD #11 where another drain was placed.  Over 
the next ___ hours her white blood cell count began to normalize. 
 She continued on her course of ceftriaxone and flagyl.  

The patient was discharged home on POD #14.  Her antibiotics 
were discontinued and her white blood cell count was stable at 
11. She was transitioned to oral analgesia and was voiding 
without difficulty.  She had return of bowel function.  Her 
vital signs were stable and she was afebrile.  Discharge 
instructions were reviewed and questions answered.  A follow-up 
appointment was made in the Acute care clinic.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Of note, during the patient's hospitalization, she noted a left 
leg lesion.  The Dermatology service was consulted and advised 
removal of the lesion.  An appointment was made for follow-up by 
the Dermatology service.   They will call the patient with the 
time and place of the appointment.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain and found 
to have a perforation in your appendix. You were given IV 
antibiotics but continued to have pain and signs and symptoms of 
infection. You were taken to the operating room to have your 
appendix removed laparoscopically, and the infection washout out 
of your abdomen. After surgery, you continued to an elevation in 
your white blood cell count.  On imaging, you were reported to 
have fluid collections in your abdomen for which drains were 
placed.  Since then, your white blood cell count and your pain 
has decreased.  You continue on antibiotics.  Your are preparing 
for discharge home with ___ services for drain care assistance 
with the following instructions:

Please follow up at the appointment in clinic listed below. We 
also generally recommend that patients follow up with their 
primary care provider after having surgery. We have scheduled an 
appointment for you listed below.
ACTIVITY:
 
Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
You may climb stairs. 
You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until you 
see your surgeon at your next visit.
Don't lift more than ___ lbs for ___ weeks. (This is about the 
weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies to 
lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming.
 
HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
You may feel weak or ""washed out"" a couple weeks. You might want 
to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during surgery.
You could have a poor appetite for a couple days. Food may seem 
unappealing.
All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go 
away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your 
incisions. Under these dressings you have small plastic bandages 
called steristrips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks. 
(These are the thin paper strips that might be on your 
incision.) But if they fall off before that that's okay.
Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This is 
normal.
You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.
Do not use any ointments on the incision unless you were told 
otherwise.
You may see a small amount of clear or light red fluid staining 
your dressing or clothes. If the staining is severe, please call 
your surgeon.
You may shower. As noted above, ask your doctor when you may 
resume tub baths or swimming.
 
YOUR BOWELS:
Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain 
medicaitons. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as 
Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of 
magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these

prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain 
medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your 
surgeon has said its okay.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ year old male with a past medical history 
only significant for HLD who presented with chest pain.  The 
patient states that 2 weeks ago he experienced exertional, 
substernal chest pressure on exertion (occurred while playing 
basketball) which subsequently resolved after a few minutes. 
Within the past few days, he has noticed episodes of burning 
chest pain which he thought was due to GERD.  The episodes have 
been occuring both with activity and at rest and last a few 
minutes in duration.  He had been taking TUMs.  The night prior 
to admission he awoke 4 times in the middle of the night with 
the burning chest pain- each episode lasted about ___ minutes. 
 On the day of presentation he experienced the worst episode of 
substernal chest pressure and burning, which he rated at a ___ 
in severity.  He denied any dyspnea during these episodes.  He 
subsequently called EMS, was given 4 baby aspirin in the 
ambulence, and was brought to the ___ ED. 
 
In the ED, initial EKG was significant for ST elevations in 
V1-V4 and the patient was taken for cardiac catheterization.  
In the cardiac cath lab, the patient received 600mg Plavix as 
well as 5400 heparin bolus.  Following placement of the wire, he 
was noted to have a reperfusion rhythm, AIVR. Cardiac cath was 
significant for complete occlusion of the proximal LAD and a 
drug eluting stent was placed.

___ CHEST X-RAY
FINDINGS:  This examination is underpenetrated, accentuating 
density of the parenchyma. Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Low 
lung volumes accentuate heart size and pulmonary vasculature 
howevere there is no overt fluid overload. Lungs are clear.  
There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
  
IMPRESSION:  No cardiopulmonary abnormality on this 
underpenetrated study. 

___ TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal 
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall 
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally 
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an anterior 
space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. 

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular 
cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic 
function. No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.

___ TRANSESOPHAGEAL ECHOCARDIOGRAM
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of 
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right 
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen 
by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in 
the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are 
mildly thickened. There are filamentous strands on the aortic 
leaflets consistent with Lambl's excresences (normal variant). 
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: No intracardiac thrombus. Mild ___ regurgitation. 

  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo female presenting with dyspnea on exertion found with new 
onset symptomatic Afib with RVR and signs of volume overload.

# New onset Afib w/RVR: Pt presenting with shortness of breath 
and dyspnea on exertion which has acutely worsened over the week 
prior to admission. Pt thought to be in Afib for >48 hours upon 
presentation, outside of the window for cardioversion without 
TEE. Pt describes months of episodic dyspnea on exertion, 
self-treated as asthma with albuterol inhaler, but were perhaps 
possibly ___ paroxysms of Afib. Rate was not controlled on max 
dose diltiazem 15 mg/hr and metoprolol 400mg daily. She was 
bridged with heparin to a therapeutic INR on warfarin and 
underwent TEE/cardioversion with successful converstion to sinus 
rhythm. However, after cardioversion, pt developed >4.5 sec 
sinus pauses and bradycardia to ___. For this reason, she was 
not discharged on a beta blocker. She was set up to have an 
event monitor, with a plan to start low dose metoprolol 
succinate if she no longer has sinus pauses. INR was 3.6 on day 
of discharge; pt was prescribed warfarin 1mg, with instructions 
to hold the warfarin until INR check at ___ 
___ clinic on the day after discharge. 

# sinus pauses: occurred overnight after cardioversion, >4.5 
sec, asymptomatic. Unclear if these pauses occurred while 
patient was lying supine; she was not wearing CPAP at the time. 
Differential includes OSA vs. excessive nodal blockade vs. sick 
sinus syndrome. Pt has a history of non-compliance with CPAP and 
was counseled on the importance of CPAP for preventing sinus 
pauses and ectopy that could re-initiate her atrial 
fibrillation. Betablockade was held as above. Pt observed for 24 
hours while compliant with CPAP and did not have significant 
sinus pauses. She was arranged to have event monitor for ___ 
weeks, and to follow up with Dr. ___ in one month to monitor 
for further sinus pauses while off the beta blocker.

# orthopnea: CXR with vascular congestion. Pt likely with flash 
pulmonary edema ___ tachyarrythmia. Echo showed preserved 
systolic function, suboptimal images, could not comment on PA 
pressure. Given hives to HCTZ, a sulfa-moeity, initially avoided 
lasix in favor of ethacrynic acid, however net even with this 
agent. Ultimately diuresed with lasix IV without skin reaction, 
and orthopnea resolved. Pt still with baseline dyspnea on 
exertion. 

# Leukocytosis: Pt afebrile without focal infection signs. 
Leukocytosis persisted for 3 days; UA positive however culture 
grew mixed flora suggesting fecal contaminant. Leukocytosis 
resolved after removal of foley and 3 day course of ceftriaxone. 


# HTN: Home atenolol and amlodipine held while titrating nodal 
agents. Pt discharged on home dose of amlodipine but held beta 
blockade as above.

# OSA: Patient intermittently uses CPAP at home. Encouraged use 
and educated on importance of CPAP. Pt observed to be compliant 
towards the end of the admission.

Atrial Fibrillation with RVR, s/p TEE/cardioversion

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 
Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure to take care of you during your stay at ___. 
You came in with shortness of breath and were found to have an 
abnormal fast heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation. We were 
unable to slow down your heart rate with medicines, so we 
scheduled you for an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) 
which showed no clot, and then shocked the heart. This 
successfully converted your heart back to normal rhythm. 

You had a little extra fluid on your body from your heart not 
pumping efficiently while it was in Afib. We diuresed you with 
lasix and will be sending you home a small dose of lasix 20mg to 
take daily at home.

After the conversion, you had some very long pauses of your 
heart beat. Because of this we want you to wear a heart rhythm 
monitor for ___ weeks at home, to make sure you are not having 
more pauses, and also monitor if you go back into Afib. ___ 
___ will be in touch with you about this heart monitor, 
which you will receive at home in the mail within 3 business 
days.

We discussed the importance of wearing your CPAP to prevent 
converting back to Afib, and also to prevent the pauses we 
observed. Talk to your PCP about getting reconnected to a sleep 
center to keep your CPAP machine maintained and make sure you 
have the best-fitting mask.

When people are in atrial fibrillation, they are at risk of 
developing clots in the heart, which can break off and cause a 
stroke. To prevent this risk, you will need to take a blood 
thinner called warfarin, in case you go back into atrial 
fibrillation.  You will have to get your INR (a measure of how 
thin your blood is) checked regularly with the ___ 
clinic at ___ to make sure you are on the right 
dose of warfarin. You should get your INR checked tomorrow, 
___.

events concerning for seizure
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

 
History of Present Illness:
___ year old right handed man with MS complicated by PML
while on Tysabri followed by ___ presenting with report of
possible seizures on Keppra 1250 mg BID. Patient reports 
episodes
in question started about one month ago, for the last week
occurring daily. Patient is followed by outpatient neurologist
Dr. ___ (cell ___. History is obtained from
patient, patient's girlfriend of ___ years in person (though
currently separated), and Dr. ___ phone. 

Patient and girlfriend report that patient diagnosed with MS in
___ in the setting of left eye decreased vision and right sided
weakness. Patient maintained on Tysabri for years until 
developed
PML in ___, per current primary neurologist Dr. ___ was followed by ___. Patient was referred to Dr. ___
he developed PML. Per report had a right frontal lesion, had
initially slight cognitive deficits then became overtly frontal,
then improved somewhat. 

Patient reports that previously his MS was largely characterized
by fatigue but that during this period he was diffusely quite
weak, very ill, hospitalized for four months. Around this time
patient reports that he had about 4 episodes of staring, being
unresponsive for ___ minutes spread out over time (months in
between). At some point over this time patient was started on
Keppra 1000 mg BID, and he was maintained on this dose until
about a month ago. 

About a month ago patient began experiencing different episodes.
He reports that these seem to start on the inside of his right
thigh with stiffening and cramping, then stiffening and low
amplitude shaking of bilateral lower extremities, shoulders, and
possibly arms, as well. Patient reports that when this happens 
he
will grab on to the railing of his bed. Sometimes patient 
reports
he has preserved awareness during and tries to keep track of the
clock (he thinks at times that he maintains awareness throughout
the entire episode but does, of note, have baseline short-term
memory difficulties). Other times patient will lose awareness 
and
come to holding onto the bed rail. The episodes typically last
___ minutes and are followed by patient being confused, tired,
sore, out of it for about 10 minutes or so, resting and getting
his bearings. Per report patient's son has witnessed several of
these episodes and has been unable to get father to respond
during. Patient reports son will try to put pressure on his
extremities to stop them from shaking and that this possibly
helps. 

Patient and girlfriend report that when these new episodes
started patient went to an OSH ED (possibly ___,
also possibly ___ at least at one point) in the
setting of an episode of unresponsiveness, not knowing where he
was or who he was (unclear if this was following one of the
shaking spells). At that time Keppra was increased to 1250 mg 
BID
and then about two weeks later to 1500 mg BID. Per patient the
episodes seemed better on 1500 mg BID, had seemed to quiet down,
so Keppra was weaned to 1250 mg BID. Per patient neurologist Dr.
___ on the phone, these episodes seemed to be better controlled
on Keppra 1500 mg BID but patient had cognitive slowing so was
decreased back to 1250 mg BID. Patient denies side effects on
Keppra 1500 mg BID and does not recall having had cognitive
slowing. 

Over the past week, patient reports he is now having these
shaking spells about daily, some days more than once. 

Per Dr. ___ had considered starting Lamictal given patient
per report with preserved awareness (at least when episodes
start) and also with known per report right frontal lesion
thought ___ PML (suggesting possibly focal seizures). However,
given increasing frequency of episodes, was concerned about
starting a medication requiring slow uptitration. As such,
referred patient to ___ ED for possible medication adjustment
and evaluation (including possible EEG) in the setting of these
frequent and prolonged spells. 

Patient reports that he has never had an EEG. Reports that his
last MRI was two weeks ago. 

Reports baseline difficulties thinking and speaking 
(particularly
with short term memory often repeating himself and with reading 
-
reports that this takes significant effort and is slow); patient
and girlfriend estimate that this has been about stable since 
his
PML.

Also reports baseline slightly decreased vision in the left eye,
left facial weakness, left greater than right extremity weakness
(reports that was initially weak on the right around the time of
MS diagnosis but then became more weak on the left with PML,
especially weak in the left hand), baseline muscle spasms and
cramping, spasticity throughout but particularly in his right
lower extremity. 

At baseline patient walks short distances with a walker, uses a
manual chair for longer distances. Typically does ___ (previously
twice per week then spaced to weekly). Has not had ___ in over 5
weeks given he gets this through ___ and ___ 
is
currently on ___ break. Reports increasing tightness, muscle
cramping, spasms in the setting of not getting his ___. Also
normally tries to walk outside if possible, is not possible in
the ___. Son does stretch patient night but still has noticed
recent worsening of spasms and tightness. 

Episodes per report typically consist of whole body shaking, at
times with preserved awareness, lasting ___ minutes. Also with
staring spells, per report he is conscious during but reports he
is unable to respond. 

Patient is current maintained on Copaxone (M, W, F - unknown
dose) as well as maraviroc for ___, likely to wean off 
maraviroc
in the near future.  

Reports right shoulder radiating to the elbow and then back
across his chest while sitting or lying certain ways for about
the past two weeks. 

No recent illnesses. Denies recent vision changes, diplopia,
vertigo, dizziness, tinnitus, hearing difficulty, new weakness,
new numbness apart from the intermittent right
arm/chest/shoulder. Denies recent changes in cognition. 

Denies recent fevers, cough, congestion, shortness of breath,
chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain, constipation, 
diarrhea,
rashes. Endorses baseline thirst, dry mouth, and significant
diaphoresis to the point that he drinks 72 ounces of water 
before
bed nightly and wears a condom catheter overnight. Sleeps about
___ hours each night. Needs to take nighttime medications to 
have
muscle spasms and discomfort under control to be able to sleep. 

Endorses low mood, feeling like he is not adding anything.

OTHER DIAGNOSTICS
=================
EEG - ___
This is continuous EEG recording captures one pushbutton 
activation for right shoulder shrugging, and variable right arm, 
torso and head tremors which last for one minute and has no 
electrographic correlate; consistent with a psychogenic 
non-epileptic event (PNES). Otherwise the background activity is 
normal and a well-organized 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm is 
seen. There are no seizures or epileptiform discharges. 

EEG - ___
This is continuous EEG recording that captured two pushbutton 
activations where there was no electrographic correlate. The 
background 
activity is normal. No focal, lateralized or epileptiform 
discharges were 
seen. 

EEG - ___
This is a normal continuous ICU monitoring study. There are no 
pushbutton activations. There are no electrographic seizures or 
epileptiform discharges. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ M w PMHx MS ___ PML / ___ (R 
frontal lesion) and suspected seizures (staring spells, on 
keppra) who is admitted for characterization for a new spell 
type (severe painful R thigh spasm followed by whole body 
spasms, no LOC during event per patient but sleepy/confused/weak 
after, occurring multiple times per day). 
He was hooked up to cvEEG and multiple stereotypical ""spasm"" 
spells were captured. There was no electrographic correlate. On 
video, spells appear more consistent with PNES than pain 
reactions or muscle spasms. 
His home LEV was then discontinued in an attempt to capture his 
other spell semiology (""staring""). Despite this, no spells were 
captured over several days. Keppra was re-started at discharge 
given staring spells were not captured and patient is at risk 
for seizures.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted for shortness of breath, most likely due fluid 
retention. This is most likely due to the blood received at your 
last hospitalization and your kidney injury. We were able to 
increase your water pills to give you more relief.  

Please weigh yourself everday. Let your doctor know if you gain 
more than 3 lbs. Your weight on discharge was 61.4 kg (135.4 kg)

In addition, your blood pressure was a little bit high. At your 
last hospitalization at ___, they had discontinued 
lisinopril because you had some additional kidney injury (which 
was mostly likely due to low blood counts). Here, it appears 
that your kidney function has returned to your baseline 
(creatinine 2.0), so we feel comfortable restarting your 
lisinopril.

During your hospitalization, we received records from ___ 
that indicate that you have a H. pylori infection in your 
stomach. We started you on ""triple therapy"" which you should 
continue to take for a 14 day course.

Please continue to take your medications as prescribed.

with the assistance of the patient's grad-daughter via video 
chat.

The patient takes her BP at home daily. For the past week she 
has noticed increasing systolic numbers, with this morning being 
the highest in the 190s. Today she also felt dizzy and unwell. 
Some chest pressure vs palpitations also. No dyspnea, headaches, 
vision changes, PND, orthopnea, leg swelling.

She lives with her son and grand-daughter. She is independent in 
ADLs, uses a cane to ambulate. She takes her own medications, 
but cannot name them for me (she tells me ""blood pressure 
medicine, stomach medicine, insulin""). She tells me she does not

# RHYTHM: sinus 

# HTN EMERGENCY: Patient presented with SBPs 220s to ED, with 
associated dizziness and chest pain and troponin elevation of 
0.02. EKG with ST-depressions in II, V3-V6, similar to prior, 
troponins peaked at 0.03.  The trigger for her uncontrolled 
blood pressure is unclear at this time. She manages her own 
medication, raising some concern for medication compliance, 
although she does fill her medications regularly. She has also 
has advanced CKD, which is likely playing a role. She was 
initially on a nitro gtt, able to be weaned back to home regimen 
of metoprolol XL 25, doxazosin 1 mg BID, hydralazine 100 mg TID, 
imdur 60 qD. BPs labile with BPs to 180s-190s on this regimen, 
so metoprolol was discontinued and carvedilol 12.5 BID 
initiated, later uptitrated to 25 mg BID. She was discharged on 
carvedilol 25mg BID.  

# CHRONIC DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE: EF > 55% in ___ with 2+ MR. 
___ euvolemic on exam. CXR without acute process. Continued 
on home furosemide 40 daily. Discharge Dry Weight 56kg. 

# CAD: hx of MI per OMR, although patient/family denies. 
Continued on home pravastatin, metoprolol XL 25, and ASA 81 
daily .

# CKD: baseline Cr 2.7 - 3.5, at baseline on admission. Patient 
is followed closely by her outpatient nephrologist. Dialysis was 
discussed in the recent past, which the patient was not 
interested in. Cr remained relatively stable throughout 
admission, discharged with cr 3.6.  

# DM II: insulin dependent. Blood sugar on admission of 400, no 
anion gap, normalized to 150s upon arrival to the floor. 
Continued on home glargine 10 U qPM, held home glipizide, 
Januvia.

IMAGING:
========
___ KNEE W/O CONTRAST RI
1. Large knee joint effusion with associated synovitis.  No 
specific features for gout, however this could be further 
evaluated with arthrocentesis which I understand has been 
performed.
2. Degenerative changes as detailed above.  Tiny area of signal 
abnormality
along the posterior horn of the medial meniscus equivocal for 
small tear.  No large tear or ligamentous injury.
3. Cortical tunneling in the distal femur reflecting 
demineralization without aggressive infiltrative process 
identified.  This accounts for the
radiographic appearance.
   
___ (2 VIEWS) RIGHT
Moderate right knee joint effusion or synovitis.
There is mild degenerative arthritis of the right knee.
Diffuse small lucencies throughout visualized bones, with 
periarticular
spurring, consider disuse osteopenia, reflex sympathetic 
dystrophy or marrow infiltrative/neoplastic process if 
clinically appropriate.
   
___
The left atrial volume index is severely increased. No atrial 
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated 
right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Doppler parameters 
are most consistent with Grade II (moderate) left ventricular 
diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free 
wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, 
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and 
no aortic stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to 
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be 
significantly UNDERestimated.] There is moderate pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a 
prominent fat pad. 
   
___ (PORTABLE AP)
No significant interval change since the prior radiograph.
   
___ (PORTABLE AP)
Persistent moderate cardiomegaly and lung hyperinflation.  No 
focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
  
___ U.S.
No hydronephrosis.  Atrophic kidneys demonstrating cortical 
thinning
consistent with chronic parenchymal disease.  Simple bilateral 
renal cysts are incidentally noted.
  
___ (PA & LAT)
1.  Persistent moderate cardiomegaly and lung hyperinflation.  
No focal
consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
 
2.  The extent of pulmonary vascular congestion could be 
chronic, as it is
unchanged.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is an ___ y/o woman with a past medical history of 
chronic kidney injury (stage V), chronic anemia (EPO-dependent), 
CAD, HFpEF, HTN, and T2DM, who presented with shortness of 
breath, chest discomfort, and dizziness with blood pressures 
>200/90. 

# HFpEF exacerbation | Hypertensive Urgency | Volume Overload:
Initial concern for pneumonia, given possible retrocardiac 
opacity on plain film; however, final read of CXR negative for 
new infiltrate. Influenza negative. Cough with subjective fevers 
at home without leukocytosis. Exam and work-up suggestive of 
volume overload in the setting of diastolic HF and end-stage 
renal disease. TTE showed severe diastolic dysfunction, but no 
significant change from prior. She had minimal troponinemia 
without ischemic EKG changes attributed by cardiology to demand 
and poor renal clearance. Patient was initially started on IV 
hydralazine and nitroglycerin drip and continued on her home 
blood pressure medications (isosorbide 
mononitrate/carvedilol/doxazosin) for blood pressure lowering 
and aggressive diuresis with IV furosemide (80-120mg). She 
diuresed well, with improvement in her shortness of breath and 
lower extremity edema. Renal was consulted and recommended slow 
blood pressure lowering with permissive hypertension and target 
SBP 160s in the first few days with avoidance of DBP lowering 
below the ___. She was subsequently weaned off the nitroglycerin 
drip and the hydralazine and started on amlodipine 5mg daily, 
with improved blood pressure control. Dizziness, which was not 
accompanied by focal neurologic deficits, resolved with improved 
antihypertensive control. At discharge, her blood pressure was 
120-150s/50-60s. She also was started on torsemide 20mg PO daily 
for maintenance diuresis.

# Right Knee Gout: 
Patient developed right knee swelling on ___ in the setting of 
aggressive diuresis. The knee joint was aspirated and sent for 
gram stain, culture, cell counts, and crystal analysis. Crystal 
analysis was consistent with negatively birefringent MSU 
crystals. After a negative gram stain and 36h with negative 
cultures, the knee joint was injected with 40mg of 
methylprednisolone, given limited treatment options otherwise 
(NSAIDs, colchicine suboptimal due to ESRD, systemic prednisone 
suboptimal due to hypertension and fluid overload). Knee X-ray 
showed enlarged joint space and diffuse small lucencies 
throughout visualized bones, with periarticular spurring. MRI 
was obtained and showed changes consistent with osteopenia with 
no concern for malignancy.

# Acute-on-chronic normocytic anemia:
Likely in the setting of ESRD. No evidence of hemolytic anemia. 
Guaiac negative x3. Received 2U of pRBCs for nadir Hgb of 6.6 
for Hgb threshold of 9 per nephrology, with appropriate 
improvement in Hgb. Continued ferrous sulfate 325 mg daily.

# Thrombocytopenia: Platelet count nadired in the 130s, likely 
due to physiologic stress and brief antibiotic treatment on 
admission, normalized prior to discharge without dedicated 
intervention.

# Acute-on-chronic kidney injury (stage V):
Mild elevation of BUN/Cr compared to baseline. At baseline, she 
has declined HD in the past. Most likely cardiorenal in 
etiology, given severe diastolic dysfunction and fluid overload 
on exam in the setting of severe hypertension. FeUrea consistent 
with intrinsic renal disease, which is expected given her stage 
V chronic kidney injury. Nephrology consulted, and patient did 
not need urgent dialysis. Cr remained 4.3 at discharge, likely 
her new baseline in the setting of diuresis.

# Strep bovis bacteriuria: She was found to have asymptomatic 
Strep bovis bacteriuria without pyuria. Antibiotic treatment was 
deferred due to absence of symptoms and lack of clear true UTI. 

CHRONIC ISSUES
# CAD
- continued aspirin 81 mg daily
- continued pravastatin 20 mg qPM
- continued isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg daily

# T2DM
- Humalog insulin sliding scale and glargine 10 units qhs
- held glipizide and sitagliptin

# GERD
- continued pantoprazole 40 mg q24h

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
# Patient was started on amlodipine 5mg PO daily and home 
Isosorbide Mononitrate (Extended Release) was increased from 60 
mg to 90 mg daily, with good BP response. Target diastolic BPs 
given CAD and ESRD is >50.
# Patient was started on torsemide 20mg PO daily. ___ require 
uptitration when patient back to regular PO intake at home. 
Please monitor volume status and adjust dose of diuretics as 
needed.
# Simple bilateral renal cysts were incidentally noted on renal 
ultrasound.
# Patient diagnosed with first episode of gout, may require 
urate lowering agent if she develops another episode.
# F/U SPEP/UPEP which was still pending at time of discharge.
# Suggest further evaluation of chronic anemia; note that 
colonoscopy in ___ was inadequate for screening, and she could 
benefit from another colonoscopy if amenable, especially in 
light of Strep bovis bacteriuria, potentially fecal contaminant, 
but clinical significance of which is uncertain.
# Patient was noted to have an elevated protein to creatinine 
ratio of 8.2, please follow up on this issue and consider 
further management per primary nephrologist.
# She does not carry a diagnosis of COPD, but was found to have 
hyperinflation on CXR; could benefit from PFTs as an outpatient.
# New creatinine baseline 4.3.
# Dry weight: 55.3 Kg
# She was given lab script at discharge for reevaluation of CBC 
and chemistries/renal function.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you. You were admitted to the 
___ because you were short of 
breath and your blood pressure was very elevated. This was 
thought to be related to a large amount of fluid that your body 
had accumulated because of your heart failure and your kidney 
problems. We gave you the same medication in your water pills at 
home, but in intravenous form, which helped improve your 
breathing and lower your blood pressure. We also made changes to 
your home blood pressure medication regimen to ensure that your 
blood pressure remains under control.

While you were in the hospital, you developed right knee pain 
and swelling. We took a small sample of the fluid in your knee 
and analyzed it and found out that you had condition known as 
gout. Gout is due to crystals accumulating in your joints. You 
were treated with a steroid injection in the knee with good 
results. 

Wishing you a speedy recovery,
Your ___ Care Team

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: ___ y/o female with a PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and breast 
cancer who presented to the ED s/p mechanical fall and was found 
to be hypoxic.   
.  
# s/p mechanical fall: In the emergency department the patient 
had a plain film done of her left hip as well as CT scan of the 
pelvis which showed no evidence of fracture. She did have some 
initial improvement in her hip pain with addition of Percocet 
and tramadol as needed, however still had some unsteadiness on 
her feet due to pain. The physical therapy team evaluated her 
and felt that she would be safest to go to a rehabilitation 
facility to rebuild her strength before going home. She 
continued to improve with each physical therapy session.
.
# Hypoxia: The patient was noted to have an O2 sat of <85% on RA 
on the ED and was started on 4L O2 NC. This was then weaned to 
2L. On room air she repeatedly had O2 sats between 85-88% and 
<88% upon ambulation on room air. Upon review of the records 
this appears to be a common occurrence upon hospitalization that 
she has been hypoxic and requiring oxygen. She however, has been 
completely asymptomatic related to this. She had a CTA which 
showed no evidence of PE, but did show evidence of diffuse 
emphysema which was in accordance with what was seen on prior 
CTA a year ago. As a result she was scheduled for follow-up in 
___ clinic with Dr. ___ at the end of ___. She 
remained asymptomatic throughout her hospital stay.
.  
# UTI: Pt was asymptomatic, however had a urinalysis revealing 
many WBCs in her urine upon arrival to the emergency department. 
She was initially treated with levofloxacin and then switched to 
ciprofloxacin for a total of a three day course. She would 
benefit from repeat U/A and culture after discharge given a 
history of frequent UTIs in the past and episode of urosepsis on 
past admission requiring ICU care.
.  
# Acute renal failure: Pt with a rise in creatinine from 1.0 to 
1.3 on day of discharge. Her HCTZ was held and she was 
encouraged to drink plenty of liquids. This level should be 
checked upon discharge and she may need IV hydration if unable 
to take enough po for likely prerenal etiology.
.
# HTN: She had good blood pressure control with SBPs in 
120s-140. She was continued on home amlodipine, metoprolol and 
valsartan. 
.  
# Type II DM: She was continued on her home dose of glipizide 
and monitored with Humalog sliding scale infrequently as needed.

bradyarrhythmia by the way it presented. Clinical presentation 
not suggestive of VF/VT. Patient has EKG showing bradycardia 
with normal PR and initially had ___ second pauses on telemetry 
at ___. Patient was on beta-blocker and calcium 
___ blocker that could have influenced her heart rate. No 
sign of tachycardia to suggest SSS or brady-tachyarrhytmnia

show any fracture, but showed degenerative changes. Your pain 
improved with pain medications and was better off them upon 
discharge. You will need to follow up with your primary care, 
Dr. ___ that. If you are still having pain 1 week 
from now, please call his office.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ F with history of CKD, dementia, HTN, DMII, presenting from 
clinic with worsening hypertension, altered mental status and 
acute renal failure.

# Delirium - the patient was found to be delirious on admission. 
 Initial workup, including blood work, cultures and head CT scan 
was negative.  A paronychia of her right large toe was found 
which was drained; pain from the paronychia may have contributed 
to her initial delirium. Geriatrics was consulted, and the 
patient received supportive measures such as better pain 
control, a bowel regimen and attempts to preserve her sleep wake 
cycle.  She was agitated at times, and responded poorly to 
olanzapine but did improve with daily seroquel 6.25 at night, 
which was later increased to 12.5 to help improve her sleep/wake 
cycle.  A urinalysis was later re-checked which did demonstrate 
a urinary tract infection and she was treated with IV 
ceftriaxone for 3 days. Finally, her delirium might have been 
worsened by constipation, which was treated with disimpaction.

# Urinatry tract infection - treated as above.

# Hypertension - the patient had a blood pressure elevated with 
systolic pressures in the 200s at clinic prior to admission.  
She was continued on valsartan and amlodipine, and hydralazine 
10mg bid was added to her regimen, resulting in good blood 
pressure control.

# Diabetes - the patient was not on any oral anti-hyperglycemics 
on admission as her PCP had discontinued these 3 weeks prior.  
She was started on a humalog sliding scale and lantus.

#Acute renal failure - This resolved quickly with IV fluids. 

#Code status: The patient was confirmed to be DNR/DNI with the 
family.

#Transition of care issues: Geriatrics recommended discontinuing 
the rosuvastatin and omeprazole if they are not needed.  This 
should be discussed with the patient's primary care provider.

experienced some nausea and emesis which was controlled with 
zofran.  Stem cell transplant was performed. Her course was 
complicated by neutropenic fever and she was treated with 
antibiotics. She remained culture negative. She developed 
esophagitis and was found to be negative for CMV but esophaheal 
biopsy suggested esophageal GHVD and also had evidence of skin 
GHVD. She received a tapered course of steroids and improved. 
She also developed intense headaches while she was 
thrombocytopenic. Head CT showed no acute intracranial 
hemorrhage or mass effect, with a few vague dense areas noted in 
the brainstem/posterior fossa, likely being artifactual. Her 
headaches resolved. She was discharged to the oncology 
apartments and will follow closely with the ___ and 
her primary oncologist.

#. Hypertension.  On admission, patients metoprolol was 
continued but her valsartan was held out of concern for renal 
toxicity with chemotherapy.  Her blood pressure trended up 
during her conditioning and her metoprolol dose was increased. 
Subsequently nifedipine was also added and she was discharged on 
nifedpine and metoprolol with good blood pressure control. She 
had serial EKGs performed given her cardiac history, and her 
cardiac status should continue to be monitored as an outpatient.

cultures, and clostridium difficile toxin.  Due to her 
continuing diarrhea, CT abdomen done on HD3 which showed 
uncomplicated ileocolitis with continuous involvement of distal 
ileum up to proximal transverse colon just beyond the hepatic 
flexure, suggestive of graft versus host disease or 
infectious/inflammatory etiologies.  The pt. was placed NPO on 
HD3 for colonoscopy, but given her poor PO intake while in the 
hospital, was evaluated and started on TPN by HD4.   While on

as medications for possible Graft Versus Host Disease of the 
colon.  You were evaluated by colon specialists 
(gastroenterologists) who performed a procedure to look at the 
inside of you colon and take biopsies (colonoscopy).  It was 
determined that your diarrhea was NOT from an infection, but due 
to Graft-Versus-Host-Disease (a complication that can happen in 
people with allogenic stem cell transplants).  You were placed 
on large doses of immunosuppressants (Methylprednisolone, 
Cyclosporin, Mycophenolate Mofetil, and Budenoside) to stop your 
immune system from attacking your colon.  Your diarrhea began to 
improve, you were placed on a full low bacteria diet, and 
discharged from the hospital.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with CML, s/p allogeneic SCT D 163 (on discharge) with 
post-transplant period complicated by upper and lower GI GVH 
(biopsy ___, s/p treatment with steroids, currently on 
cyclosporin 50 in am, 25 in pm and atovaquone, who presents with 
persistent nausea, vomitting, and diarrhea. Anemic on 
presentation and transfused 2 units of RCC and following a 
seemingly inadequate response on lab tests received a further 2 
units. Started on IV methylprednisolone for ? GVHD and converted 
to an oral steroid taper. Cyclosporin level increased due to low 
level. Deranged LFTs noted and will be repeated in community. 
Found to have an enterobacter UTI and commenced on a 3 days 
course of oral levofloxacin.
.
#Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea: Presented with 5 days of 
symptoms which were improving on admission. For concerns of GVHD 
(see previous history) she was started on IV methylprednisolone 
30mg bid and this was converted to an oral prednisone taper 
following resolution of symptoms by the day after admission. PRN 
ondansetron for nausea. She was found to have moderate LeukE on 
UA although there were only 3WBCs on urine microscopy. She was 
commenced on a 3-day course of oral levofloxacin for her UTI 
(note sensitive to ciprofloxacin on sensitivity testing). Stool 
cultures were negative.
.
#Anemia: She was noted to have a Hb/Hct of 7.1/20.2 in clinic 
and was transfused 2 units RCC. Post transfusion HCt was only 
20.5 (cause unclear) and she received a further 2 units RCC with 
post transfusion labs Hb 9.9 HCt 29.1. Retic count was suitably 
elevated for degree of anemia and other hemolysis screen was 
negative.

q8 and atovaquone [Mepron] 750 mg/5 mL Suspension 10 ml by mouth 
daily. Will follow with Dr ___ on ___.
.
# Possible GVHD: Her symptoms were thought to perhaps represent 
mild GVHD although the presence of a UTI may be the cause. She 
was started on a IV methylprednisolone and converted to an oral 
steroid taper. Her cyclosporin dose was increased to 50mg am 
75mg pm following a low cyclosporin level of <30. Continued 
budesonide.
.
#Elevated LFTs: She was noted to have deranged LFTs on admission 
which were not present on previous laboratory testing. There was 
evidence of a transaminitis and increased during admission. She 
will have her blood repeated on ___ with results faxed to Dr 
___.
.
# Likely peripheral neuropathy: Tingling in hands and feet, 
absent AJs and decreased temp sensation to mid shins 
bilaterally. Likely secondary to chemo.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old woman with CML, s/p MRD allo SCT ___ with 
Busulfan/Cyclophosphamide. Her post-transplant course was 
complicated with GVH of the upper and lower GI tract that 
required hopitalization for IV steroids and increased 
immunosuppression. She was admitted for investigation of 
worsening LFTs. She was treated with high dose IV 
methylprednisolone, oral Mycophenolate mofetil and increasing 
cyclosporin doses. She quickly developed symptoms suggestive of 
GI GVHD with cramping ___ pain, nausea and vomiting. LFTs 
worsened during admission but she did not necessitate a liver 
biopsy due to considerable improvement in these following 
increased immunosuppression. The general picture was that of 
severe multi-organ GVHD. Her GI symptoms worsened with abdominal 
pain and profuse watery diarrhea and she had a CT scan which 
demonstrtaed confluent small bowel enteritis. At this point she 
was placed on bowel rest and administered TPN. GVHD was 
confirmed at endoscopy and biopsy where mucosa was noted to be 
friable and extensively ulcerated in keeping with severe GVHD. 
Her cyclosporin was titrated up and her symptoms improved 
although diarrhea persisted despite a considerable period of 
bowel rest on TPN. Her Hb/HCt had been slowly falling and her 
stool was found to be guaiac +ve felt likely 2o to her bowel 
inflammation. She was found to have a swollen left arm shortly 
after a PICC line was placed and there was evidence of an 
extensive LUE DVT extending to the subclavian vein. This was 
treated conservatively as anticoagulation was felt to be 
inadvisable in the setting of her continued bowel inflamation 
and guaiac +ve stools. Due to problmes of low cyclosporin levels 
her cyclosporina nd mycophenolate were changed to IV on ___. 
WBC count progressively dropped ? cause and she may need a bone 
marrow biopsy soon if her counts do not improve. She was 
continued on IV methylprednisolone mycophenolate and cyclosporin 
w/continued TPN for bowel rest. Blood glucoses high and 
titrating up insulin in TPN in addition to addingNPH low dose 
BID on ___. Gradually, diarrhea improved and pt was able to be 
transitioned slowly to PO medications. Levels of cyclosporin 
were monitored to ensure therapuetic range and absorptions. 
Slowly pt's diet was also advanced and at discharge pt was off 
TPN. Closes follow-up was planned on ___.
.
# Rising LFTs:  This was found to be liver GVHD.  Progressively 
settling following GVHD treatment. Mildly elevated on previous 
admission in week prior to current admission. She was initially 
asymptomatic although latterly developed severe diarrhea, nausea 
and vomiting. Her steroids initially oral prednisone were 
increased to IVMP 30mg bid and cyclosporin was gradually 
uptitrated. She had ___ U/S ___ which showed focal fatty 
infiltrate and nil else. Bil rose from 1.6 on ___ and 
transaminases were progressively rising. MRCP on ___ showed 
hemosiderosis of liver and spleen, thickening of duodenum and 
___ jejunum in keeping with inflammatory/infectious etiology 
and a small stone in GB. Seen by hepatology ___ and lab 
investigations for vit D,  Hep B/C/Adeno/CMV/HHV6/EBV PCRs, Hep 
A Ab, HSV Ab. These all came back -ve save vit D level which was 
low and seh was sterted on vitamin D supplementation. Put on 
bowel rest and started on TPN. Bil rose from 1.6 to 5.7 on ___ 
with improved transaminases. By repeat on ___ Bil level had 
dropped to 5.1 and by ___ Bil dropped to 2.9 with improved 
transaminases. She therefore did not go for liver bx. LFTs 
continued to trend down with high levels of immunosuppression. 
Slowly immunosuppression was titrated down and LFTs remained 
stable as diarrhea continued to improve. Transition to PO 
fluconazole resulted in rise in LFTs w/out evidence of other 
worsening GVHD symptoms so pt was restarted on home 
voriconazole. LFTs will continued to be monitored as meds are 
titrated on an outpt basis.
.
# CML: s/p allo SCT. She continues to recover from her 
transplant. Guaiac +ve stol ___ and transfused 1 unit 
___. Transfusion goal HCt >25 Plt >20. 
.
# GVHD ___ pain, nausea and  vomiting and elevated LFTs): 
Previous significant upper and lower GI GVHD. She ws found on 
this admission to again have severe GVHD in his case involving 
the small bowel and liver. On admission she was started on IV 
methylpred 30mg bid. Whilst she was asymptomatic on admission, 
she quickly developed abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting felt 
likely to be GVHD. Increased cyclosporin to 75mg bid, added 
mycophenolate 500mg bid and voriconazole 200mg bid on ___. 
Increased mycophenolate to 1g bid on ___. Cyclosporin 119 and 
increased cyclosporin to 100mg bid ___ then 125mg bid ___. As 
high level changed to 125/100 on ___. Cyclopsorin increased to 
125mg bid ___ and 150mg bid ___ due to persistently low 
levels and felt that this was likely due to poor absorption from 
the gut. SShe had suprapubic tenderness with diarrhea as of ___ 
- NOT peritonitic. Initially felt to be ? inadequately treated 
UTI (Enterobacter in UCx in week prior and Rx levo for 3 days). 
Rpt UA and UCx were -ve. Started on oral cipro ___.. Due to 
diarrhea was changed to IV cipro/metronidazole ___. MRI showed 
duodenitis/jejunitis ? infectious ? inflammatory. Supportive IV 
fluids where given and then TPN was started for nutritional 
support. High stool output. Seen by GI ___ who recommended 
stool studies which were negative. Changed Abx to IV meropenem 
___. ___ ___ showed small bowel enteritis 
encompassing most of small bowel with no dilatation. UGIE and bx 
___ showed abnormal, friable mucosa throughout approximately 
75% of the duodenum which was denuded with a shiny erythematous 
base and could be consistent with known history of GVHD. IV 
meropenem stopped ___. Awaiting CMV immunostaining. EBV 20 
copies and was repeated ___ and was not amplifyable although 
the sample was slightly hemolysed. She symptomatically improved 
although had persistent diarrhea despite bowel rest. She was 
treated with loperamide. Gradually symptoms improved and pt was 
able to be transition from IV meds to PO meds and diet advanced 
slowly while TPN continued until pt was able to tolerated PO 
diet at a sufficient level to maintain calorie needs. At time of 
d/c TPN had been stopped and pt was taking only POs.
.

# L UE DVT: Swollen L arm post PICC insertion. Had U/S and 
doppler ___ which showed edema but no hematoma or localised 
edema but repeat U/S showed Left Basilic DVT ___.  PICC was 
removed on ___. She did not receive anticoagulation given low 
Plts, guaiac +ve stool and significant ulceration on bx 
suggestive of continued significant bowel inflammation. Later pt 
had some intermittent residual swelling in the arm which was 
attibutated to mild edema because of lingering partial occlusion 
in the veins. Repeat US was negative at that time.
.
Recommend considering chelation therapy for treatment of iron 
overload. Monitor nutritional status and PO intake as well as GI 
symptoms of GVHD

Imaging:

IMPRESSION: 
 CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 5:43 ___ 
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma. 
2. Left lower lobe consolidation with adjacent small left 
nonhemorrhagic 
pleural effusion. This finding is concerning for infection in 
the appropriate clinical setting. 
3. Increased attenuation of the liver, compatible with 
hemosiderosis, 
unchanged. 
4. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis. 
5. Extensive calcified atherosclerotic disease of the aorta and 
its branches without associated aneurysmal changes. 
6. Right thigh lipoma is partially imaged. 
.
EMG:
IMPRESSION: 
Abnormal study. There is electrophysiologic evidence for a 
myopathy with 
denervating (""inflammatory"") features, most severely affecting 
the lower 
extremities. The findings are not suggestive of an acquired 
demyelinating 
polyneuropathy, such as Guillain- ___ syndrome. 
.
ECHO ___: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial 
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated 
right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are 
normal (LVEF >55%). A mid-cavitary gradient is identified. There 
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the 
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, no 
change. 
.
CHEST CT: report pending at time of discharge
. 
PATHOLOGY:
Muscle biopsy, r4 rectus femoris muscle:
Inflammatory myopathy, see note.
Note: Section showed myofibers with prominent inflammatory 
infiltrate composed of foamy macrophages, lymphocytes, and 
plasma cells.  Degenerative and regenerative fibers are seen.  
In some areas, myofibers are replaced by adipose and connective 
tissue, consistent with a subacute clinical picture. CD3 labeled 
prominent T cell infiltrate with numerous CB8 positive cytotoxic 
and scattered CD4 positive helper cells, while CD20 labeled B 
lymphocytes are rare in perivascular zones. CD68 highlighted 
abundant macrophages, some involved in myophagocytosis. The 
findings would be consistent with GVH myositis in the clinical 
context of CML status post alloSCT and history of GI and liver 
GVH disease. GVH myositis is indistinguishable histologically 
from sporatic polymyositis. Further studies including 
biochemical panel will be reported as an addendum.
.
R forearm: pending at time of discharge

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ female with CAD s/p CABG, accelerated phase CML s/p 
allo SCT ___ complicated by upper and lower GI GVHD ___ 
and liver GVHD ___ presenting from OSH electively intubated 
for hypoxic and hypercarbic failure in the setting of myopathy. 
.
# Hypercarbic hypoxic respiratory failure: Pt was initially 
electively intubated given diffuse myopathy affecting 
respiratory muscles. Pt was managed on endotracheal intubation 
for 11 days before being trached on ___. Her ___ NIF has 
remained (-14)-(-18). During trials on trach collar, she has 
maintained her oxygen saturation and respiratory rate, however 
her blood pressure elevates and she reports subjective feelings 
of dyspnea and fatigue. Goal now for weaning her from the vent 
is treatment of her diffuse myositis to improve respiratory 
failure in the long term with gentle weaning to trach collar.
.
# Motor weakness: Based on muscle biopsy, inflammation is 
consistent with GVHD.  Muscle biopsy shows impressive 
inflammation despite having been on steriods prior to biopsy. 
Muscle strength appeared to initially improve on steroids, 
though now has been stable x 1 week. Following muscle biopsy, 
she was started on cyclosporine 25mg IV BID and received 1 dose 
of IVIG. She has had minimal improvement in her strength and is 
aware that this will be a prolonged recovery process.
.
# Mold on BAL: Sparse growth seen on bronchial aspirate from 
___. Given clinical improvement and radiological improvement 
on CT scan ___, we do not feel that this is likely a pathogenic 
organism. We do recommend repeat CT chest in ___ weeks for 
continued monitoring. 
.
# depression: Ms ___ has started to appear overwhelmed and 
frustrated by her current condition and long term recovery that 
is necessary. We have deferred starting an SSRI but this should 
be reconsidered outside of an acute hospitalization.
.
# Pancytopenia: Developed in setting of starting cyclosporine. 
Her CBC has been stable and she has not required any recent 
transfusions. Threshold for transfusion would be platelets <10, 
hct <25
.
# bilateral hand bullae: First noticed on ___. Dermatology was 
consulted and felt that her purpura was due to trauma and her 
coagulopathy.  The bullae were probably the result of hemorrhage 
into thin skin. They were drained and per derm, continued with 
light pressure dressings to prevent re-accumulation.
.
# Hypertension: Pt has history of hypertension and had been 
managed at home on amlodipine 5mg, and metoprolol succinate 
300mg ___. These were initially held on presentation, but 
resumed as she improved clinically. She has been stable on 
amlodipine 5mg ___, metoprolol tartrate 100mg q6hr, and 
captopril 12.5mg TID. She has been noted to get hypertensive to 
170s when on trach collar. We would expect this to resolve as 
she becomes more comfortable on the trach collar and her 
strength improves. It would be possible to up titrate her 
captopril if she requires.
.
# DVT: Pt has bilateral DVT, however in setting of diffuse 
ecchymoses and hematomas, heparin drip was held. Pt had CTA at 
outside hospital to r/o PE and had an IVC filter placed.  She 
was placed on compression stockings to avoid further 
complications of thrombophlebitis.
.
# Elevated LFTs: LFT have been stably elevated during this 
hospitalization, likely secondary to her known GVHD.
.
# elevated PTT: Unclear etiology since patient has been off 
heparin drip for 1 week now. She is still getting heparin SQ TID 
and suspect that given decreased muscle mass, she may be 
supratheraputic from SQ heparin alone. Further work up is 
pending, including ___, anti-cardiolipin antibody, and 
anti-lupus antibody.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
.
# CML s/p allogeneic stem cell tx: Pt was continued on acyclovir 
and atovaquone for prophylaxis. She had been on budesonide, 
however this has been held recent as it cannot be given through 
her dobhoff. She has been started on cyclosporin and IVIG for 
diffuse myositis.
.
# CAD: s/p CABG in ___. Continued home medications. Repeat ECHO 
here showed no wall motion abnormalities. She also had cardiac 
catheterization at outside hospital for workup of initial 
presenting dyspnea which revealed clean coronary arteries.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
Pt is full code.
.
She will require repeat IVIG either ___ or ___ per 
rheumatology recs.
.
She should have repeat CT chest in ___ weeks for follow up on 
interval change in L infiltrate.
.
We have decreased her heparin SQ to BID given persistently 
elevated PTT. This should be re-evaluated if remains elevated 
and further work-up would be warranted.
.
We have resumed home blood pressure medications. If necessary, 
her captopril could be up titrated.
.
Patient and her husband are aware that she will have a prolonged 
recovery period. She has expressed some thoughts of depression 
and would likely benefit from an SSRI.
.
Tube feds currently Beneprotein, 21 gm/day, Goal rate: 40 ml/hr, 
Residual Check: q4h Hold feeding for residual >= : 200 ml
.
Pt has not been getting her budesonide as it clogs her dobhoff. 
This should be discussed with hem/onc at her follow up visit.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___. You were admitted for difficulty breathing and 
had a breathing tube placed to help. This was transitioned to a 
tracheostomy. You had a muscle biopsy done to determine what 
caused your weakness. It looks like your graft versus host 
disease caused damage to your muscle and affected your 
respiratory muscles. You were started on a new medicine called 
cyclosporin and got 1 dose of IVIG to treat the muscle weakness. 
You were also continued on steroids. There was some concern for 
a pneumonia, though this looks like it has resolved on your most 
recent CT scan. Your feeding tube was left in place for you to 
get adequate nutrition until your muscle strength improves.

We will send a complete list of your medications to the ___.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with a history of 
accelerated CML s/p allo-MRD SCT ___ complicated by GVHD of 
the liver, gut, myositis necessitating intubation due to 
respiratory muscle weakness.  She presented with worsening 
blood-streaked diarrhea and elevated LFTs, with hospitalization 
complicated by multiple DVTs and resulting BRBPR caused by 
heparin gtt, with BRBPR, and recurrent C. diff infection.
.
#. DIARRHEA: ___ GVHD and recurrent C diff. Patient has been 
having blood-streaked diarrhea since admission likely secondary 
to GVHD, which progressed to BRBPR with clots after starting 
heparin gtt for DVTs (see below). Heparin was discontinued, but 
patient with continued diarrhea. On ___ C. diff toxin was 
found positive. Pt has had multiple episodes of C diff in past, 
and prophylactic PO vanco had been discontinued on ___. She 
was started on IV flagyl on ___ for her positive C diff), then 
switched to vanco 500mg PO q6hrs per GI recs (used for recurrent 
c diff: 250-500mg PO q6hrs x14 days, then taper). Diarrhea 
progressively improved after this. Patient also has chronic gut 
and liver GVHD. She had EGD and colonoscopy on ___, which 
showed 2 whitish cecal plaques/nodules with biopsy showing focal 
active ileitis, rare apoptotic crypt cells in 
ileum/ascending/transverse colon consistent with (but not 
specific for) GVHD. Also had ileocecal valve nodules composed of 
""predominantly fibrinopurulent exudate consistent with ulcer and 
a very minute strip of surface epithelium"". EGD/colonoscopy 
biopsies were found negative for AFB, fungi, CMV, viruses. For 
her C diff, patient is discharged on Vancomycin 500mg PO q6 
hours for 14 days (first day = ___, last day = ___. After 
this, she should restart suppressive therapy: vancomycin 250mg 
q6 hours chronically. For her GVHD, she is discharged on 
prednisone 30mg by mouth daily, and cyclosporine 50mg by mouth 
twice daily. 
.
#. BRBPR: pt admitted with blood-streaked stools, found likely 
secondary to GVHD (confirmed by colonoscopy on ___. When 
heparin gtt was started for multiple ___ DVTs, patient developed 
frank BRBPR with clots. This resolved after discontinuing 
heparin gtt; patient guaiac negative afterward. She was started 
on enoxaparin 40mg BID for DVT prophylaxis with no ensuing 
complications.   
.
#. ELEVATED LFTs: Patient has known GVHD of the liver.  LFTs on 
admission showed elevated AST, ALT and Alk Phosph, found likely

Bone Marrow Bx 
HYPOCELLULAR BONE MARROW WITH TRILINEAGE HEMATOPOIESIS AND 
DECREASED MEGAKARYOCYTES.  NO MORPHOLOGIC EVIDENCE OF 
TRANSFORMATION OR HEMOPHAGOCYTIC SYNDROME ARE SEEN.  SEE NOTE.

Note: The findings overall suggest marrow suppression, perhaps 
related to TKIs, rather than hemophagocytic syndrome, i.e. there 
are only occasional hemophagocytic macrophages present, with 
hemosiderin-laden macrophages predominating, and no overt marrow 
""damage"" seen. 

Colon Bx:
Random colon, mucosal biopsies:
Colonic mucosa with focal crypt atrophy and dropout with rare 
basal crypt epithelial cell apoptoses consistent with graft 
versus host disease in the appropriate clinical setting; no 
viral cytopathic effect seen; see note.
Note: Given rare neutrophilic crypt abscesses, a concomitant 
acute infectious process cannot entirely be excluded. 
Immunostain for cytomegalovirus is in progress and will be 
reported in an addendum.
ADDENDUM #1: 
Immunostain for cytomegalovirus is negative with satisfactory 
controls.
ADDENDUM #2:
Immunostain for herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 is negative with 
satisfactory controls.

Renal Bx:
KIDNEY (LEFT), CORE BIOPSY:

1.THROMBOTIC MICROANGIOPATHY, SEE NOTE.2.SEVERE INTERSTITIAL 
FIBROSIS AND TUBULAR ATROPHY.
Note: The biopsy shows striking acute and chronic thrombotic 
microangiopathy involving arterioles and glomeruli.  The biopsy 
also shows advanced scarring of the tubulointerstitial 
compartment (70-80% of the cortical area).

Imaging:
CT abd/pelvis ___
 
IMPRESSION: 
  
1.No wall thickening or pneumatosis concerning for colitis.    
  
2.Small amount of non-hemorrhagic intraperitoneal fluid. 

MRI C spine ___
IMPRESSION:  No cord compression or abnormal enhancement within 
the spinal canal.  Mild-to-moderate degenerative changes. 

MRI Head ___
IMPRESSION:  No acute infarcts, mass effect, hydrocephalus or 
abnormal 
enhancement.  Mild changes of small vessel disease.  Mucosal 
thickening left maxillary sinus and soft tissue changes in 
bilateral mastoids.

Renal US:
IMPRESSION: 
  
1. No evidence of hydronephrosis, stones, or focal renal 
lesions. 
2. Ascites. 

CT Chest ___
IMPRESSION: 
  
1.  Scattered small ground-glass and ___ opacities in 
the upper lobes could represent atypical infection, as 
suspected, or inflammation. 
  
2.  4 mm right upper lobe nodule is new since ___ 
and likely also infectious or inflammatory; this may be 
reassessed for resolution on follow-up imaging. 
  
3.  Hyperdense liver and spleen, similar to prior, likely due to 

hemosiderosis.  
  

Right lower extremity venous ultrasound ___:
Partial thrombus in the proximal right superficial femoral vein 
is relatively unchanged compared to the prior examination 
without evidence of DVT progression.   

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is ___ with accelerated CML s/p allo transplant 
___ complicated by GVHD, pneumonia, myositis, and DVTs who 
initially presented with fatigue, diarrhea, pancytopenia in the 
setting of Cellcept and Ponatinib therapy.

# Diarrhea: Patient presented with 4 weeks of watery diarrhea 
with ___ bowel movements daily and poor appetite. Symptoms were 
most likely secondary to cellcept toxcity or ponatinib toxicity. 
Colon biopsy results were consisted with shallow crypts that are 
typically seen with GVHD or cellcept toxicity. While GVHD is a 
possible etiolgy, chronic GVHD is much less likely to present 
with acute diarrhea. An extensive infectious work up including 
norovirus, CMV, cdiff, adenovirus, parvovirus, HHV6, and O&P 
were negative. Ms. ___ improved with decreased cellcept 
dosing. She was transitioned from 1000mg BID to ___ BID at 
time of discharge. She continues to have ___ loose bowel 
movements daily. However, she continues to trend in a positive 
direction at the time of discharge. She did require 2 weeks of 
TPN but is now tolerating a PO diet at the time of discharge.

# Pancytopenia: Pt was noted to have progressive pancytopenia on 
outpatient labs over weeks preceeding admission. Pancytopenia is 
thought to be secondary to ponatinib toxicity as all cell lines 
improved after holding drug. Ms. ___ has experienced 
pancytopenia on previous TKI treatments as well. She was also 
transitioned from bactrim to atovaquone for PCP ___. A 
bone morrow biopsy was hypocellular but without concern for 
recurrent CML. A Graft chimerism study notable for 100% donor. 
Pt did also have HSV oral lesion and there may have been a 
component of HSV marrow suppression as her counts also improved 
with acyclovir therapy. Ponatinib is held at the time of 
discharge.

# Nephrotic syndrome:  The patient presented with acute on 
chronic CKD with creatinine around 2 this admission. Her 
creatinine has been gradually uptrending over the last year. It 
was never worked up and thought to be secondary to TKI therapy. 
She was found to have 4+ proteinuria this admission with low 
serum albumin and elevated triglycerides. A  renal biopsy was 
notable for acute on chronic microangiopathic disease, 
glomerular sclerosing and fibrosis of kidney. Etiology of 
changes remains unclear but differential is broad including 
effects of TKI treatment. There was no hydro or obtruction on 
renal us. Complement levels were normal and no serum 
cyroglobins. She was started on losartan 100mg daily and 
lisinopril 5mg for proteinuria. Pt was also started on aggresive 
IV diuresis for anasarca with improvement in fluid status. She 
will be discharged on 40mg PO Lasix with goal of maintaining 
within 2kg of her discharge weight, which was 143.6 lbs. 
Creatinine was stable around 2 at time of discharge. 

#Dyspnea: Patient promoted dyspnea during admission but never 
developed hypoxia. Symptoms were initially thought to be 
secondary to pulmonary edema and did improve with initial 
diuresis. However, symptoms did not completely resolve. A CT 
Chest was notable for some scattered ground glass opacities and 
a 4 mm right upper lobe nodule. PFTS show mixed obstructive and 
restrictive physiology. Fungal work up unrevealing. Pulmonology 
recommended a course of azithromycin for atypical pneumonia with 
follow up CT scan in 1 month. Dyspnea continued to improve at 
time of discharge following course of azithromycin. She was also 
started on pulmonary prophylaxis with FAM: daily fluticasone, 
azithromycin 3x/wk, monteleukast every other day.

#R lower extremity pain: Pt noted to have partial DVT of right 
superficial femoral vein which is unchanged from prev study in 
___ and most likely represents remnent from previous distal 
DVT which were treated with 6 months of anticoagulation. 
Vascular surg evaluated vascular appearing lesion on right lower 
extreity and are uncertain regarding etiology. ___ be secondary 
to smaller superficial thrombi in smaller leg veins. Recommend 
continued warm compresses, compression,and elevation of leg. 
Further anticoagulation at prophylactic dosing should be 
discussed as an outpatient once platlets are stable.

# Seizure like activity: Pt has 3 episodes of right neck 
twitching and mental status changes on ___ which appeared 
seizure like to staff. There was no tongue biting or generalized 
activity. An MRI Head was normal and LP without concern for 
bacterial infection. Viral cultures were all negative from CSF. 
An EEG was notable for encephalopathy without epileptical 
discharges. Pt experienced no further concerning neurologic 
changes following ___.

# HSV:Pt promoted oral pain on admission and was found to have 
several ulcerative lesions. An oral swab of lesions was positive 
for HSV. Symptoms and ulcers improved on acyclovir. She will 
continue prophylactic dosing as an outpatient.

#CML: Ms. ___ is status ___ allogenic transplant in ___ 
with recurrent disease in late ___. Disease has currently been 
well controlled on ponatinib with BCR-ABL PCR .09. However,has 
now been discontinued as drug toxicity outweighing benefits of 
treatment. As noted above, repeat bone marrow bx this admission 
without concern for recurrent disease. Chimerism study showed 
100% donor.

# GVHD: Has had GI  and skin involvement in past in addition to 
myositis. Has been well controlled on current MMF and prednisone 
dosing. While there was initial concern for GVHD as etiology to 
current presentation, it is uncommon to have diarrhea with 
chronic GVHD. Cellcept and prednisone doses were decreased this 
admission. She will need to closely monitor with recent decrease 
in immunosuppresion. 

#HTN: Ms. ___ had poorly controlled hypertension this 
admission. Most likely related to pregressive kidney disease. 
She was started on losartan, which was uptitrated to 100mg with 
good BP control by discharge.

#Hypogammablobulinemia: Likely ___ nephrotic syndrome and 
protein wasting. At admission, IgG level was 82 and she received 
an IVIg transfusion at 0.4g/kg. On ___, she received a second 
IVIg transfusion at the same dose for an IGg level of 300. 
During the second transfusion, she had some mild upper back pain 
and chills, which resolved with slowing the infusion.

___ EBV negative
___ Mycoplasma negative
___ BK Virus negative
___ stool cultures negative
___ CMV PCR negative
___ BCR/ABL gene rearrangement 2.013

IMAGING:
EGD ___ Normal
Flex Sig ___ Normal

Renal US ___
Tiny echogenic focus noted in the left kidney, perhaps a small 
AML or a calcified lesion unlikely to be of clinical 
consequence, but otherwise normal renal ultrasound. 

CT Sinus ___
Mucosal thickening in the maxillary sinuses, worse on the left.  
Opacification of the right sphenoid sinus.  Small polyps in the 
right posterior middle nasal turbinate and right pharynx.  The 
ostiomeatal units are patent. 

Gastric Empyting Study ___
IMPRESSION: Rapid gastric emptying. Note that the patient did 
not consume the full standard meal, making these findings 
difficult to interpret. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o F with hx of accelerated phase CML s/p sibling allo D0 
___ presenting with diarrhea x 4 days and nausea/decreased 
PO intake w/ weight loss over the past 1 month.  

# CML
CML s/p sibling allo D0 ___ complicated by GVHD.  No longer 
on TKI given multiple side effects.  Previous chimerism and 
BCR-ABL gene rearrangement study shows no residual disease 
however repeat test showed increased level of BCR-ABL gene.  
Here mycophenylate was stoooped to increase graft versus. 
leukemia effect.  We continued her current prednisone regiemtn 
15mg alternating with 20mg.  Her acyclovir and atovaquone were 
continued. 

# Nausea/Weight Loss
History of 1 month of worsening nausea and decreased PO intake 
correlated with 5 pound weight loss.  Concern for upper GI GVHD 
given decrease in steroids and nausea.  EGD and flex sig 
negative for signs of GVHD.  Her gastric empyting study was 
inconclusive.  Her symptoms improved with zyprexa and zofran.  
She was able to tolerate a diet at time of discharge and her 
symptoms were well-controlled.
 
# Sinus Congestion
Concern for sinus infection given symptoms and immunocompromised 
state.  CT sinus shows mucosal thickening w/o bone involvement.  
She was started on levofloxacin for a total of 14 days of 
treatment.  Her symptoms were imporved with afrin, flonase, and 
saline irrigation.  She will follow-up in ___ clinic in 1 month.

# Diarrhea
Presents with diarrhea x4 days and overnight had more non-bloody 
watery diearrhea.  Most likely secondary to viral or bacterial 
gastroenteritis.  However could be due to GVHD and recent 
decrease in prednisone dosing. Also could be medication side 
effects from mycophenylate.  On previous admission, had diarrhea 
and her mycophenylate dose was decreasd with improvement in his 
symptoms.  Her TKI was also disconinued during this admission.  
Diarrhea has been improving and flex sig was without signs of 
GVHD.  Stool studies were negative for infection.  On discharge 
her diarrhea had resolved.
 
# Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis 
Elevated bicarb w/ hypercholemia most likely due to combination 
of chronic kidney diease, diarrhea, and NS fluids.  We started 
oral bicarb replacement and her serum bicarb level normalized at 
time of discharge.

# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure
Elevated Cr to 2.6 from baseline 1.9-2.3 likely pre-renal 
etiology secondary to diarrhea and poor PO intake.  Also could 
possibly be due to renal GVHD.  Improved with fluids to 1.8.

# HTN
Her lasix, losartan, metoprolol, and amlodipine were continued.

# CAD
We continued here ASA 81.

IMAGING
-------
TTE ___
IMPRESSION: Hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function. No 
clinically significant valvular regurgitation or stenosis. 
Indeterminate pulmonary artery systolic pressure. Suggestion of 
pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.  Compared with the 
prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the left ventricular 
systolic function is now hyperdynamic (LVEF previously 55-60%). 

Pharmacological Stress MIBI ___
INTERPRETATION: Left ventricular cavity size is normal.  Rest 
and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake 
throughout the left ventricular myocardium.  Gated images reveal 
normal wall motion. Septal wall motion compatible with prior 
CABG.  The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 65% 
post stress.
IMPRESSION: Normal myocardial perfusion study.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis ___
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of PTLD.  
2. Soft tissue nodules in the left lower quadrant most likely 
represent the sequela of subcutaneous injections.

CT Chest ___
IMPRESSION:
1. As compared to ___, no lung nodules have newly 
appeared.  The
pre-existing lung nodules, including the minimal ground-glass 
nodules in the upper lobe, are all constant, unsuspicious in 
morphology.  If the patient is not at high risk for cancer, the 
lesions do not require further followup, given that their 
dimension is below 4 mm.
2.  Status post CABG, no lymphadenopathy, no pleural effusions.

CXR ___
ET tube is in a standard position.  NG tube tip is out of view 
below the 
diaphragm.  Cardiomegaly is stable.  Increasing opacities in the 
right 
perihilar region and right lower lobe are worrisome for 
worsening pneumonia.  Component of pulmonary edema is stable.  
Left lower lobe pneumonia is stable.  There is no pneumothorax 
or large pleural effusion.  There are low lung volumes with 
stable widened mediastinum  due to engorgement of vessels. 

CXR ___:
The patient is currently not intubated.  The right internal 
jugular line tip is at the right atrium and should be pulled 
back approximately 3 cm.  Heart size and mediastinum are stable. 
 Lungs are essentially clear.  No pleural effusion or 
pneumothorax is appreciated, although cannot be entirely 
excluded. 

Muscle Biopsy ___:  Final Report Pending

CT Chest Without Contrast ___:  Newly appeared massive 
bilateral opacities, predominantly ground-glass in attenuation, 
with subtle areas of consolidation.  Accompanying airways 
disease and small pleural effusions with atelectasis. 

EMG ___:  Abnormal study. There is electrophysiologic 
evidence for a moderate, generalized myopathic process with 
denervating features. In addition, the data are suggestive of a 
moderate, generalized, axonal, sensorimotor polyneuropathy. 
Based on the limited repetitive stimulation studies performed, 
there is no evidence for a disorder of neuromuscular junction 
transmission, including myasthenia ___. Compared to the 
previous study dated ___, there has been an improvement 
in motor response amplitudes and worsening in sensory response 
amplitudes.  

 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  

Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o F with history of accelerated phase CML 
s/p sibling allo transplant on ___ complicated by upper and 
lower GI GVHD ___, liver GVHD in setting of reducing 
immunosuppression ___, GVHD related myopathy resulting in 
weakness and respiratory failure ___ who presented for 
presyncope. Her lightheadedness improved significantly with IV 
fluids and she had no further episodes of presyncope. She had 
elevated creatinine above baseline that resolved with IV fluids. 
She was found to have an elevated troponin that trended down 
thought to be likely due to demand ischemia in the setting of 
anemia in addition to poor clearance in the setting of acute on 
chronic kidney injury. Her BCR-ABL load was elevated compared to 
prior levels and her prednisone immunosuppression was decreased 
to improve control of her CML. She was also found to have an 
elevated EBV viral load with concern for PTLD/lymphoma and had a 
CT Torso which showed no evidence of PTLD. She received 1 dose 
of rituximab on ___ and tolerated well.

On reduction of the pt.'s prednisone, she developed severe 
myalgias and respiratory distress thought to be ___ muscle 
weakness, hypervolemia, and flash pulmonary edema with BPs in 
220s/110s. She was transferred to the ICU, required intubation, 
and was diuresed.  She was extubated and her respiratory status 
returned to baseline. She was found to have both a new 
consolidation on CXR evaluated by both the pulmonary service and 
infectious disease service who both recommended a course of 
antibiosis for HCAP. She also had an elevated troponin during 
this episode. Cardiology evaluated pt and determined her to have 
an NSTEMI in the setting of elevated troponin and new focal wall 
motion abnormality on echocardiogram. She continued to have 
myalgias and had a muscle biopsy and EMG to better assess the 
cause of her myalgias. ___ results indicate no signs of 
active GVHD or GVHD myasthenia ___. Final results are 
pending. She remained hemodynamically stable and was discharged 
to rehab on her admission dose of prednisone.
 
ACTIVE ISSUES

# Acute Myalgias and Muscle Weakness:  On admission, pt. reports 
diffuse muscle weakness and myalgias.  Following reduction of 
prednisone from alternating 15mg/20mg daily, pt. had significant 
worsening of symptoms.  CK was mildly elevated.  For concern of 
worsening symptoms ___ to ongoing levofloxacin (has been 
associated with increased risk of tenosynovitis in pt.'s on 
chronic steroids), this medication was discontinued.  An EMG was 
done showing no evidence of GVHD induced myasthenia ___.  
___ muscle biopsy performed on ___ of the left biceps 
femoris biopsy returned negative for any evidence of 
inflammation.  The most likely etiology of the patient's 
symptoms were thought to be ___ profound deconditioning with a 
possible component of steroid induced myopathic fibroatrophy 
given ongoing steroids over the last ___ years.  GVHD less likely 
given no evidence of myositis on ___ path, although pt.'s 
physical exam is somewhat consistent with chronic GVHD. 

# Respiratory Failure:  Following reduction of patient's 
steroids, pt. developed profound muscle weakness.  In this 
setting, she became hypoxic and later hypertensive with BPs in 
220s/110s.  She had a presumed episode of flash pulmonary edema 
which resulted in her transfer to the ICU and subsequent 
intubation.  Pt. was diuresed significantly and extubated 
without issue.  She was thought to be volume overloaded 
secondary to initial resuscitation following her pre-syncopal 
presentation.  Pt. continued to respond well to diuresis and was 
transferred back to the medical floor.

# Hospital Acquired Pneumonia:  Pt. had a new consolidation on 
CXR on this admission.  Started on HCAP coverage with 
vanc/meropenem.  The patient initially responded well and was 
d/c'ed off vanc.  Given concern for worsening pneumonia and 
respiratory distress, pulmonary was consulted for possible 
bronchoscopy.  ___ then recommended cardiology evaluation given 
ongoing elevated troponin and question of ischemic changes seen 
on TTE and EKG.  ID also saw pt. and recommended continuation of 
levofloxacin for total of 5 day course for atypical coverage and 
meropenem for total of 8 day course.  For concern that 
levofloxacin was contributing to pt.'s myalgias/ tendonitis, pt. 
was discontinued 1 day earlier than completion of full course.  
At time of discharge, pt. had ongoing improving cough.  She had 
a repeat CXR (___) negative for consolidation or pulmonary 
edema.  

# NSTEMI:  In the setting of episode of flash pulmonary edema, 
pt. had an elevated troponin.  Cardiology evaluated the patient 
who recommended a repeat TTE which revealed showed decrease in 
EF to 40% and akinesis of the anteroseptal wall.  Given her 
known CAD, this was thought to most likely be related to either 
a type 1 primary coronary event or type 2 demand ischemia in the 
setting of recent hypertensive emergency and flash pulmonary 
edema.  Given that pt. was a poor cath candidate with ongoing 
acute on chronic kidney injury, will proceed with medical 
optimization at this time.  As such, pt. was discharged on ASA 
81mg Daily, metoprolol and amlodipine for afterload reduction.  
A statin was held at this time given ongoing myalgias.  Her 
losartan was held for resolving acute on chronic kidney injury.  


# Admission Troponin elevation:  Pt. had admission Troponin peak 
at 1.07, CK-MB 11. Patient did not have chest pain at this time, 
but did report dizziness and dyspnea which may be her anginal 
equivalent. ECG on admission was not suggestive of ischemia.  
Pt. evaluated for ACS but noted to have downtrending trops in 
setting of resolving anemia and resolving acute on chronic 
kidney injury.  Initial TTE showed hyperdynamic function 
consistent with her volume depleted status.  In the setting of 
known CAD, pt. also had a persantine stress MIBI which was 
negative for evidence of malperfusion/ischemia.  Likely cause of 
admission troponin elevation was thought to be due to demand 
ischemia in the setting of anemia in addition to poor clearance 
in the setting of acute on chronic kidney injury.  

# Poor appetite:  Patient not taking good PO at home. Signs of 
anasarca on exam with diffuse dependent edema.  Pt. states that 
she is eating more on this hospitalization compared to any other 
time recently.  Denies nausea/vomiting, abdominal symptoms, 
diarrhea.  Pt. was started on marinol for appetite stimulation 
but developed excess sedation.  This medication was 
discontinued. 

# Anemia:  On admission, pt. found to have Hct drop from 27 to 
19.  She received fluids in clinic of unknown quantity.  No 
history of bleeding.  Anemia work-up was negative for hemolysis 
with normal TSH level.  Pt. did have a retic count which was low 
given the level of anemia consistent with decreased production 
likely ___ pt's CML.  Her Hct remained stable after initial 
transfusion throughout the remainder of admission.

# Presyncope/lightheadedness:  Pt. presented with orthostatic 
hypotension in the setting of poor PO intake and ongoing 
antihypertensive/diuretic therapy making hypovolemia the most 
likely etiology. Given troponin elevation, considered cardiac 
etiology however stress MIBI negative.  Her lightheadedness 
resolved after giving IV fluids.  Her home furosemide and 
amlodipine were discontinued.  The patient was discharged on a 
reduced hypertensive regimen as described in transitional 
issues. 

# Acute on chronic kidney injury:  On admission, pt. was found 
to have creatinine elevated to 2.6 from baseline of 1.5 to 2.0.  
Likely pre-renal given hypovolemia with orthostasis.  She 
received IV fluids and her creatinine returned to baseline.  Pt. 
then had second episode of acute on chronic kidney injury ___ 
poor forward flow in the setting of flash pulmonary edema and 
NSTEMI.  Her renal function returned to baseline with diuresis.  
She was noted to have an elevated uric acid at this time which 
dramatically decreased following one dose of rasburicase. 

# CML
Accelerated phase CML s/p sibling allo D0 ___ now relapsed 
CML.  BCR-ABL returned slightly elevated compared to prior.  We 
continued prophylaxis on home acyclovir, atovaquone, fluconazole 
at renal dosing.  Her prednisone was attempted to be reduced to 
15mg daily to improve control of CML with evidence of increasing 
BCR-ABL.  The pt. did not tolerate this as above.  She has a 
repeat BCR ABL and kinase domain mutation pending.  TKI should 
be considered as an outpatient.

# Elevated EBV Viral Load
EBV was elevated on last admission and more elevated on this 
admission.  HHV6/Parvo B19 negative.  For concern of 
PTLD/lymphoma, pt. was evaluated with CT Torso which showed no 
evidence of PTLD.  Pt. given 1 dose of rituximab on ___ and 
tolerated it well.  

# Sinusitis 
Pt. received course of levofloxacin with resolution of symptoms.

CHRONIC ISSUES
# Hypertension:  Stable.  Continued altered regimen as described 
above.

# Hyperlipidemia
Stable.  Not currently on therapy at this time

# Coronary artery disease 
Stable.  Will continue home aspirin and antihypertensives as 
above.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:

1. Heme/Onc Follow-Up: Pt. requires follow-up with Dr. ___ on 
___ and ___. 

2. NSTEMI Follow-Up: Pt. requires follow-up with cardiology in 
___ weeks from discharge. She also should have a repeat TTE 
shortly prior to this visit. She has an appt. with cardiology on 
___.

3. Lab Work: Pt. does have chronic anemia and thrombocytopenia 
secondary to her CML. Pt. should receive labs every other day 
(CBC with diff, Chem 10, ALT, AST, Alk Phos, TBili, LDH, ___, 
PTT, INR) while at rehab. Lab results should be faxed to Dr. 
___ office at ___.

4. Hypertension Regimen: Pt. presented with orthostasis thought 
to be ___ both poor PO intake and strict blood pressure control. 
She also had an NSTEMI while hospitalized. Pt. was discontinued 
off of her daily losartan for ongoing renal dysfunction. 
Metoprolol XL was reduced to 250mg Daily from 300mg Daily. She 
was continued on amlodipine 5mg PO Daily. Furosemide was 
continued at 20mg PO Daily. Pt's standing weight at discharge 
was 139 lbs. Pt's medications should be titrated appropriately 
to HR and BP. Her losartan should also be restarted if possible 
if close monitoring is available, in place of amlodipine if 
amlodipine if not needed for blood pressure control.

5. Immunosuppression and steroid taper: Pt. was unable to 
tolerate prednisone taper as she had significant exacerbation of 
myopathy and muscle weakness. As such, she was continued on her 
admission dose of alternating daily doses of prednisone 
15mg/20mg. If attempting to reduce prednisone in future, please 
reduce on slow taper, consider ___ / week as tolerated and 
closely monitor symptoms. 

6. Poor Nutrition: Pt. has mild anasarca likely in part due to 
poor nutrition partially caused by decreased appetite and 
nausea. Pt. was started on dronabinol to improve these symptoms, 
however she became sedated. This medication was not continued at 
discharge. She was continued on furosemide prn for management of 
fluid volume.

7. Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor: Given increase CML disease 
activity, possible use of TKI should be discussed with Dr. 
___. Ponatinib has been associated with increased incidence 
of cardiac events and should be avoided in this pt. with known 
CAD and now recent NSTEMI. Desatinib may be a better option but 
was not initiated at time of discharge. Consider slow 
uptitration of dosage starting at 20mg as pt. tolerates.

8. Levofloxacin: Pt. was discontinued off of levofloxacin as 
this medication was associated with worsening myalgias in this 
pt. Please avoid fluoroquinolone class if possible as this seems 
to worsen her myalgias. There also is a high risk of 
tenosynovitis with these abx. in pt.'s on chronic steroids. 

9. Statin: Given pt's known CAD and NSTEMI on this admission, 
pt. would benefit from a statin. Pt. was not initiated on this 
hospitalization given myalgias.

10. Steroids and Osteopenia: Pt. had a bone scan in ___ 
revealing osteopenia. Given her chronic steroid use, please 
consider every ___ month bone scans.

11. Access Issues: Vascular access and lab draws have been a 
challenge as an inpatient. Additionally, pt. has coagulopathy 
likely ___ chronic steroid use resulting in diffuse ecchymosis 
from minimal skin injury. Given upcoming treatments and likely 
multiple hospitalizations, pt. may benefit from Port vs. PICC 
placement.

12. Pulm Follow-Up: Pt. was evaluated by the pulmonary consult 
team who recommended repeat chest CT 4 weeks from ___ to 
evaluate for resolution of pneumonia. If pt. has new symptoms, 
chest CT should be considered prior to this time. If resolution, 
no pulmonary follow-up is necessary. This can be coordinated 
with Dr. ___. 

13. Pending Labs: Pt. has BCR ABL and Domain Kinase mutation lab 
pending. This should be follow-up by Dr. ___.

14. Uric Acid: Pt. had elevated uric acid level on admission. We 
did not start allopurinol at this time given resolving kidney 
dysfunction. Consider starting allopurinol as an outpatient.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___.  You were admitted to the hospital 
because you felt as though you were going to faint and were not 
eating or drinking well.  You received fluids through your IV 
and your lightheadedness improved.  You also had worsening 
kidney function likely due initially to poor oral intake and 
later to heart dysfunction.  Your heart enzymes were found to be 
elevated both on admission and during your hospitalization.  The 
ultrasound of your heart initially was normal as well as a 
stress test.  A repeat ultrasound did show some wall damage 
indicating that you most likely had a small heart attack.  
Additionally, your EBV virus level was high.  You received one 
dose of rituximab to treat the EBV virus.

You prednisone dose was decreased to help improve control of 
your CML.  However, you developed worsening muscle pain and 
required help breathing with an airway tube in the Intensive 
Care Unit.  We removed excess fluid which improved your 
breathing.  You were also found to have a pneumonia at this time 
which was treated with antibiotics.  We obtained a muscle biopsy 
and an EMG to better assess your muscle pain.  These tests are 
currently pending.  Your condition improved and you were 
discharged with close follow-up.

All the best,

Your ___ Team

clinic for lab abnormalities including hyperkalemia (5.4), 
elevated uric acid (11.5) and acute renal failure (2.3) and was 
found to have a DVT in left ___.  

#DVT in Lt ___: Based on ___ done on ___, DVT seems to be 
chronic and decreasing in size. Based on repeat ___ on ___, 
there is evidence of a new DVT in Lt superficial femoral vein 
that was not visualized on previous study. On presentation, pt 
had scute worsening of ___ edema, prompting us to do further 
imaging. Pt was initially started on heparin gtt with goal PTT 
50-80. However, given high risk of bleeding and current severe 
bruising, we transitioned to heparin SC 12500U BID. We will 
discharge pt on heparin SC 12500U BID for ___ months in 
discretion of outpatient oncologist, Dr. ___. 
- continue heparin SC 12500U BID for ___ months
- hold aspirin 81mg 

#chronic kidney failure: Cr 2.2 on discharge; baseline 1.5-2.0. 
Creatinine ranged 1.8-2.3 during hospitalization. Most likely 
prerenal in the setting of poor po intake; however, elevated 
uric acid may be contributing as well. 
. Throughout hospitalization, she received 1L of fluid and only 
upon admission. We encouraged oral intake and pt was compliant 
with plan. Given history of chronic kidney diseae and 
microangiopathic injury, small daily changes in the Cr are not 
clinically significant. ___ on presentation most likely prerenal 
given improvement with hydration. Based on renal biopsy done in 
___, there is thrombotic microangiopathic injury and severe 
intersitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. These changes may be 
due to TKI. We held lasix and discontinued it on discharge. 
Resuming lasix will be in discretion of PCP ___ Dr. ___. 
Please encourage oral intake. Please renally dose all 
medications and monitor pt's I/O's and weight. If Cr. rises, pt 
can be given IVF conservatively since new TTE showed EF 55%.  

#CML: Progression of pt's CML was not addressed during this 
hospitalization. This will be assessed as outpatient with Dr. 
___. Last BCR/AML checked on ___ and increasing. Pt p/w 
hyperuricemia and thrombocytopenia, which may be indicating 
changes in leukemia and rapid cell turn over. We tapered 
prednisone by 1mg every other day and stopped at 10mg daily. 
This is the dose we recommend on discharge. Changes can be made 
in discretion of Dr. ___. 

#Hyperuricemia: Urice acid on presentation 11.4. Pt was treated 
with one dose of rasburicase 6mg IV and was further placed on 
allopurinol ___ daily. However, repeat urice acid on ___ was 
8.7. Given that pt has CKD and is already on optimal dose of 
allopurinol ___ daily. We added Febuxostat 40 mg PO daily on 
___ and recommend continuing allopurinol for one week after 
discharge, last dose on ___. 
The exact cause of elevated uric acid is unknown. It may be due 
to rapid cell turnover and changes in CML. Pt will be follow up 
with Dr. ___ further assessment. We recommend checking 
uric acid level in one week. Elevated uric acid may be 
contributing to poor kidney function. 

#Thrombocytopenia: Plt count fluctuated through hospital course. 
This (in addition to hyperuricemia) may present rapid cell 
turnover and changes in leukemia. We discontinued aspirin on 
discharge and held it throughout hospitalization. We recommend 
monitoring plt count as outpatient. 

#Myopathy: Muscle biopsy official report showed no evidence of 
myositit but abnormal muscle fibers. Exact etiology is unclear 
but GVHD and possibly steroids likely. We tapered steroids and 
discharged pt on prednisone 10mg daily.  

#Cough: Most likely viral and post-infectious. Improving but 
intermittent in nature. It has been going on for a few weeks and 
since last admission. CT chest/sinuses negative for any acute 
infectious processes. CT-chest (done twice on ___ and ___ 
showed improvement of opacities observed in ___. Pulmonary 
was consulted and concluded no indication for bronchoscopy given 
improvement in imaging. They concluded post-infectious cough as 
most likely etiology and recommended atroven neb. Given the 
setting of new DVT, there was concern for PE. Pt was tachycardic 
but no dyspnea or pleuritic chest pain. V/Q was negative for PE 
on ___. B-glucan was positive on ___ but repeat on ___ was 
negative. Galactomannan was negative. 

#CAD s/p CABG: History of NSTEMI on last admission is 
questionable since pt only had a trop leak but no EKG changes or 
chest pain. TTE done on ___ showed improved EF 55% (compared to 
40% on last admission). Trops are elevated but seem to be 
chronic and due to CKD. EKG with no acute ischemic changes. We 
held ASA during hospitalization and discontinued on discharge 
since pt is on heparin, she presented with severe bruising, and 
she continued have thrombocytopenia. 

#Hypertension: We continued metoprolol 250mg and amlodipine 5mg.

Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you here at the ___ 
___. 

You presented to us with laboratory abnormalities most likely 
due to acute kidney injury and dehydration. We treated you with 
IV fluids and following adequate hydration, these laboratory 
abnormalities resolved and your kidney function improved. In 
addition, your uric acid was very high on admission and you were 
given medications to lower the level since it can cause damage 
to your kidneys. You are being discharged on new medications, 
called allopurinol and febuxostat to maintain low uric acid 
levels. Allopurinol will be discontinued in one week, ___. It 
is important to mention that given your history of chronic 
kidney disease, small daily changes in your kidney function are 
not of clinical significance and can be managed by IV fluids. We 
encourage you to drink plenty of water everyday.

need aggressive steroids. Dyspnea seems to be slightly worse per 
the patient, but not acutely so. She initially received IV 
steroids and Zithromax. Also underwent CTA chest to rule out PE.

In addition she notes long standing moderate frank hematochezia 
due to known hemorrhoids. She reports her stools are often 
grape-jelly like.

___ F w/ hx of COPD presenting for dyspnea. Pt went to 
pulmonary clinic today and found to have PFTs suggesting severe 
obstruction with FEV1 0.63L, 21% predicted, FVC 43% predicted.

IMAGING/STUDIES
===============
CTA CHEST ___
Limited by respiratory motion.  No evidence of pulmonary 
embolism to the 
segmental level or aortic abnormality. 

TTE ___
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal 
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be 
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is 
low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The right ventricular free wall is 
hypertrophied. with borderline normal free wall function. There 
is abnormal septal motion/position (there is an intermittent 
septal bounce that is nonspecific. Can be seen in constrictive 
pericarditis, but there is no other clear evidence for this 
including reduced e' velocities). The number of aortic valve 
leaflets cannot be determined. There is no aortic valve 
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is borderline pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which 
most likely represents a prominent fat pad. 
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Low normal global 
biventricular systolic function. Couldnt assess RV size well 
but may be mildly dilated. Borderline pulmonary hypertension. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___ 
global biventricular systolic function is less vigorous. 
Pulmonary pressures are lower but could be underestimated due to 
limited interrogation angles with poor image quality (patient 
could not roll over for the technologist).  

CT ABD/PELV ___
FINDINGS:    
LOWER CHEST: Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. 
There is no 
evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.

throughout.  
There is no evidence of focal lesions.  There is no evidence of 
intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.  The 
gallbladder is within normal limits.   
PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, 
without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal 
dilatation.  There is no peripancreatic stranding.   
SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, 
without 
evidence of focal lesions.   
ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size 
and shape.   
URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with 
normal nephrogram.  There is no evidence of focal renal lesions 
or hydronephrosis.  There is no perinephric abnormality.   
GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable.  Small bowel 
loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and 
enhancement throughout.  The colon and rectum are within normal 
limits.   
PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. 
 There is no free fluid in the pelvis.   
REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The visualized reproductive organs are 
unremarkable.  
LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric 
lymphadenopathy.  There 
is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.   
VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Mild 
atherosclerotic disease 
is noted.   
BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or 
acute fracture.  
Fixation hardware noted from L4-S1.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with hx of Gold Stage IV COPD, hemorrhoidal bleeding, GERD, 
and HFrEF (EF 40%) who presents from pulmonary clinic in setting 
of severe COPD, FEV1/FVC 32% (FEV1 21% predicted), new anemia of 
unclear etiology. She was treated with steroids and discharged 
on a steroid taper. There was concern initially for COPD 
exacerbation but further history revealed she was near her 
baseline respiratory function. Her respiratory function was 
concerning for her home safety and after ___ evaluation, the 
decision was made to discharge her to rehabilitation ___. 
During her hospitalization, she was found to have anemia 
(baseline Hgb from ___ of 12, down to 9 on admission and 
stable at 8). Given significant change from baseline, concern 
for active blood loss anemia. Stool guaiac x 3 negative, CT A/P 
without evidence of acute bleed/retroperitoneal bleed. Likely, 
anemia secondary to hemorrhoid bleeding per history but Hgb 
remained stable throughout remainder of hospitalization and was 
stable at 8.7 on discharge. 

# Acute on chronic anemia - Hemoglobin of 7.9 ___ (stably low 
on subsequent repeats ___ was concerning given 
history of severe hemorrhoids and also upper GI symptoms 
(epigastric pain and nausea)/history of acute pancreatitis 
(lipase normal).  This may all have been ___ hemorrhoidal 
bleeding, though initial rectal guaiac NEG.  Upper GI source 
considered (may be hidden somewhat ___ severe constipation), 
especially in setting of complaints of epigastric pain and 
ongoing steroid treatment for COPD.  No signs of RP bleed on 
physical exam, abdominal exam benign.  CT Abd/pelv ___ with NO 
sign of intraabdominal bleed.  Hemolysis labs unremarkable.  
Iron studies consistent with Fe deficiency (Fe 45, Ferritin 9.1, 
Fe sat ~8%), started PO supplemental iron.  Reticulocyte index 
<2% suggesting marrow suppression, furthermore WBC count quite 
low despite treatment with high dose steroids.  Patient with 
history of multiple SBOs, ?malabsorption, B12 equivocal at 334, 
together with Fe deficiency may have caused a normocytic 
anemia/cytopenias.  Started B12 supplementation at time of 
discharge.  After giving aggressive bowel regimen ___, patient 
had several BMs, the last of which this AM was mixed with red 
blood, most likely bleeding internal hemorrhoids.  Given that Hb 
was stable (8.4->8.7), patient cleared for discharge with close 
outpatient follow-up with her PCP to monitor CBC.        
- Pantoprazole 40mg BID
- Supplemental Iron
- Supplemental B12
- Continue bowel regimen as outpatient to prevent constipation 
leading to increased straining/worsening hemorrhoids 

# COPD - Gold Stage IV - Patient seen by ___ pulmonologist Dr. 
___, with whom primary team was in close contact.  Patient 
tried all standard treatments in past, much difficulties with 
different nebulizers ('jitteriness' and 'laryngitis').  Not 
using home O2, though it was prescribed.  Patient stated that 
she feels comfortable while still/in bed, dyspnea only with 
exertion.  O2 sats remained in high ___, no signs of acute CO2 
retention (pCO2 45 on VBG ___. Patient received duonebs 
q6h, intermittently refused due to 'laryngitis.'  Patient 
initially received IV methylpred and azithromycin on admission.  
Transitioned patient promptly to PO steroids, short taper esp in 
setting of ongoing anemia/upper GI complaints (will complete 
___.  d/c'd azithromycin ___.  Given Dr. ___, 
reached out to palliative care for support, they saw patient 
___ (discussed the possibility of starting methadone in future 
to help with respiratory symptoms, did not start the day of 
discharge).  SW also saw patient.  Patient seen by ___ ___, 
suggested outpatient rehab.  Social situation at home very 
difficult, patient lives home alone with little support.  Of 
note, PE initially considered as another explanation for ongoing 
SOB, though patient had good sats, no pleuritic chest pain, CTA 
chest NEG ___.

# Chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction - EF40% 
reportedly from ___ (___ ___.  Likely ___ 
cor pulmonale, unlikely acute exacerbation as BNP 75.  TTE ___, 
poor image quality, normal LV size and fxn, EF 50-55%, RV 
hypertrophy, improved pulm art HTN, less vigorous global 
biventricular fxn.

IMAGING:
___ CT CHEST W/O CON
IMPRESSION: 
1.  New small foci of ground-glass opacities in the upper lobes, 
larger on the 
left, are worrisome for infection. 
2.  Stable splenomegaly. 
3.  Dense coronary calcifications. 
4.  New small left effusion. 
5.  Stable enlargement of the main pulmonary arteries suggesting 
pulmonary 
hypertension. 

___ LLE DUPLEX U/S
IMPRESSION: 
  
Chronic, non-occlusive thrombus of the left proximal superficial 
femoral vein, 
unchanged since ___.   

___ CXR (PORT)
REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with CML 
transformation into AML and blast crisis with persistent cough. 
Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison 
to ___. 
The right central venous line tip is at the cavoatrial 
junction/proximal right atrium.  Heart size and mediastinum are 
stable.  There is new left 
retrocardiac opacity, not seen on the prior study, concerning 
for left lower lobe pneumonia associated with small amount of 
pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen. 

___ TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild 
to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with 
near-akinesis of the septum, and hypokinesis of the basal-mid 
anterior wall. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left 
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is 
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The 
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is 
no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most 
likely represents a prominent fat pad. 

IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction 
consistent with LAD ischemia/infarction. Mild mitral 
regurgitation. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___ and 
___, the function of the septum and anterior wall are 
similar (septal function was described as mildly hypokinetic on 
the most recent study but it was severely hypokinetic then 
also). The function of the mid to distal inferior wall has 
improved. Mild mitral regurgitation is seen.  

PATHOLOGY:
___ IMMUNOPHENOTYPING
Increased number of blasts. In a context of patient's known CML, 
this is concerning for acute blast crisis.  Correlation with 
clinical findings and morphology (see separate report 
___ is recommended.  Flow cytometry immunophenotyping 
may not detect all abnormal populations due to topography, 
sampling or artifacts of sample preparation

___ Bone marrow bx
 Chronic Myelogeneous leukemia - Blast phase (CML-BP), see note.
Note: This represents acute myelegenous transformation of the 
patient's
previously diagnosed CML; ie., CML-BP. CD34 and CD117 are 
increased and
highlight blasts occupying estimated 70-80% of the overall 
cellularity.
 CD20 highlights rare B cells.  CD3 stains interstitial T 
lymphocytes.
CD42 is present in the megakaryocytes, which do not appear 
increased.
TdT is negative.  MP0 is not expressed in blasts.  Glycophorin
highlights erythroid precursors, but is negative in the blasts.

___ Skin bx
PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:

Skin, left mid back; punch biopsy:

 - Mild spongiosis with dyskeratosis, patchy interface 
inflammation and
focal intra-epidermal eosinophils,  with superficial 
perivascular
mononuclear cell infiltrate and dermal eosinophils (see 
comment).
 - No fungal organisms identified on a PAS stain.
 - Multiple tissue levels examined.

Comment:  The histologic differential diagnosis includes both a
hypersensitivity reaction and graft versus host disease. The 
presence
of eosinophils is compatible with the clinical suspicion of a 
drug
eruption, although they do not exclude graft versus host 
disease.
Clinical correlation is recommended.

 

 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with CML s/p sibling allo D0 ___, complicated by chronic 
GVHD with gut, liver, muscle involvement presenting from ___ 
clinic with hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, hypercalcemia, ___ on 
CKD and pancytopenia, now with conversion to AML.
 
#CML/AML: BCR/ABL trended up from 0 to 2 to 5 to 104 to 162. 
Presented with hyperuricemia and pancytopenia likely due to 
conversion to AML and rapid cell turn over. No evidence of 
bleeding. Hemolysis unlikely with normal coag studies and Tbili. 
 Retic count 1.8 with retic index 0.88% showed poor red cell 
production. CMV/EBV/HHV6 negative. BM bx shows conversion to AML 
with as much as 65% blasts on smear with absolute blast count as 
high as 1200 and 0% neutrophils. Treated with 12 days of 
nilotinib with no improvement. Given continued decline and poor 
prognosis, transitioned to comfort measures only after which she 
expired. 

#Cough/HCAP: Patient had intermittently productive cough for ___ 
weeks with negative workup on last admission including CXR, CT 
Chest, V/Q scan, rapid resp viral panel. Clear lung exam, 
negative CXR at rehab prior to admission. RRV panel and cx, 
beta-glucan, galactomannan negative. BNP >40K so volume overload 
potentially played a partial role especially given LVEF 40-45% 
on TTE. PE unlikely as patient not hypoxic, no evidence of right 
heart strain on EKG, no evidence of infarct on CT Chest; 
regardless, anticoagulation held in setting of thrombocytopenia 
and no hemodynamic compromise. CT showed ?infectious process, in 
the setting of worsening cough/resp status portable CXR showed 
likely LLL PNA. On ___ patient met ___ SIRS criteria 
(tachycardic, tachypneic, low WBC) so cx drawn and started on 
empiric vanc/meropenem. Received benzonatate, codeine, 
guaifenesin-dextromethorphan as well as levalbuterol/ipratropium 
nebs prn for symptomatic relief. With continued worsening 
respiratory status patient started on morphine for SOB O2 
supplementation prn. Given prognosis, she was transitioned to 
comfort measures only with withdrawal of abx, scopalamine patch, 
and morphine gtt, on which she expired. 

#Hypercalcemia: Baseline high 8s-9s, on admission 10.7. Unclear 
etiology, given elevated alk phos in the setting of CKD could 
have increased bony release of calcium though increased bone 
turnover would likely cause a higher phosphate level. PTH 6 
which rules out hyperparathyroidism and makes hypercalcemia in 
the setting of worsening CML more likely especially with Vit D 
wnl but PTHrP elevated. Received IVF, furosemide, ___ dose 
pamidronate ___ and calcitonin ___ while calcium 
carbonate/Vit D held and calcium downtrended to 8.4.

#UTI: Found to have citrobacter/klebsiella UTI on culture taken 
after patient began to appear septic with ___ SIRS signs. 
Infection was covered by meropenem rx'ed for putative PNA. Foley 
catheter was left in place for comfort and abx discontinued when 
patient transitioned to comfort measures only. 

#CHF: Patient has known CHF likely of ischemic nature given CAD, 
found to have persistent LVEF 40-45% on TTE ___. Increased 
volume with IVF for hypercalcemia tx led to increasing dyspnea 
treated with oxygen supplementation, which improved after 
diuresis and PNA tx as above. At this point, IVF held as calcium 
dropped and for comfort reasons. 
 
#DVT in LLE: Left superficial femoral vein DVT found on last 
admission, discharged on SQ heparin for tx. Previously presented 
with acute worsening of LLE edema but now reduced compared to 
prior admission. LLE U/S shows unchanged partially occlusive 
clot of proximal superficial femoral vein. Anticoagulation held 
given thrombocytopenia, IVC filter placement held given 
stability of clot and goals of care. 

#Hyperuricemia: Uric acid on presentation 9.5. Pt treated on 
last admission with rasburicase and started on allopurinol and 
febuxostat. Discharged with uric acid 8.7. Febuxostat held on 
this admission due to drug rash. Elevated uric acid possibly due 
to worsening renal function in the setting of hypovolemia but 
given rising BCR-ABL and known CML->AML progression likely due 
to rapid cell turnover. Elevated uric acid unlikely to be 
contributing to poor kidney function given no urate crystals on 
urine sediment. Treated with rasburicase x1, uric acid dropped 
to but rose to 9.6 over several days. Allopurinol discontinued 
after patient transitioned to comfort measures only. 

#CKD: Baseline Cr 1.5-2.0 due to thrombotic microangiopathic 
injury with severe interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy 
possibly related to TKI shown on renal biopsy ___. Cr 2.2 on 
last discharge, presented with Cr 2.9. Most likely prerenal in 
the setting of poor po intake and hypovolemia; elevated uric 
acid unlikely to be causing renal damage after improvement with 
fluids and no urate crystals. Cr worsened to 2.5 after several 
doses of IV lasix. Urine output decreased ___. Further 
diuresis held, no further IVF or intervention to improve kidney 
function after transition to comfort care only. 

#GVHD: Known skin, gut, liver, muscle involvement. Aldolase 
mildly elevated consistent with known muscle disease but 
improved from ___. Rash likely drug related over acute GVHD 
per derm bx. Continued on prednisone 10mg then transitioned to 
4mg IV solumedrol BID given inability to tolerate PO prior to 
discontinuation of steroids given goals of care. 

#CAD s/p CABG: History of ?NSTEMI in past, ___ TTE with 
preserved EF 55%. ASA held due to thrombocytopenia. 

#Nutrition: Patient's weight has fallen from 141 to 127 lbs 
since ___, likely ___ poor PO intake. Copper level wnl, 
B6 low. Supplemented with ensure while taking PO prior to 
transition to comfort care.  

#Hypertension: 
-Stable on metoprolol and amlodipine until transition to comfort 
care at which point both rx dc'ed. 

Patient sadly died overnight ___ with her family 
present after comfort care for about 3 days.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Band Prolapse
 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.
 
Discharge Instructions:
Your band was removed, but that does not mean you have to 
abandon your efforts to improve your health.  Take this 
opportunity and incorporate what you have learned from your 
health care team.  Continue being active on a regular basis and 
follow these healthful guidelines (not diet!) for life long 
benefits.

In the hospital, you will be on a stage 3 diet for healing.  
This diet includes all liquid, high protein, low sugar and low 
fat supplements.  When you are discharged home, you may advance 
your diet as tolerated.  Below are some helpful tips to continue 


your journey of eating well and healthy living.

 

1.Keep an eye on calories.

2.Always eat at a table.  Avoid eating while driving, standing, 


sitting on the sofa, or lying in bed.  

3.Eat slowly.  Continue to take 30 minutes to eat a meal and 
chew your foods thoroughly. 

4.Surround yourself with healthy foods. Clean out your cabinets 


of any trigger or unsafe foods.

5.Keep a food journal or track your intake on-line.  Record 
what you eat, portion sizes, and the time you eat.  You may want 


to include your mood and hunger level, as well.

6.Avoid skipping meals.  Always eat at regular times to avoid 
overeating later in the day.

7.Listen to your body.  Eat when you are physically hungry and 
stop when you are full.

8.Be active.  Engage in at least ___ minutes of physical 
activity most (if not all) days of the week. 

9.Regularly check your weight.  Give yourself an acceptable 
range (i.e. 5 pounds).  This prevents slip ups from becoming 
bigger problems down the road.

10. Make small changes.  Set small, reasonable goals to keep on 


track. 

11. Reward yourself.  Treat yourself when you reach goals with 
a non-food treat (i.e. pedicure, movie). 

12. Ask for support. Call the ___ nutrition clinic for 
follow-up at ___. Join Weight Watchers, talk to friends 


and family or contact a local dietitian. 

13. Drink plenty of fluids. Stay hydrated.

Fluids & Diet
Fluid intake is extremely important the first month of your 
recovery. You must also take in enough liquids
to prevent dehydration. Dehydration can cause nausea, fatigue, 
lightheadedness and dark urine.  We recommend you track what you 


drink and eat each day. 
Most Frequent Problems

Discomfort
Abdominal soreness below your ribs on the left side is the most 
common site of tenderness after waking up. Despite this 
discomfort, it is very important that you get out of bed and 
take short walks.

Dehydration
Your most important job after surgery is drinking enough fluid. 
Dehydration is the most common reason to return to the hospital 
after surgery. Your goal is to drink 8 cups (64 oz) of fluid a 
day. You may not be able to drink this much fluid at first, but 
come as close as you can. Refer to your nutrition
packet for more details.

Wound Drainage & Infection
It is important to care for your incisions to prevent infection. 


You will have small fiber tapes on your wounds. This should keep 


your wound dry and closed. Leave them on until they fall off by 
themselves. Do not put band aids, ointments, lotions or powder 
on your incisions. You may get your incisions wet but
avoid scrubbing them. Pat them dry. It is not unusual for an 
incision to drain a little bloody fluid after you
go home. If you have some drainage, dab the wounds with diluted 
hydrogen peroxide (hydrogen
peroxide mixed half and half with water) and then cover with a 
dry gauze. Doing this twice a day will
speed your recovery.
Infections are uncommon and rarely serious after a laparoscopic 
operation. An infection will be red, warm,
firm, and tender. The infected fluid will look more like pus 
than like blood. If you notice this please call the
nurse at the Bariatric ___ Program to discuss your symptoms

Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Except for subsegmental 
atelectasis in the lingula, lungs are clear.  No pleural 
effusion or pneumothorax is present. Clips are seen in the right 
upper quadrant of the abdomen.  No acute osseous abnormalities 
are identified.
 
IMPRESSION:
No acute cardiopulmonary process.

STRESS ECHO ___
The patient exercised for 9 minutes and 0 seconds according to a 
Gervino treadmill protocol ___ METS) reaching a peak heart rate 
of 102 bpm and a peak blood pressure of 170/80 mmHg. The test 
was stopped because of fatigue. This level of exercise 
represents a poor exercise tolerance for age. The exercise ECG 
was uninterpretable due to resting ST-T wave changes (see 
exercise report for details). There is resting systolic 
hypertension. The blood pressure response to stress was blunted. 
There was a blunted heart rate response to stress [beta 
blockade].

Resting images were acquired at a heart rate of 56 bpm and a 
blood pressure of 162/90 mmHg. These demonstrated normal 
regional and global left ventricular systolic function. Right 
ventricular free wall motion is normal. There is no pericardial 
effusion. Doppler demonstrated mild mitral regurgitation with no 
aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation or significant resting 
LVOT gradient. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. Echo images were acquired within 43 seconds after 
peak stress at heart rates of 92 - 80 bpm. These demonstrated 
appropriate augmentation of all left ventricular segments. There 
was augmentation of right ventricular free wall motion.

IMPRESSION: Poor functional exercise capacity. Uninterpretable 
ECG changes in the absence of 2D echocardiographic evidence of 
inducible ischemia to achieved low workload. Mild mitral 
regurgitation at rest. 

___ STRESS
This ___ y.o. IDDM woman with h/o HTN was referred to 
the lab for evaluation of chest pain and dyspnea. The patient 
exercised 
for 9.0 minutes of a Gervino protocol (~ ___ METS), representing 
a poor 
exercise tolerance for her age. The test was stopped due to 
fatigue. 
At minute 7 of exercise, the patient noted ___ non-progressive 
left 
sided chest heaviness. This discomfort improved with deep 
inspiration 
and resolving quickly in recovery by minute 1.25. At peak 
exercise, 
there was non-specific T wave normalization was noted. The T 
waves 
returned to baseline in recovery. The rhythm was sinus with 
rare, 
isolated apbs, frequent, polymorphic vpbs, and several 
ventricular 
couplets throughout the study. Baseline systolic hypertension 
with an 
initial drop in systolic blood pressure during exercise. 
Appropriate increase in blood pressure response to exercise as 
it 
continued but the overall response was blunted. Blunted heart 
rate 
response to exercise in the presence of beta blocker therapy. 
  
IMPRESSION: Poor exercise capacity. Atypical anginal type 
symptoms with 
uninterpretable ECG changes to achieved low workload. Resting 
systolic hypertension with abnormal blood pressure and blunted 
heart 
rate response to exercise. Echo report sent separately. 

 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with DM, HTN, ___ edema presented to ED with Chest Pain. 
Chest pain was exertional in nature and raised concern for 
unstable angina. Initial troponins x2 in ED were negative. EKG 
with no acute ischemic changes. Chest pain may have been 
muscular in origin or associated with anxiety at the time, given 
patient's known history of panic attacks. Given patient's risk 
factors she underwent a stress test on ___ which showed 
nonspecific ECG changes in the absence of 2D echo evidence of 
inducible ischemia. ___ hospital course is summarized by 
problems below:

raised concern for unstable angina. Initial troponins x 2 
negative along with no EKG changes.Third troponin also returned 
negative. Stress was done on ___ which showed nonspecific 
ECG changes in the absence of 2D echo evidence of inducible 
ischemia.LVEF greater than 60%. Reached METS of 4.8 on stress. 
Patient was medically treated on aspirin 81. Home atenolol was 
discontinued and patient was started on losartan 25 daily during 
this hospitalization. PCP was notified prior to discharge and 
will monitor blood pressure on discharge. 

#HTN:SBP in th 130's. HTN was controlled with home dose of lasix 
and losaratan 25 daily. Atenolol was discontinued.

# DM: Hg A1C was 8.6 on ___. Patient's oral hypoglycemics 
were held during hospitalization. Blood sugars were controlled 
with ISS.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male without medical care 
for several years, no known past medical history, who initially 
presented to ___ on ___ with SOB and palpitations. 

In the ED at ___ he was found to be in afib with RVR to 
150s and respiratory distress. He was initially on BiPAP and 
weaned to ___.  CXR showed bialteral infiltrates concerning for 
pulmonary edema. Troponin was mildly elevated to 0.16, BNP was 
1066. An EKG showed lateral STD and cardiology was consulted. He 
was initially given ASA but heparin gtt was not started due to 
concern for AAA (See below). He was initially treated with 
diltiazem gtt and admitted to the ICU. An echo was obtained due 
to pulmonary edema and orthopnea and revealed a LVEF 35%, 
mild-mod global hypokinesis of inferior wall and septum, mod AI, 
mod AS, mod MR, mod TR, and mod pulmonary HTN. There was also 
moderate dilation of the aortic root and ascending aorta. No 
significant pericardial effusion was seen.  

The patient's labs were also notable for a marked leukocytosis 
with L-shift including 2% blasts. Due to concern for infection a 
CTA chest with CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast was obtained 
to rule out infectious source and PE. There was no PE or 
evidence of infection but a 6cm infrarenal AAA with possible 
evidence of impending rupture was seen. Dr. ___ at ___ 
reviewed the images urgently and felt no evidence of imminent 
rupture but transfer was initiated. 

While in the ICU he was switched from diltiazem to esmolol gtt 
and diuresed with IV Lasix with improvement in his orthopnea. 
The CTA had also been notable for bilateral pleural effusions 
and infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema. 

On arrival to ___ the patient reports feeling improved without 
any pain or discomfort. He relays the following history: He last 
had a physical ___ years ago as part of being a ___ 
___. He has no known medical history. At baseline he has no 
functional limitation with walking on flat ground and can walk 
up at lest 2 flights of stairs without needing to stop for air. 
He has no orthopnea, PND, leg swelling, palpitations, or chest 
pain at baseline. He had no fevers, chills, URI symptoms, n/v/d 
prior to this presentation. 

He has smoked 1ppd for at least ___ years, 2 ppd for the last 
year, and quit 3 weeks ago. He previously drank 5 mixed drinks 
per week but cut back to 3 mixed drinks per week 6 months ago 
with no history of alcohol withdrawal. No recreational drugs, no 
new sexual contacts and no history of STDs.

+Coronary angiogram ___
Coronary Description
The coronary circulation is right dominant.
LM: The Left Main, arising from the left cusp, is a large 
caliber vessel. This vessel bifurcates into the
Left Anterior Descending and Left Circumflex systems.
LAD: The Left Anterior Descending artery, which arises from the 
LM, is a large caliber vessel. There is
a 50% stenosis in the proximal segment.
The Septal Perforator, arising from the proximal segment, is a 
small caliber vessel.
The Diagonal, arising from the proximal segment, is a medium 
caliber vessel.
Cx: The Circumflex artery, which arises from the LM, is a large 
caliber vessel. There is a 90% stenosis
in the mid segment of the AV groove branch of the LCx
The Obtuse Marginal, arising from the proximal segment, is a 
medium caliber vessel.
RCA: The Right Coronary Artery, arising from the right cusp, is 
a large caliber vessel. There is a 50%
stenosis in the proximal segment.
The Right Posterior Descending Artery, arising from the distal 
segment, is a medium caliber vessel.
The Right Posterolateral Artery, arising from the distal 
segment, is a medium caliber vessel.
Findings
 Three vessel coronary artery disease. Moderate LAD and RCA 
disease with most significant
diseases noted in the medium caliber AV groove segment of the 
LCx

___
CONCLUSION:
The left atrial volume index is SEVERELY increased. The right 
atrium is mildly enlarged. The estimated right atrial pressure 
is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with a borderline increased/dilated cavity. There is 
normal regional left ventricular systolic function. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed. There is 
beat-to-beat variability in the left
ventricular contractility due to the irregular rhythm. The 
visually estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is 45-50%. 
Left ventricular cardiac index is normal (>2.5 L/min/m2). (-10.4 
%; normal less
than -20%) There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract 
gradient. Mildly dilated right ventricular
cavity with normal free wall motion. The aortic sinus diameter 
is normal for gender with normal
ascending aorta diameter for gender. The aortic arch diameter is 
normal with a mildly dilated descending
aorta. The abdominal aorta is severely dilated. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are moderately thickened.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.5 
cm2). However, dimensionless index is 0.26
when using the same beat that exhibits highest peak velocity 
through the aortic valve. There is mild to
moderate [___] aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets 
are mildly thickened with no mitral valve
prolapse. Torn mitral valve chordae are seen. There is mild [1+] 
mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild [1+] tricuspid 
regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: 1) Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction suggesting 
CAD in LCX territory. Global
longitudinal strain is moderately depressed. 2) Moderate aortic 
stenosis by aortic valve area
however the dimensionless index borders to severe aortic 
stenosis repeat evaluation of aortic
stenosis severity in sinus rhythm may bring clarity about true 
severity of aortic stenosis. 3) The
patient has significant mitral annular calcification and 
thickening of the mitral valve leaflets with
reverbaration artifact in the left atrium however a small 
echogenicity on the posterior mitral
annulus cannot be excluded. If clinically indicated a TEE may 
improve visualization.

+TEE ___
CONCLUSION:
There is moderate/severe spontaneous echo contrast in the body 
of the left atrium and in the left atrial appendage. A probable 
xx cm left atrial appendage thrombus is seen. The left atial 
appendage ejection
velocity is very depressed. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen 
in the body of the right atrium or right atrial appendage. There 
is no evidence for an atrial septal defect by 2D/color Doppler. 
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch with complex (>4mm, 
non-mobile) atheroma in the descending aorta to 35cm from the 
incisors. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are moderately 
thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. No abscess is seen. There is trace aortic 
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately 
thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral 
valve. No abscess is seen. There is mild to
moderate [___] mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve 
leaflets appear structurally normal. No mass/ vegetation are 
seen on the tricuspid valve. No abscess is seen. There is mild 
[1+] tricuspid regurgitation.
IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast with 
probable formation of sludge/thrombus in the left atrial 
appendage. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. Complex 
atheroma in the descending aorta.

Brief Hospital Course:
========
SUMMARY
========
Mr. ___ is a ___ male without medical care 
for several years, no known past medical history, who initially 
presented to ___ on ___ with SOB and palpitations, 
found to have heart failure (acute, unclear if chronic 
component), afib with RVR, leukocytosis with left shift, and 
infrarenal 6cm AAA. 

====================
ACUTE MEDICAL ISSUES
====================
#6cm infrarenal AAA: CT read at outside hospital raised 
concerning for evidence of hemorrhage into wall and weakening of 
wall concerning for impending rupture. However, per review by 
Dr. ___ ___ vascular surgery team there was no 
radiographic evidence of rupture and emergent surgery was not 
indicated. Vascular surgery team saw him in house and 
recommended optimization of cardiac problems before proceeding 
with an elective AAA repair. To further evaluate the AAA, we 
obtained a dedicated CTA abdomen. Vascular surgery reviewed 
imaging and appears amenable to physician modified ___. He 
was asymptomatic from the AAA standpoint. 

From a cardiology standpoint, we would like to treat with 
uninterrupted anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks at which time 
we will repeat TEE to assess atrial thrombus. If thrombus has 
resolved, consider for cardioversion pending repeat assessment 
of EF at that time. If has cardioversion, would need to be 
followed by another 4 weeks of uninterrupted anticoagulation. 

# HFrEF, acute: Initial Outside hospital TTE showed LVEF 35% 
with inferior WMA, moderate MR/TR, moderate AI and AS while 
patient was in atrial fibrillation. On repeat at ___ while in 
afib with improved rate control showed LVEF 45-50%. He reported 
no functional limitations at home prior to this incident without 
PND, or orthopnea. He underwent a cardiac cath on ___ which 
showed coronary disease (99% stenosis of distal LCx) though not 
significant enough to explain his degree of cardiomyopathy. 
Suspect cardiomyopathy is tachycardia-mediated and may improve 
with cardioversion. Should plan for cardioversion if repeat TEE 
in 4 weeks shows resolution of atrial thrombus and persistent 
reduced EF while in atrial fibrillation. Will discharge on every 
other day dosing of lasix 20 mg. 

# NSTEMI: Presented with lateral STDs on EKG on admission, mild 
troponinemia which has not been rising. Suspect this represents 
a type II NSTEMI secondary to demand ischemia, however could 
have had a missed event several days prior to admission. Cardiac 
cath did show significant a 99% stenosis of distal LCx which was 
not revascularized as did not seem to be supplying significant 
portion of myocardium and given need for surgery in near future 
did not want to commit patient to ___ year of uninterrupted DAPT. 
Optimized medication regimen with ASA, statin, and beta blocker.

# A. fib w/ RVR: Unclear trigger, but suspect may have been 
missed ischemic event as above. Patient was initially held off 
of anticoagulation due to possible need for surgery but once 
deemed stable was started on apixaban 5mg BID (CHADs2-VASc score 
is 4). Patient was initially started on an esmolol gtt but 
eventually transitioned to PO metoprolol succinate 200mg QAM and 
100mg QPM and PO digoxin 0.125mg daily with good control of 
rates. Patient had a TEE in anticipation of cardioversion but 
discovered a left atrial thrombus so cardioversion was aborted. 
Patient will need to remain on uninterrupted for 4 weeks and 
have a repeat TEE at that time to assess for resolution of 
atrial thrombus.  Should also assess ejection fraction at that 
time and if still compromised, consider cardioversion for 
possible tachycardia mediated cardiomyopathy.

# Leukocytosis: Patient presented with leukocytosis in the range 
of ___ with no clear evidence of infection clinically or on 
imaging. In ___ he had had a WBC of 18 on outside labs which he 
brought in for our review. Heme/onc reviewed smear which 
contained signficant left shift and circulating blast count of 
2%. No dysplastic features seen. He was initially given ATRA on 
___ due to concern for APML. However,given the absence of a 
significant number of circulating blasts in the periphery this 
was felt to be unlikely. ___ was sent for BCR/ABL PCR and was 
negative.  This effectively excludes a diagnosis of chronic 
myelogenous leukemia.  Per heme/onc, given low blast count and 
leukocytosis on previous testing, very unlikely to be an acute 
leukemia.  On ___, patient underwent bone marrow biopsy.  
Results pending.  Patient has a follow-up appointment with the 
oncology team on ___ to review results of bone marrow biopsy.
  
# ___: Unknown baseline, Cr 1.8 on admission downtrended to 1.1 
on discharge.  Likely cardiorenal in the setting of heart 
failure exacerbation on admission.  Patient was given IV 
diuresis with improvement in creatinine.  Patient likely has 
mild CKD although do not have baseline to compare to.

# s/p Tobacco use disorder: had quit prior to admission. 

====================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
====================
[] Atrial fibrillation and left atrial thrombus: Rate is well 
controlled at discharge on metoprolol and digoxin.  Patient 
should remain on Eliquis 5 mg twice daily uninterrupted and 
should have repeat TEE in 4 weeks to reassess left atrial 
thrombus.  If ejection fraction still compromised at that time 
please consider cardioversion for potential tachycardia induced 
cardiomyopathy.
[] Should have repeat digoxin level drawn on ___ to make sure 
at therapeutic level given possible interaction with statin.
[] Please check BMP 1 week after discharge and if creatinine 
stable consider starting an ACE inhibitor to optimize heart 
failure treatment.
[] On CT torso patient was noted to have several sub-solid 
pulmonary nodules measuring less than 6 mm for which follow-up 
with CT chest in ___ months as recommended by radiology.
[] Bone marrow biopsy results are pending at time of discharge.  
Patient will follow-up appointment with hematology to review 
results as outpatient.  Please ensure patient is aware of 
appointment and any hematology recommendations.
[] Patient will be discharged on Lasix 20 mg every other day.  
Patient advised to check his weight daily and notify his 
physician if weight increases by more than 3 pounds in 1 day.  
If weight continues to increase will likely need to uptitrate 
diuretic and increased frequency.

Discharge Instructions:
 Dear Mr. ___,
  
It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___!  

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?  
==========================   
- You were admitted because your heart rate was very fast and 
you were short of breath.

WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL?  
==============================  
- You were transferred to ___ due to concern about an enlarged 
blood vessel in your abdomen (AAA).
- Vascular surgery reviewed your imaging and will plan on 
surgery when your heart rate is stabilized and they can 
interrupt your anticoagulation.
- You were diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. Your heart rate 
was controlled with medications (metoprolol and digoxin). 
- You were also started on a blood thinner (apixaban AKA 
ELiquis) for stroke prevention. 
- You were found to have a blood clot in your heart, which means 
your anticoagulation needs to be uninterrupted for 4 weeks.   
- You underwent a bone marrow biopsy on ___ and you tolerated 
the procedure well. 

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME?  
================================  
- Please take all your medications as prescribed.
- Please arrange to establish with a primary care doctor within 
1 week of discharge.
- Please go to your follow up appointments as scheduled below 
with cardiology, hematology, and vascular surgery.
- Please refrain from showering for 24 hours after your bone 
marrow biopsy.
- You will need to remain on anticoagulation (eliquis) 
uninterrupted for at least the next 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, you 
should undergo another transesophageal echocardiogram to 
reassess the clot. If it has resolved, then you should discuss 
with your Cardiologist about cardioversion.
- Your surgeon will be in coordination with your Cardiologist to 
decide the safest timing of surgery.
- Weigh yourself when you get home and every morning. If your 
weight changes more than 2 lbs. within 24 hours, call your 
physician for management of your heart failure medications.

Thank you for allowing us to be involved in your care, we wish 
you all the best!
